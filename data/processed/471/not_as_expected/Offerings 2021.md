**MiFID II product governance/Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for the purposes**
of each manufacturer's product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes described in this
Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such Notes is eligible counterparties
("ECPs") and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments, as
amended ("MiFID II"); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such Notes to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate.
Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such Notes (a "distributor") should take into consideration
the manufacturers' target market assessment; however, a Distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its
own target market assessment in respect of such Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers' target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition of sales to EEA (as defined herein) retail investors: The Notes described in the attached Offering**
Memorandum are not intended to be offered or sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered or sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one

Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, as amended (the "PRIIPs Regulation"), for offering or selling any in scope instrument or
otherwise making such instruments available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared. Offering or selling the Notes

The attached Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any Member
State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the "Prospectus Regulation")
from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes. The attached Offering Memorandum is not a

would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it

NH Hotel Group, S.A., a public limited company (sociedad anónima) established under the laws of Spain (the "Issuer"), is offering
€400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its      % Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the "Notes"). The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes
semi-annually in arrears on           and           of each year, commencing on          , 2021. The Notes will mature on          , 2026.
At any time prior to          , 2023, the Issuer may redeem all or a portion of the Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice by paying a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus a "make-whole" premium. In addition, at any
time prior to          , 2023, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net proceeds from certain equity
offerings at the redemption price set forth in this Offering Memorandum. At any time on or after          , 2023, the Issuer may redeem all or a portion
of the Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum. Prior to          ,
2023, the Issuer may redeem during each twelve-month period commencing with the Issue Date up to 10% of the original principal amount of the Notes
upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice to holders of the Notes, at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to the applicable redemption date. Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required
to make an offer to purchase the Notes. In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the
Notes.

The Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer. The Notes will rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future indebtedness of
the Issuer that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of the
Issuer that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The Notes will be guaranteed (the "Notes Guarantees") on a senior basis by certain subsidiaries
of the Issuer (the "Guarantors"). The Guarantors also guarantee the Senior Secured RCF (as defined herein) and the COVID Related ICO Facilities (as
defined herein). The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be initially secured by (i) charges over the shares of capital stock representing 100% of the share
capital of (A) Immo Hotel Brugge NV, Immo Hotel Diegem NV, Immo Hotel Mechelen NV, Hotel Exploitatiemaatschappij Diegem NV and Immo Hotel
Stephanie NV, in each case, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer organized under the laws of Belgium, (B) NH Italia S.p.A., a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Issuer organized under the laws of Italy and (C) Onroerend Goed Beheer Maatschappij Van Alphenstraat Zandvoort B.V., a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Issuer incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, in the case of each of sub-clause (A) and (C) on a first-ranking basis and in
the case of subclause (B) on a second-ranking basis but deemed and treated as first-ranking security interests under the Intercreditor Agreement, and
(ii) mortgages over certain hotels owned by wholly owned subsidiaries of the Issuer or the Issuer located in the Netherlands (collectively, the "Collateral").
The Senior Secured RCF (as defined herein) is secured by the same Collateral as the Notes and will benefit from the proceeds of enforcement of the
Collateral on a pro rata and pari passu basis with the Notes, as described under "Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement". The Notes Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to legal and contractual limitations. See "Risk factors—Risks relating to the Notes and_
_our structure—The Notes Guarantees and security interests in the Collateral are significantly limited by applicable laws and are subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement or defenses" and "Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests and certain_
_insolvency law considerations". The Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral will also be subject to restrictions on_
enforcement.

This Offering Memorandum includes information on the terms of the Notes and Notes Guarantees, including redemption and repurchase prices,
covenants and transfer restrictions.

There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application has been or will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and admit the Notes to trading on the Euro MTF. The Euro MTF of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange is not a regulated market as defined
by Article 4, paragraph 1, point 21 of MiFID II. There is no assurance that the Notes will be listed and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF. This Offering

Securities Act"), or the securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes are being offered and sold in the

**_European Economic Area: This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers of the_**
Notes will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation (as defined below), from the requirement
to produce a prospectus for offers of securities. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within
the European Economic Area ("EEA") or any of its member states ("Member States") of the Notes which are the subject
of the Offering contemplated in this Offering Memorandum, should only do so in circumstances in which no obligation
arises for the Issuer or the Initial Purchaser to produce a prospectus for such offer pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus
Regulation or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 23 of the Prospectus Regulation. Neither the Issuer nor the
Initial Purchaser has authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of the Notes through any financial
intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchaser, which constitute the final offering of the Notes
contemplated in this Offering Memorandum. Further, neither the Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers has authorized,
nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of securities in circumstances in which an obligation arises for the Issuer
or the Initial Purchasers to publish or supplement a prospectus for the offering of the Notes. In relation to each Member
State, an offer of the Notes to the public may not be made in that Member State other than:

(i) to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation;

(ii) subject to the following paragraph concerning the PRIIPS Regulation, to fewer than 150
natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus Regulation), as permitted
under the Prospectus Regulation, subject to obtaining the prior consent of the relevant dealer or dealers
nominated by the Issuer for any such offer; or

(iii) in any other circumstances falling within Article 1(4) of the Prospectus Regulation,

provided that no such offer of Notes shall require the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus
pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 23 of the Prospectus
Regulation.

**Presentation of financial and other information**

This Offering Memorandum includes audited consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the
years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020. This Offering Memorandum also includes unaudited condensed interim
consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2021 (which includes
information for the comparative period for the three months ended March 31, 2020), which have been subject to limited
review. The consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of financial
position and consolidated statement of cash flows (1) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020,
except for the footnotes included below each table and except as otherwise indicated, have been derived from the audited
consolidated financial statements for such periods of the Group, which were audited by Deloitte, S.L. as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2018 and by PricewaterhouseCoopers Auditores, S.L. as of and for the years ended December
31, 2019 and 2020 and have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and (2) as of March 31, 2021 and for the three
months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 have been derived from the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial
statements of the Group as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2021, which were subject to limited review by
PricewaterhouseCoopers Auditores, S.L. and have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34. This summary financial
information is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at
any future date.

The financial information presented for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 is prepared by adding the
results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to the results of operations for the year ended December
31, 2020 and subtracting the results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The summary financial
information of the Group for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 presented herein is not required by or presented in
accordance with IFRS or generally accepted accounting principles. It has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and
is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for the twelve months at such date, for any future period or
our financial condition at any such date.

The summary unaudited pro forma financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum has been
derived by applying pro forma adjustments to certain of the Group's historical consolidated financial information. The
summary unaudited pro forma financial information gives effect to the Refinancing as described in "Use of proceeds", as
though it had occurred on April 1, 2020 for pro forma financial information relating to statement of comprehensive
income and on March 31, 2021 for pro forma financial information relating to statement of financial position. The
unaudited pro forma adjustments and the unaudited pro forma financial information set forth below are based upon

available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and may differ from actual
amounts. The pro forma financial information is for informational purposes only and does not purport to present what our
results would actually have been had these transactions occurred on the dates presented or to project our results of
operations or financial position for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.

Certain numerical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial data presented in millions or
in thousands, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in the Offering
Memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information.

**Use of non-IFRS financial measures**

Certain parts of this Offering Memorandum contain non-IFRS measures and ratios, including EBITDA,
EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted operating cash flow, adjusted operating cash
flow (after capital expenditure), pro forma net indebtedness, pro forma net indebtedness secured by the Collateral and
changes in working capital.

We define EBITDA as profit (loss) attributable to shareholders of the Issuer plus non-controlling interests plus
profit (loss) for the year from discontinued operations net of tax minus corporation tax, gain (loss) on disposal of
financial investments, net exchange rate differences, financial expenses, change in fair value of financial instruments,
financial income, profit (loss) from entities valued through the equity method, variation in the provision for onerous
contracts, net losses from asset impairment, depreciation and inventory impairments.

We define EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by net turnover.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for the effect of certain non-recurring items, including gains
or losses from disposals of assets, the variation in the provisions for liabilities and advisory and consultancy expenses,
non-recurring personnel expenses, adjustments for the effect of the application of IFRS 16, non-recurring lease impacts,
and other non-recurring items.

We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net turnover.

We define adjusted operating cash flow as total net cash flow from operating activities minus the impact of
IFRS 16.

We defined adjusted operating cash flow (after capital expenditure) as adjusted operating cash flow minus
capital expenditure.

We define pro forma net indebtedness as indebtedness of the Group on a consolidated basis (excluding
operating lease liabilities and the Shareholder Loan), less cash and cash equivalents of the Group on a consolidated basis,
on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions.

We define pro forma net indebtedness secured by the Collateral as the portion of pro forma net indebtedness that
is secured by the Collateral, less cash and cash equivalents of the Group on a consolidated basis, on an as adjusted basis
after giving effect to the Transactions.

We define RevPAR as the product of the Average Daily Rate for a specific period multiplied by the Occupancy
for that period.

We define Occupancy as the quotient of the total number of Room Nights sold during a specific period divided
by the total number of hotel rooms available for each day during such specific period.

We define Average Daily Rate as the quotient of total room revenues for a specified period divided by total
Room Nights sold during that period.

We define changes in working capital as the sum of the movements in inventories, trade and other receivables,
other current assets, trade creditors and other current liabilities and charges as derived from the cash flow statements.

EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted operating cash flow,
adjusted operating cash flow (after capital expenditure), pro forma net indebtedness, pro forma net indebtedness secured
by the Collateral, changes in working capital, ADR, Occupancy and RevPAR are non-IFRS measures. We use these
non-IFRS measures as internal measures of performance and liquidity to benchmark and compare performance and
liquidity, both between our own operations and as against other companies. We use these non-IFRS measures, together
with measures of performance or liquidity under IFRS, to compare the relative performance or liquidity of operations in
planning, budgeting and reviewing the performance or liquidity of various businesses. We believe these non-IFRS

xiv


-----

measures are useful and commonly used measures of financial performance or liquidity in addition to operating profit
and other profitability measures, cash flow provided by operating activities and other cash flow measures and other
measures of financial position under IFRS because they facilitate operating performance, cash flow and financial position
comparisons from period to period, time to time and company to company. By eliminating potential differences between
periods or companies caused by factors such as depreciation and amortization methods, financing and capital structures
and taxation positions or regimes, we believe these non-IFRS measures can provide a useful additional basis for
comparing the current performance or liquidity of the underlying operations being evaluated. For these reasons, we
believe these non-IFRS measures and similar measures are regularly used by the investment community as a means of
comparing companies in our industry. Different companies and analysts may calculate EBITDA, EBITDA margin,
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted operating cash flow, adjusted operating cash flow (after capital
expenditure), pro forma net indebtedness, pro forma net indebtedness secured by the Collateral, changes in working
capital, ADR, Occupancy and RevPAR differently, so making comparisons among companies on this basis should be
done very carefully. EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted operating cash
flow, adjusted operating cash flow (after capital expenditure), pro forma net indebtedness, pro forma net indebtedness
secured by the Collateral and changes in working capital are not measures of performance or liquidity under IFRS and
should not be considered in isolation or construed as a substitute for net operating profit or as an indicator of our cash
flow from operations, investment activities or financing activities or as an indicator of financial position in accordance
with IFRS. For the calculation of EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted
operating cash flow, adjusted operating cash flow (after capital expenditure), changes in working capital, pro forma net
indebtedness, pro forma net indebtedness secured by the Collateral, ADR, Occupancy and RevPAR, see "Summary
_financial and other information"._

**Other data**

**_Duff & Phelps Report_**

Duff & Phelps has carried out a valuation of the Mortgage Properties and the Share Collateral as of
December 31, 2020. The valuation determined by Duff & Phelps is based upon certain qualifications and assumptions,
estimates and projections. We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used, estimates made or procedures
followed in the valuation of our property portfolio are correct, accurate or complete. See "Business—Valuation of the
_Collateral"._

Neither Duff & Phelps, nor any person acting on Duff & Phelps' behalf, makes any warranty, express or
implied, or assumes any liability with respect to the reliance upon or use of any information or analysis disclosed in the
Duff & Phelps Report. Any conclusions reached in the Duff & Phelps Report depend upon a number of assumptions and
economic conditions that may or may not occur.

Duff & Phelps stated that in developing its conclusion of value, it considered the three generally accepted
approaches used for estimating the market value of an asset: market, cost and income. The appropriate approach for
estimating the market value depends on the nature and the circumstances surrounding the asset under consideration.
Duff & Phelps' valuation of hotels that constitute part of the Collateral and of NH Italia’s Shares was based upon the
income approach using the discounted free cash flow ("DCF") method, which according to Duff & Phelps, is the
generally accepted approach for the valuation of a business or assets on a going-concern basis. For a detailed discussion
of the valuation methodology, see "Business—Valuation of the Collateral—Basis of valuation and assumptions".

All conclusions are based upon information available at the time of review. A pledge over the shares of the
Diegem Entities and Zandvoort will initially secure the Notes, as well as the Senior Secured RCF, on a pari passu basis
and a pledge over the NH Italia Shares will initially secure the Notes (on a second ranking basis) and the Senior Secured
RCF (on a first-ranking basis), as described under "Description of certain financing arrangements―Intercreditor
_Agreement". The valuation of the NH Italia Shares deducts the liabilities of NH Italia. The proceeds of any sale of the_
Collateral may vary significantly from the valuation of the Collateral. Duff & Phelps has not independently investigated
or otherwise verified the historical data provided by us. Changes in factors upon which the review was based could affect
the results. The financial forecasts used in the preparation of this report reflect management's judgment, based on present
circumstances and assuming certain conditions and actions by us. Forecasts are inherently uncertain because of events or
combinations of events that cannot reasonably be foreseen, including the actions of government, individuals, third parties
and competitors.

Data based upon the Duff & Phelps Report that is included in this Offering Memorandum involves risks and
uncertainties and is subject to change based upon a variety of external factors. In particular, the valuation is based upon
certain assumptions regarding recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the future impact of the
pandemic on our business is difficult to predict. See “Risk factors―Risks relating to our business and industry―The
_COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on our industry and business, and may continue to have a_
_significant negative impact in the future.” Collateral value as presented in the Offering Memorandum may differ from_

-----

"Collateral Value" as defined in the "Description of the Notes." See "Risk factors—Risks relating to our business and
_industry—The value of our properties reflected on our balance sheet and in this Offering Memorandum and the book_
_value of our hotels and assets included in this Offering Memorandum is based in part upon the results of third-party_
_valuations, and because property and asset valuation is inherently subjective and uncertain, the projections or_
_assumptions used, estimates made or procedures followed in the third-party valuation of our properties and assets may_
_not be correct, accurate or complete and may suffer severe devaluations due to the COVID-19 pandemic" and "Risk_
_factors—Risks relating to the Notes and our structure—The projections or assumptions used, estimates made or_
_procedures followed in the Duff & Phelps Report for the valuation of the Collateral may not be correct, accurate or_
_complete, and investors in the Notes will have no recourse against the third-party property valuation provider"._

**_Other operating measures_**

In addition to EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted operating
cash flow, adjusted operating cash flow (after capital expenditure), pro forma net indebtedness, pro forma net
indebtedness secured by the Collateral and changes in working capital, we have included other operating information in
this Offering Memorandum, some of which we refer to as "key performance indicators", including RevPAR, Occupancy,
Room Nights and Average Daily Rate. We believe that it is useful to include this operating information as we use it for
internal performance analysis, and the presentation by our business divisions of these measures facilitates comparability
with other companies in our industry, although our measures may not be comparable with similar measurements
presented by other companies. Such operating information should not be considered in isolation or construed as a
substitute for measures in accordance with IFRS. For a description of certain of our key performance indicators, see
"Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Key Factors affecting our
_financial condition and results of operations—Occupancy, Average Daily Rate (ADR) and Revenue per Available Room_
_(RevPAR)"._

We present in this Offering Memorandum a geographical breakdown of our sales and our operating data as
follows: (1) Spain, which includes Spain, Portugal, France, Andorra, Tunisia and the United States; (2) Italy; (3) Central
Europe, which includes Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Switzerland;
(4) Benelux, which includes Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Ireland and the United Kingdom; and (5) Latin
America, which includes Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Haiti, Mexico and Uruguay. Although we
do not currently have plans to change our operating structure, we may do so in the future. See "Business—Principal
_business activities—Hotel operations—Operational structure"._

**Market and industry data**

In this Offering Memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and the markets in
which we operate and compete. Such market and industry data and certain industry forward-looking statements are
derived from various industry and other independent sources, where available. In particular, certain information
regarding the valuation of the Mortgage Properties and the Share Properties as of December 31, 2020 has been derived
from the Duff & Phelps Report produced solely for our use. The aforementioned third party sources generally state that
the information they contain has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable. However, these third party sources
also state that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed and that the projections they contain
are based on significant assumptions. In particular, the valuation of our properties may suffer severe devaluation due to
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The information in this Offering Memorandum that has been sourced from third
parties has been accurately reproduced and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain from the information published
by such third parties, no facts have been omitted that would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, such third-party information has not been independently verified, and neither we nor the
Initial Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of such information set forth in
this Offering Memorandum.

In addition, certain information in this Offering Memorandum for which no source is given, regarding our
market position relative to our competitors in the hotel industry, is not based upon published statistical data or
information obtained from independent third parties. Such information and statements reflect our best estimates based
upon information obtained from trade and business organizations and associations and other contacts within the
industries in which we compete, as well as information published by our competitors. To the extent that no source is
given for information contained in this Offering Memorandum, or such information is identified as being our belief, that
information is based upon the following: (i) in respect of market share, information obtained from trade and business
organizations and associations and other contacts within the industries in which we compete and internal analysis of our
sales data, and unless otherwise stated, market share is based upon number of hotel rooms in operation; (ii) in respect of
industry trends, our senior management team's general business experience, as well as their experience in our industry
and the local markets in which we operate; and (iii) in respect of the performance of our operations, our internal analysis
of our audited and unaudited financial and other information. As some of the foregoing information was compiled or

provided by our management or advisors and is not publicly available, such information accordingly may not be
considered to be as independent as that provided by other third-party sources.

**Our business**

We are a leading international hotel operator and we are ranked among the top ten largest hotel chains in Europe
by number of hotel rooms, according to the latest available Hospitality On report. As of March 31, 2021, we operated
355 hotels consisting of 54,806 hotel rooms in 29 countries.

Based on a report by an independent market research firm, and measured by number of hotel rooms in
operation, as of December 2019, we were the third largest hotel chain in the Netherlands, the fourth largest in Italy and
Belgium, the fifth largest in Spain and Portugal and the eighth largest in Germany. Of the 355 hotels we operated as of
March 31, 2021, we owned 73 (or 22% by number of hotel rooms), we leased 229 (or 65% by number of hotel rooms)
and we managed 53 hotels (or 14% by number of hotel rooms) owned or leased by third parties pursuant to management
agreements. We believe that our versatile operating structure and our geographic diversity enhance our resilience to
industry cycles while also providing us with flexibility to take advantage of future growth opportunities.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, our net turnover was €320.4 million and our Adjusted EBITDA
was negative €426.5 million. Our net turnover and Adjusted EBITDA increased from €1,613.4 million and
€264.5 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2018 to €1,708.1 million and €319.4 million, respectively,
in the year ended December 31, 2019. Our net turnover and Adjusted EBITDA decreased from €277.0 million and
negative €31.4 million, respectively, in the three months ended March 31, 2020, to €61.2 million and negative
€112.3 million, respectively, in the three months ended March 31, 2021. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, our
Occupancy, ADR and RevPAR were 14.3%, €65.5 and €9.4, respectively. For further information on these performance
measures, see "Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Key factors
_affecting our financial condition and results of operation—Occupancy, Average Daily Rate (ADR) and Revenue per_
_Available Room (RevPAR)"._

We have a centralized business model that allows us to provide a consistent level of service to customers across
hotels in different regions and to achieve economies of scale. Our central corporate and regional offices provide our
hotels with a wide variety of key functions, including sales, reservations, marketing, administrative and IT systems.

We have strengthened our brand proposition by reorganizing our hotels into an upper-upscale segment, an
upscale segment and a mid-tier segment and we have developed the following core dedicated brands, each tailored to
represent a clearly defined level of service, quality and value:

    - _NH Collection is our upper-upscale urban segment brand, which consists of our best properties and is_
designed for clients that are willing to pay a premium for higher quality products and services;

    - _NHOW is our upper-upscale design brand, for which we do not have a standard design applied across_
all hotels. Instead, we have combined new forms of contemporary architecture, design and luxury by
prestigious architects and interior designers to create an elegant and extravagant experience for our
guests; and

    - _NH Hotels remains our core brand for our upscale segment hotels, which consists of urban hotels with_
higher standards and more detail-oriented product and service levels, and our mid-tier urban segment
hotels, which focus on delivering value and comfort for our customers.

Since their public tender offer in 2018, we have benefitted from the industry knowledge and support of MINT,
which operates over 172 hotels and resorts across Asia, Australia, Africa, the Middle East and South America. As a result
of the integration of the Group into Minor Hotels (an affiliate of MINT), the parties have agreed to a joint brand
positioning for all markets and segments, on the basis of the reciprocal master licensing agreement signed between the
parties on February 7, 2019 allowing each party to use the other party's corresponding commercial brands in the
geographical areas where each party operates. The brands covered by this master licensing agreement comprise Anantara,
Avani, Tivoli and Oaks (in each case with Minor Hotels as licensor) and the brands NH Collection, NH Hotels and

1


-----

NHOW (in each case with the Group as licensor). As a result of this master licensing agreement, we have increased the
number of brands we offer in the luxury and upscale segment and currently operate six hotels in Europe under the luxury
Anantara brand and 10 hotels under the upper-upscale Tivoli brand:

    - Anantara is an award-winning and world-renowned Asian luxury brand offering both design and
service-led timeless experiences. Positioned in key markets around the globe, Anantara hotels, resorts
and spas open up a window to the modern character of their destination, upholding world-class
operational standards to make every stay uniquely personal; and

    - _Tivoli is a collection of upscale and deluxe properties in prime locations around the world. Tivoli is_
now a global brand, with destinations ranging from idyllic beach settings in Brazil to cosmopolitan city
spots across Europe and luxury locations in the Middle East. Every Tivoli hotel is unique. Some are
inspired by exotic surroundings, others offer a touch of metropolitan luxury. Each one delivers
consistent premium service combined with impeccable taste and comfort.

Since 2013, we have implemented various upgrades and refined our brands across our operations. This has
included investing in upgraded basic facilities, such as flat screen televisions and rain showers, and refining our dining
and beverage options. We have worked to align our hotels with particular brand aesthetics to create a comfortable and
standardized experience for our customers. We have also implemented a centralized pricing strategy which organizes
price by destination, allowing us to structure relative prices among our various hotels in each destination, and by room
type. Through this pricing mechanism, guests may choose to upgrade for more desirable features, such as a better view.
We have refurbished several of our leased and owned hotels, which have generally shown improved Occupancy,
RevPAR and ADR as a result, and have overhauled our IT systems, launching a new website and completing the
migration of our back office systems to SAP, an enterprise software system which integrates our front and back office
and computer reservation systems, in all business units ("BUs").

In the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year, all regions reported a decrease in RevPAR,
which is principally due to the low levels of occupancy beginning in March 2020 across all regions due to the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic. The second quarter of the year was the most affected quarter during the pandemic due to
lockdowns in various countries, temporary hotel closures and travel restrictions, which were reinstated in the last few
months of 2020. In particular, for our hotels in Spain, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by 71.4%, 22.9% and 63.0%,
respectively, in 2020 compared with 2019. For our hotels in Central Europe, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by
67.3%, 16.4% and 60.9%, respectively, in 2020 compared with 2019. For our hotels in Italy, RevPAR, ADR and
Occupancy fell by 75.4%, 22.3% and 68.3%, respectively, in 2020 compared with 2019. For our hotels in Benelux,
RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by 74.2%, 18.2% and 68.4%, respectively, in 2020 compared with 2019 and, in Latin
America, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by 76.7%, 21.7% and 70.3%, respectively, in 2020 compared with 2019,
which was also due to the negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

In the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter in 2020, all regions reported a decrease in RevPAR,
which is principally due to the low levels of occupancy beginning in March 2020 across all regions. The first quarter of
2021 has been affected by lockdowns in various countries, temporary hotel closures and travel restrictions, which largely
remained in effect during the beginning of 2021. In particular, for our hotels in Spain, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell
by 71.2%, 32.7% and 57.3%, respectively in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. For our
hotels in Central Europe, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by 88.4%, 29.6% and 83.5% respectively in the first quarter
of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. For our hotels in Italy, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by 65.9%,
25.6% and 54.2%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. For our hotels in
Benelux, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by 88.2%, 28.7% and 83.5%, respectively in the first quarter of 2021 as
compared to the same period in 2020 and in Latin America, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by 72.5%, 34.1% and
58.2% respectively, in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, which was also due to the
negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

We actively manage our asset portfolio, including our 73 owned hotels which had a book value of €1.3 billion as
of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, although we believe that the actual market value of such assets is higher, due
to the fact that prices at which we have been able to sell our assets in recent years have been typically higher than their
respective book values. Between June 2020 and February 2021, 30 owned hotels that are Mortgage Properties or
properties that are owned by entities whose shares form part of the Share Collateral were appraised by third parties and
were assigned a market value of approximately €875 million, while their book value as of December 31, 2020 is recorded
as approximately €593 million. This means that market value for those 30 appraised hotels exceeds their book value by
approximately 48%. We regularly evaluate the performance of individual hotels to identify underperforming properties,
and aim to terminate, or not renew, lease agreements and management agreements for underperforming hotels, in
particular if they contain undesirable terms (such as management agreements with costly performance guarantees), as
well as to sell certain of our underperforming owned hotels and redirect our resources to markets and hotels where our
operations have been successful. One of the ways in which we actively redirect our resources is to increase the proportion

of our operations conducted under management arrangements in order to take advantage of the less capital intensive
nature of management arrangements.

In addition, we are actively working to continue to increase Occupancy and Average Daily Rates through
selective investments, including refurbishment of existing hotels and opening new hotels. We also intend to complete the
streamlining of our operating platforms to increase efficiency. To date, we have migrated most of our back office systems
to SAP, and we have invested in the development of our website (with a focus on a mobile-friendly interface as our
customers increasingly access our website through their mobile devices) with increased functionality in order to increase
the proportion of direct bookings. In the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, the proportion of
revenue generated from our website grew from 11.5% to 14.3%. We also seek to reallocate our resources to grow in the
markets where we believe there is increasing demand for hotel rooms and where we currently have limited presence.
During 2020, we opened 11 hotels with 1,966 rooms in markets where we believe there is increasing demand for hotel
rooms and we closed 17 hotels with 3,866 rooms.

As of March 31, 2021, we have entered into agreements to operate 20 new hotels with 3,739 rooms (our
"committed pipeline hotels"), which are expected to commence operations mainly between 2021 and 2023. We will
operate our committed pipeline hotels under lease and management agreements with third-party hotel owners and most of
our committed pipeline hotels will be operated under our core NH Hotels and NH Collection brands. We estimate that we
will invest a total of approximately €30 million into our committed pipeline hotels between 2021 and 2023.

We are a public limited company (sociedad anónima) incorporated under the laws of Spain and listed on the
Spanish Stock Exchanges with an authorized share capital of €784,360,486 consisting of 392,180,243 shares as of
March 31, 2021. Our market capitalization was €1.6 billion as of June 11, 2021.

**Our strengths**

**_We operate in the hotel and travel industry, which benefits from key growth trends despite the effects of the COVID-_**
**_19 pandemic_**

In 2020, the hotel industry is expected to see its worldwide revenue decrease to an estimated $692 billion from
$946 billion in 2019, as a result of the travel restrictions and lockdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Europe
(which represents 31.7% of the global market), revenue generated by the hotel industry is expected to decrease to an
estimated $220 billion in 2020 from $310 billion in 2019.

However, according to Marketline, the global hotel industry is expected to recover quickly in the coming years.
It forecasts that the global industry will grow at a compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") of 10.9% from 2020 to 2025
and at a CAGR of 10.7% in Europe over the same period. The industry is forecasted to experience a significant recovery
from 2021 to 2022 in particular, as pandemic-related concerns are expected to lessen and the vaccination rollouts and
containment of the virus are expected to allow countries to encourage tourists to travel again.

The following charts set forth revenue in the global and European hotel industry from 2019 to 2025 (with

According to HVS, European hotel performance declined significantly in 2020 compared to 2019, with an
average RevPAR for European hotels dropping from €80 in 2019 to €24 in 2020. HVS anticipates that RevPAR will
remain low in the first half of 2021 and will build up in the second half of 2021 to recover to 2019 levels by 2023.

Once travel restrictions are lifted, an immediate and significant recovery in tourism-related demand is expected
and Europe is anticipated to be well placed to benefit from this trend. According to the United Nations World Tourism
Organization ("UNWTO"), Europe is the world's most popular tourist destination with a 51% share of global tourist
arrivals in 2019 and a 58% share in 2020. France, Spain and Italy were ranked as first, second and fifth countries,
respectively, in terms of the number of tourist arrivals in 2019. The UNWTO anticipates that the level of international
tourist arrivals seen in 2019 could be achieved again in 2022-2024, depending on the pace of the recovery in demand.

This recovery is expected to be a result of the continuation of several growth trends, which were paused due to
the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on the travel and hotel industry. The global hotel industry has experienced
strong and regular growth in recent years at a CAGR of 7.0% from 2011 to 2019. This growth was primarily due to the
worldwide increase in tourism driven by continued global economic growth and a consistent increase in consumer
disposable income. These trends have mainly been observed in the Asia Pacific region, especially in China and India,
where a growing middle class increasingly has the means and desire to travel internationally for tourism reasons,
particularly to Europe. Additional factors supporting the growth of the hotel industry include improved air connectivity
and the increasing affordability of flights, particularly from low-cost airline carriers in Europe. These trends are expected
to resume their positive contribution to the travel and hotel industry from 2021 onwards.

More broadly, improving macroeconomic conditions are also expected to stimulate the travel and hotel industry.
The past two decades have seen a positive correlation between growth in GDP and travel and tourism related
expenditure. The International Monetary Fund ("IMF") forecasts that the global economy will grow by 6.0% in 2021 and
by 4.4% in 2022. Among developed economies, the United States is expected to surpass its pre-COVID GDP level in
2021, while many other regions are expected to return to their pre-COVID levels in 2022. In the euro area, GDP growth
is expected to rebound by 4.4% in 2021 and by 3.8% in 2022. This is expected to be driven by the continued roll-out of
COVID-19 vaccination programs and a resumption of economic activity.

**_We are a leading European hotel operator with a large and diversified hotel presence and a strongly recognized brand_**

We are a leading international hotel operator, ranked among the top ten hotel chains by number of hotel rooms
in Europe (as of December 31, 2020) and the top 30 globally (as of December 31, 2019), with 355 hotels offering 54,806
rooms across 29 countries as of March 31, 2021. Based on a report by an independent market research firm, and
measured by number of hotel rooms in operation, as of December 31, 2019, we were the third largest hotel chain in the
Netherlands, the fourth largest in Italy and Belgium, and the fifth largest in Spain and Portugal, with a significant
presence in Latin America. Through our geographically diversified footprint, we are well positioned to take advantage of
favorable economic and travel trends in our various local markets, reducing our reliance on particular localities,
supported by a greater contribution from domestic demand, which was as follows in certain of our core countries (based
on 2019 figures): 67% in Germany; 60% in Spain; 48% in Italy; and 47% in the Netherlands.

For more information on our brands, please see "Business—Brand development". Of the hotels included in a
survey conducted in 2019 by GFK, we were the most recognized hotel brand in Spain, ranking second in the country in
the ''core target'' category in relation to brand prompted awareness, which includes business and city travelers. In the
Netherlands and Italy, we ranked fourth and fifth, respectively, in the same ''core target'' category.

In addition, we seek to achieve a growing presence in our other markets, and we seek to successfully expand our
operations into international markets. The European hotel market remains highly fragmented, with a significant portion
of hotels being independently operated, compared to an increasing shift away from independently operated hotels to
branded hotels worldwide. We believe that we are positioned to benefit from increasing levels of brand penetration, as a
result of increasing customer preferences for international and widely recognized hotel brands. We believe customers
prefer international hotel brands, especially compared to independent hotels at similar prices, and we believe we are wellpositioned to benefit from the opportunities to capitalize on the fragmented European hotel markets. Furthermore, our
widely recognized and well-marketed brand enables us to attract customers to our newly opened hotels. We believe that
we have established a reputation as a leading international hotel operator and that this enables us to optimize our market
share compared to local operators.

**_Strong operating performance before the pandemic and well positioned for an industry recovery_**

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, net turnover and Adjusted EBITDA steadily increased from €1,376.6 million
and €138.3 million, respectively, in 2015 to €1,708.1 million and €319.4 million, respectively, in 2019, with 2019 being a

We achieved similar trends of consistent growth in our Occupancy and ADR prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,
which we believe was directly due to our upgrading of our hotel portfolio by prioritizing the refurbishment of our hotels,
resulting in increased profitability. Profitability has also been impacted by the shift from leased to managed hotels.
Additionally, we have improved the quality of leased portfolios through targeted renegotiations, early termination and not
renewing certain lease agreements. For example, in the period from 2018 to 2020, there were 17 lease agreements that
were not renewed. Our portfolio optimization is focused on an asset-light structure with 14% of our properties managed,
22% owned and 65% leased, as at March 31, 2021. This includes 54,806 hotel rooms, which has remained consistent
over the past few years. Operating a similar number of hotel rooms, but higher quality assets, has helped us to build a
more profitable business.

The hospitality sector faced unprecedented challenges in 2020 due to the severe impact of the COVID-19
pandemic. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our net revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, Occupancy and ADR decreased
by 68.6%, 202.7%, 65.1% and 20.2%, respectively, during the year ended December 30, 2020. Despite various
lockdowns and travel restrictions around the world, the operating and financial transformation we achieved in previous
years, together with the contingency measures implemented, have enabled us to address the challenges of this
extraordinary complex year and safeguard our business continuity. The flexible cost structure is one of our competitive
advantages, which has allowed for the reopening of more than 300 hotels since June 2020 to capture domestic customers'
demand, resulting in 80% of our portfolio being open in August 2020. Due to the impact of a second wave of COVID-19,
with new travel restrictions and lockdowns imposed after the summer, many hotels closed again, and the percentage of
hotels open in December 2020 dropped to 60%. However, since the beginning of 2021, the gradual roll out of
vaccination programs, together with the progressive easing of restrictions in some European countries, has allowed us to
accelerate the reopening of our portfolio. As such, at the end of May 2021, approximately 78% of hotels in our portfolio
were open.

In anticipation of travel restrictions being lifted, we believe we are well positioned for an industry recovery. The
recovery in domestic leisure demand is already noticeable and is gaining momentum, as Europe gradually increases its
vaccination rate, consumers gain confidence and governments start to ease restrictions. In 2019, the proportion of
revenues coming from the business to customer channel was 60% with the remaining 40% coming from the business to
business channel. We believe that this historical business mix will facilitate our prospects for a recovery in our operating
performance, as we believe that demand from leisure travelers is more likely to rebound quicker than demand from
business travelers. Although we expect our leisure travelers to return more quickly than business travelers, we have
implemented initiatives to entice business travelers, including extended stays, providing discounts of up to 35% for stays
longer than seven days, large work spaces for business travelers to work in or use for group meetings, and virtual meeting
capabilities.

The following graph sets forth these initiatives in more detail:


**Up to 35% on stays from seven days to work away**
**from home during a long period or enjoy a longer**
**holiday vacation**


**New innovative business to business proposal with**
**exclusive spaces to work and organize small business**
**meetings taking advantage of all the benefits of our**
**hotels (day-use room, gyms, restaurant)**


**To enhance the value of the events reaching a greater**
**audience from different destinations combining in-**
**person and virtual attendees**

The recovery phase likely will be driven initially by domestic and intra-European demand. In 2019, intraEuropean demand representing between 71-76% of our revenues with domestic demand at 67% in Germany; 60% in
Spain; 48% in Italy; and 47% in the Netherlands during the same period.

Additionally, our hotels are in desirable and attractive locations and well-visited cities that are among the most
popular tourist destinations such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Madrid and Milan. Our hotels are located in city centers
close to tourist attractions. Due to travel restrictions, in the third quarter of 2020, domestic occupancy increased. This
demonstrates that our recovery is not fully reliant on international tourism normalizing to their pre-pandemic levels.

Our ability to benefit from an anticipated recovery in the industry is helped by our strong brand identity. In a
survey conducted in 2019 by GFK, we were one of the most recognized hotel brands in Spain, ranking second in the
country in the "core target" category in relation to brand prompted awareness, which includes business and city travelers.
In the Netherlands and Italy, we ranked fourth and fifth, respectively, in the same category. We also monitor customer
satisfaction through our "Quality Focus On Line" tool, which analyzes results for both individual hotels and for our
Group in the aggregate.

**_Robust cash flow generation following the completion of the investment program and significant action taken on costs_**
**_and cash flow to mitigate the effects of the pandemic_**

Our robust cash flow generation demonstrates that we are fully oriented toward improving efficiency to improve
our profitability. Following the completion of significant capital expenditure investments made from 2014 to 2016, our
historical operating cash flow generation has since offset our capital expenditure. Our Total net cash flow from operating

activities increased from €32.1 million in 2014 to €505.3 million in 2019, due in large part to the impact of IFRS 16, and
decreased to negative €94.1 million in 2020, mainly due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the same period,
our capital expenditure increased from €109.9 million in 2014 to €190.8 million in 2019, before decreasing to €105.5
million in 2020. We concluded a phase of heavy capital expenditure investment in 2016. From 2018 until March 2021,
we initiated a second phase of repositioning capital expenditure investments. Our adjusted operating cash flow (after
capital expenditure) increased from negative €77.8 million in 2014 to positive €37.2 million in 2016. This positive
operating cash flow (after capital expenditure) continued from 2017 to 2019 due to lower capital expenditure. The
successful completion of our investment program, together with renegotiations of our lease agreements to shift towards
variable leases, has enabled us to have a lighter asset structure, requiring less capital expenditure. Over the same period,
while maintaining substantially the same number of hotel rooms, our net turnover and Adjusted EBITDA have grown by
approximately 1.4x and 2.7x, respectively, or from €1,247.0 million and €119.5 million in 2014 to €1,708.1 million and
€319.4 million in 2019, respectively, demonstrating the increase of higher quality assets in our portfolio.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant cost control measures and developed a
contingency plan to reduce our costs. This achieved our aim of minimizing costs whilst hotels were closed, preserving
our liquidity to meet operational needs and ensuring that hotel activity could be resumed efficiently and under maximum
guarantees in terms of health and safety. Given the lack of visibility on the pace of business recovery, the cost control
measures were implemented, and continue to be implemented, to minimize operational expenses and preserve liquidity.

In the nine months from April to December 2020, we were able to minimize our cost base and reduce our nonrent costs by approximately 61% and our costs including rents by approximately 52%. Excluding perimeter changes, the
decrease in total rents amounted to approximately 32%, explained by the €63.6 million increase in our fixed rent
concessions and our lower variable rents. We were able to secure certain temporary reductions in fixed leases starting in
the second quarter of 2020 and negotiations with a view to reducing rents will continue into the first half of 2021. In
addition, since April 2020, our cost base has decreased due to a reduction in our staff and operating expenses by
approximately 60% and 62.5%, respectively. This was achieved by downsizes in our workforce by means of furloughs,
shorter working hours and wage cuts, which have extended through mid-2021. Additionally, all Group staff travel has
been suspended since early March 2020 and non-priority third party advisory services have also been suspended. We
have also significantly reduced our marketing and advertising spend. Furthermore, members of the board of directors of
the Issuer have foregone all their remuneration for the rest of 2021, while the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
operating performance persists. As a result of our effective cost control measures, we were able to offset approximately
50% of the EBITDA decline in 2020. We continued to implement cost control measures through the first quarter of 2021
and successfully offset approximately 69% of the EBITDA decline during such period. Overall, from April 2020 until
March 2021, we have been able to minimize our cost base and reduce our non-rent costs by approximately 60% and our
costs including rent by approximately 51%, compared to the same period in the prior year, allowing us to offset
approximately 54% of EBITDA decline in the twelve months ended March 31, 2021.

To further preserve cash flow, we withdrew our 2019 dividend proposal of €0.15 per share, which would have
involved an estimated payment of approximately €59 million in 2020 and reduced our capital expenditure investments by
approximately €100 million, an approximate 50% reduction from our original investment plan for 2020. We reduced our
capital expenditure to €14.9 million in the first quarter of 2021 from €34.0 million in the same period of the prior year,
representing reduction of approximately 56%, and plan to maintain limited capital expenditure through 2021. In the first
quarter of 2021, our average cash outflow was approximately €29 million per month (75.5% of operating cash flow and
24.5% of investing and financial cash flow), a reduction from our average cash outflow of approximately €42 million per
month (67.9% of operating cash flow and 32.1% of investing and financial cash flow) in the year ended December 31,
2020.

**_Proactive strengthening of our capital structure and liquidity position_**

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken several pro-active steps to mitigate its impact on our
financial position and to strengthen our capital structure. During this time, we have maintained liquidity through taking
advantage of our available financing. This includes drawing €250 million under the Senior Secured RCF in March 2020
and amending the Senior Secured RCF in October 2020, pursuant to which the existing lenders extended availability
from September 2021 to March 2023 and waived the financial covenants stipulated in the Senior Secured RCF agreement

12


-----

up to and including December 31, 2021, as well as a significant reduction to the levels required to be met until June 2022
(inclusive), with the next covenant testing at the original ratio levels not due until December 2022. We have since limited
repayments of the Senior Secured RCF to €14 million, leaving €236 million drawn as of March 31, 2021. Subject to
completion of the Offering, in June 2021, we again amended and extended the Senior Secured RCF until March 31, 2026
and an additional €6 million will be committed and the amount outstanding as of the Issue Date is expected to remain at
€236 million. In addition, in connection with the Offering, the lenders under the Senior Secured RCF have agreed to a
waiver of the financial covenants for the full year of 2022. The effectiveness of this waiver is conditional upon the
closing of the Offering on the Issue Date. See "Description of certain financing arrangements–Senior Secured RCF
_Agreement." We also drew €39 million under unsecured short-term bilateral credit facilities during 2020._

On April 29, 2020, we entered into a €225 million Term Facility Agreement, guaranteed up to 70% by the
,Instituto de Crédito Oficial (the "ICO"), which was fully drawn as of March 31, 2021. In addition, on May 18, 2020 we
also entered into a €25 million Sabadell Bilateral Facility Agreement also guaranteed by the ICO. To further mitigate the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in May 2021, we obtained a waiver of financial covenant testing until June 2022
(inclusive), as well as an extension of the maturity of these COVID Related ICO Facilities from 2023 to 2026. See
"Description of certain financing arrangements– Term Facility Agreement and Sabadell Bilateral Facility Agreement."
On May 12, 2021, we entered into the unsecured €100 million Shareholder Loan from our 94% shareholder, MINT.
Following the Offering, we intend to capitalize this debt (which we may do solely at our discretion) and carry out a
Rights Offering to minority shareholders at the same time. See "Description of certain financing arrangements–
_Subordinated Loans—Shareholder Loan."_

As of March 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our total net indebtedness
(excluding operating lease liabilities and the Shareholder Loan) would have amounted to €686.1 million, comprising
€1,051.0 million of indebtedness, less cash and cash equivalents of €364.9 million. Our total liquidity as of March 31,
2020, pro forma for the Transactions, would have been €395.9 million, including €31 million of available undrawn
amounts, which is comprised of €25 million available under bilateral credit lines and €6 million which will be made
available under the Senior Secured RCF. See "Capitalization." We have no significant debt maturities until 2023 (other
than €356.9 million attributable to the 2023 Notes, which are expected to be redeemed using the proceeds of the
Offering).

We also intend to continue our ongoing asset rotation strategy through sale and leasebacks during the second
and third quarters of 2021, with a focus on higher quality of assets, which we expect will generate net cash proceeds of
over €200 million to be applied towards enhancing liquidity and reducing debt.

In the past, we successfully reduced our net leverage from approximately 2.6x in 2017 to 0.6x in 2018 and 2019,
a reduction of approximately 200 basis points. We anticipate that our plans for ongoing debt optimization and liquidity
reinforcement, as described above, will provide stability and sustainability for the Group in the future.

**_Large, diversified and well-invested hotel portfolio in key urban locations_**

As of March 31, 2021, of the 355 hotels we operated, we owned 73, leased 229 and managed 53 hotels owned or
leased by third parties pursuant to management agreements. Most of our hotels are strategically located in key urban
markets (see "—We are a leading European hotel operator with a large and diversified hotel presence and a strongly
_recognized brand"). Our portfolio of 73 owned and operated hotels consists of 11,920 hotel rooms as of March 31, 2021,_
which represent approximately 22% of the rooms we operate. Our owned hotels are located in the Netherlands (23% of
book value), Italy (21% of book value), Spain (20% of book value), the United States (11% of book value), Belgium (8%
of book value), Germany (6% of book value), Argentina (5% of book value) and other countries (6% of book value). The
book value of our 73 owned hotels was €1.3 billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, although we believe
that the actual market value of such assets is higher, due to the fact that prices at which we have been able to sell our
assets in recent years have been typically higher than their respective book values. In addition, out of our 73 owned
hotels, 30 hotels have been appraised by third-parties between June 2020 and February 2021, and such hotels, which have
a book value of €593 million as of December 31, 2020, have been assigned a total market value of €875 million, meaning
that market value for those 30 appraised hotels exceeds their book value by approximately 48%.

In 2020, we completed our investment program which started in 2014, involving €371 million of repositioning
capital expenditure, €75 million of investment from the owners of our leased hotels, €60 million in basic capital
expenditure and €50 million of IT capital expenditure. Our ADR increased from €79 in 2014 to €103 in 2019. We also
improved RevPAR from €53.4 for the year ended December 31, 2014 to €73.5 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
We believe this positive result was attributable to the investment program, including the refurbishment of existing hotels
and the opening of new hotels. Our refurbished hotels have generally shown improved Occupancy, RevPAR and ADR.
We believe our refurbishment and repositioning program has also significantly contributed to improved TripAdvisor and
Google review rankings, showing increases in the levels of quality perceived by customers. In 2020, we continued our
repositioning program with an investment of approximately €50 million.

**_Experienced management team that have a track record of operational improvement and have adapted well during the_**
**_pandemic, and demonstrable support from MINT_**

Our experienced and proven management team has an average of approximately 17 years' experience in the
hotel industry. We believe this has been instrumental to our growth and has successfully transformed our business into an
international hotel chain, with strong footholds in European markets as well as exposure to markets in Latin America.

In January 2017, we appointed Ramón Aragonés Marín as our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), who we
believe has in-depth knowledge of the Group and the industry in which we operate, strategic vision as well as strong
leadership and team management capabilities. Mr. Aragonés Marín has approximately 43 years of experience in the hotel
industry and has worked at the Group for the last 12 years.

Our management team continues to be fully committed to the implementation of our business plan and will
continue to seek opportunities to increase profitability going forward. As a result of the successful implementation of
strategic initiatives by our management team, our Adjusted EBITDA increased from €120 million in the year ended
December 31, 2014 to €319 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.

The hospitality sector has faced unprecedented challenges in 2020 due to the severe impact of the COVID-19
pandemic. Our operating (EBITDA growth) and financial (deleveraging) transformation achieved in previous years
together with the comprehensive contingency measures implemented have allowed us to address the challenges of this
extraordinary complex year and safeguard business sustainability. In addition, our management team took decisive
actions during the pandemic, including cost control measures, through a reduction in our staff and operating expenses
through temporary downsizes in our workforce, reductions in hours and wages and successful negotiations with our
landlords for temporary rent reductions. The management team also withdrew our 2019 dividend proposal and reduced
our capital expenditure investments. These measures enabled us to offset approximately 50% of revenue decline at the
EBITDA level in 2020. Our management team continued our effective cost reduction measures through the first quarter
of 2021 and successfully offset 69% of the revenue decline. The management team also took a number of measures to
protect liquidity. For more information, see "—Robust cash flow generation following the completion of the investment
_program and significant action taken on costs and cash flow to mitigate the effects of the pandemic". In addition,_
members of the board of directors of the Company have suspended their remuneration for 2021.

We also benefit from the industry knowledge and support of our controlling shareholder, MINT, which operates
over 172 hotels and resorts across Asia, Australia, Africa, the Middle East and South America. For more information, see
"Shareholders." MINT has demonstrated its financial support by granting a Shareholder Loan of €100 million to the
Company in May 2021. This is intended to enhance our liquidity and further strengthen our capital structure so that we
can address the challenges arising from the current industry environment from a stable financial position.

**Our strategy**

**_Position the hotel portfolio as best as possible to take advantage of the recovery in the tourism and travel industry_**

We will continue to position our business as a leading international hotel operator to take advantage of the
recovery in the tourism and travel industry and capture expected short term business-to-customer and leisure demand.
The vast majority of our sales (93%) are from Europe where vaccination programs are accelerating and countries are now
emerging from lockdowns and travel restrictions. We are planning to take advantage of our strong positioning in each of
the European countries in which we operate and focus on the business-to-customer segment that represents
approximately 60-70% of business. To capture the short term demand, we plan to implement a strategic promotions plan
to secure short term business-to-customer and leisure demand.

We are well positioned to take advantage of favorable economic and travel trends in our various local markets,
supported by a high contribution of revenue from domestic demand, which was 67% in Germany, 60% in Spain, 48% in
Italy and 47% in the Netherlands based on 2019 total revenue figures. Overall, intra-European demand represented
between 71-76% of our revenues in 2019.

As a result of our flexible operating structure, we are competitively positioned to take advantage of increasing
tourism and travel demand in Europe and to maintain a progressive re-opening strategy that focuses on optimizing
profitability. We are focused on enhancing and recovering our brand standards of quality and experience, demonstrated
by our notable customer service and amenities, by implementing initiatives that cater to the needs of the business
traveler. We will redesign our approach to the corporate segment through new value proposition and account handling
model, focusing on unmanaged business. Although we expect leisure customers to return more quickly than business
travelers, we do have initiatives in place to entice business travelers. We will continue with the full roll-out of initiatives
to adapt to the new trends of business traveler including extended stays, large workspaces, and set ups for virtual
meetings. We offer "Smart Spaces," exclusive spaces for customers to work and organize small business meetings to take
advantage of all of the hotel's amenities. In addition, we offer hybrid meetings to enhance the value of events for our

14


-----

business travelers, combining in-person and virtual attendees and reaching a greater audience from different destinations .
Through initiatives like these, we believe we are able to enhance our brand reputation and maintain our status as a top
hotel choice by travelers. For more information on our business initiatives, see "Business— Sustainability and
_Environmental, health and safety matters —Sustainability initiatives" and "Management's discussion and analysis of_
_financial condition and results of operations—The COVID-19 pandemic and related measures"._

In 2020, as part of our "feel safe" program, a best in class health and safety measure and SGS protocol, we have
implemented enhanced cleaning and disinfection protocols, food and beverage management protocols, social distancing
rules and air and water purification control, as well as new digital solutions. This new program, which was adopted as
part of our COVID-19 recovery strategy, comprises a set of health and safety protocols aimed at safeguarding health and
safety and allowing social distancing for both guests and employees. We reviewed all our procedures and made nearly
700 adaptations to our operating standards to preserve the health and safety of guests and employees worldwide. Grouped
into 10 main lines of action and supported by specialists in various fields, the measures implemented include the
digitization of hotel services and adapting sanitation processes, including social distancing regulations in operations and
the use of personal protective equipment, among others. We also reached a collaboration agreement with SGS, the world
leader in inspection, analysis and certification, which allows us to follow up on the measurement and diagnostics protocol
established to verify that our hotels are clean and safe environments. Due to the involvement of hotel managers and heads
of department, this plan progressed and we are committed to ensuring that employees adopt, follow and implement the
new health and safety standards at all our hotels and across operations. We have pursued a progressive and flexible
reopening of our hotels since June 2020.

**_Continue optimizing the portfolio in the mid-term_**

In connection with our repositioning initiative which started in 2014, we have invested approximately €371
million of repositioning capital expenditure between 2014 when the plan was launched and 2020. This initiative is now
completed and, as of December 31, 2020, a total of 107 hotels have been refurbished, representing approximately 30% of
our hotel portfolio. These hotels were selected as we believed they were the most likely to yield higher Occupancy and
ADR and to enhance the value of our owned and long term leased assets. Our refurbishment program involved
modernizing rooms and common areas by refreshing paint and floor coverings and replacing furnishings and finishings.
In certain hotels, we undertook the refurbishment of the entire building, including all mechanical, electrical and plumbing
systems. The hotels we have refurbished have generally experienced increased RevPAR as it can be extracted from the
Group RevPAR growth from €53 in 2014 to €74 in 2019 and the value of our hotels has typically increased as a result of
refurbishment. Although we have undertaken a capital-intensive refurbishment program, we have staggered the costs
over several years, and we therefore have the flexibility to substantially control or reduce such costs by restructuring our
refurbishment program as required.

In an effort to optimize our lease portfolio, we intend to implement selective refurbishments of certain hotels,
identifying attractive repositioning and investment opportunities to implement once the pandemic subsides, and to
renegotiate contracts (increase variable terms), extensions and terminations. We also intend to increase the number of
managed hotels we operate by utilizing our strong recognition as a hotel operator and our strong market positioning
ahead of potential movements in the sector. In Europe, we believe we have an opportunity increase our luxury segment
positioning through the Anantara Brand with an additional Anantara marketing campaign expected in the year, as well as
in the Resort segment where we have a strong presence, proven track record and high brand awareness, in particular in
our core geographies of Spain, Portugal and Italy (see "—Our strengths—We are a leading European hotel operator with
_a large and diversified hotel presence and a strongly recognized brand")._

**_Focus on digitalization, our loyalty program and pricing and sales channels to drive improvements in profitability_**

A key focus of the Group is to continue to be at the forefront of innovation, with an emphasis on digitalization,
which we believe will further improve our profitability. In recent years, our digital transformation has improved the
efficiency of our processes and systems, with a key achievement being the centralization of all of our properties and
functions onto a single integrated system. This fully-integrated digital platform (the "NH Digital Core Platform") is a
pioneering technological solution in the sector that has become the basis for us to expand our customer knowledge,
maximize efficiency and innovate on a large scale in all our value areas.

In 2019, we launched "Fastpass", a combination of three innovative services (Check-in Online, Choose Your
Room and Check-out Online), which gives customers full control over their stay. We believe we are the first urban hotel
chain in Europe to offer such services on mobile devices. This initiative also allows for quality and experience
enhancement by improving contactless and seamless transactions through the optimization of online check in/out
processes. In addition, in 2019, we also launched "City Connection", under the slogan "Stay in one hotel, enjoy them all",
whereby we offer our customers the convenience and added benefit to access and enjoy selective amenities at any of our
hotels in their destination city.

15


-----

We are in the process of migrating our loyalty program from NH Rewards to Global Hotel Alliance ("GHA"),
increasing the visibility of our loyalty program and strengthening our guest database, with a view to making the Group
more competitive. GHA is the operator of an award-winning, multi-brand hotel loyalty program ("DISCOVERY"), and in
April 2021 we announced that the Group would join the alliance and merge the NH Rewards Loyalty Program with
DISCOVERY in early 2022. As one of the ten largest loyalty programs in the hospitality sector, with over 900
participating hotels, the DISCOVERY program allows the Group to utilize collective buying power and collaborative
marketing efforts, and opens up destinations across Asia, Australia and North America to our customers. GHA is
preparing to launch a redesigned version of its DISCOVERY program during the fourth quarter of 2021, which will
include a digital rewards currency and unique benefits and offers for local members. The migration to GHA will allow
the Company to benefit from a major global program with access to key feeder markets.

We plan to continue to optimize our pricing and revenue management strategy through additional technology
investments to push for automation.

**_Enhance operational excellence by additional efficiencies in fixed costs with a continuous optimization of our support_**
**_functions, including through digitalization_**

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a contingency plan to unlock structural cost savings
and adapt our operations, including reductions, concessions or deferrals of fixed rent expenses, early termination of
underperforming leases, certain headcount rationalizations, the negotiation of lower procurement costs with our
suppliers, the reduction and cancellation of certain capital expenditures and suspension of all staff travel and non-priority
advisory, marketing and advertising costs. In addition, we implemented a collective dismissal process at our central and
corporate services at the end of April 2021. We intend to maintain certain of these cost efficiencies after the pandemic
into 2022. In addition to the cost control measures taken in response to COVID-19, we are committed to increasing the
digitalization of hotel information and services. Our digital transformation has resulted in more efficient and improved
systems and processes, which we believe leads to further differentiation from our competition. The introduction of the
NH Digital Core Platform has allowed us to centralize all our properties and functions onto a single integrated system.
This is a pioneering technological solution in the sector that has allowed us to expand our customer knowledge,
maximize efficiency and innovate on a larger scale in all our value areas. In addition, we have utilized an advanced
online application, which can be accessed by any guest from their mobile device. The application provides all customers
with all the hotel information in an easily-accessible format, from information on the hotel's facilities and hours, to
ordering room service, making a reservation in the restaurant or requesting additional amenities. We have also
implemented additional initiatives, such as a housekeeping mobility application, tablets at the reception desks and
digitalization of reports, which optimizes our hotel managers' record of customers and supervision processes.

**_Focus on talent management and return to a "new normal"_**

Throughout 2020 and into 2021, we have taken measures to alleviate the significant impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on our business and profits. With this aim, and always with the purpose of protecting employment in the long
term as much as possible, we launched a contingency plan to temporarily reduce our staff and, as a result, adjust
personnel costs to the new reality of the business, with contract suspensions, reductions in working days, hours and
wages and other temporary measures taken in accordance with employment legislation in each country. Even in such an
adverse context, we strive to maintain our corporate culture and commitment to our values, seeking coherence and
fidelity in our strategy with respect to our people, as a key factor in retaining the credibility and trust of our teams.

The initial aim at the beginning of 2020 was to consolidate key policies and projects within the Group's Human
Resources Strategic Plan; however all planned projects were put on hold due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Throughout the year, we still maintained a focus on our strategic pillars, but with each action and initiative re-evaluated
in the context of the complicated individual, social and corporate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic:

      - _Global leadership and talent management: We continue to promote leadership within the Group,_
focusing efforts and investment on internal talent that has the potential to make a difference in the
Group's strategy and to become models of our culture.

      - _Maximum performance and better workplaces: All employees are encouraged to develop and fulfil_
their potential, with high performance differentiated, recognized and rewarded, enabling them to
become our best brand ambassadors.

      - _Transformation and reinvention: We continually search for, assess and utilize opportunities to be more_
efficient (for example, outsourcing and digitization), evolving our working environment and acquiring
advanced analytical and predictive skills.

Within this working framework, we launched a multitude of initiatives to care for our employees during these
challenging times. For example, "With You" is an internal engagement project designed to give our teams tools, advice

16


-----

and training resources to strengthen key skills during this phase, not just at the professional level but also to improve their
personal well-being. Using "With You", among other actions, employees have received content aimed at stress
management, accessed digital kiosks free-of-charge, had language classes within reach, been able to collect office
material to improve their remote working experience and had access to two external, international e-learning platforms
("Typsy" and "GoodHabitz"). Both platforms include multiple training resources so that each employee can work on their
personal development plan, gain new knowledge and, ultimately, continue investing in their professional growth. Our
"Room4People" program supports professional development and creates social projects in the communities in which we
operate, by promoting equal opportunities for employees and investing in career training and career support for young
people who are in an under-privileged situation. This is based on the premise of sustainable and ethical principles,
responsible culture and spirit of citizenship.

During 2020, we employed an average of 11,112 employees. Our corporate culture is based on the cornerstones
of diversity, equality and inclusion. Employees comprise 132 different nationalities and, as of December 31, 2020, 51%
of all staff were women. As a demonstration of our continuing commitment to gender equality, the Group, for the second
year running, was included on the Bloomberg GEI 2021 index, making us the only Spanish hotelier in the 380 companies
listed in the index. We pride ourselves on running a company that values our employees and creates a culture where
employees wish to continue working for a long time. The average age of employees in 2020 was 39.7 years old and their
average time with the Group is 9.4 years.

**_Best in class positioning on sustainability with continuous focus on areas of improvement_**

We are committed to improving the sustainability of our business operations, ensuring a safe and inclusive
working environment and respecting the communities in which we operate. We seek to safeguard natural resources by
reducing the impact of our operations on the environment. We believe that sustainable business practices can foster a
sense of community beyond our organization, reflecting a duty of care for the world and generating wealth for society.
To that end, we have developed our strategic approach to sustainability, known as "NH ROOM4 Sustainable Business,"
with three lines of action: NH ROOM4People; NH ROOM4Planet; and NH ROOM4 Responsible Shared Success, all of
which are based on the same premise of sustainable and ethical principles, responsible culture and a citizenship mindset:

      - Under NH ROOM4People, we promote internal professional development and create social projects in
the communities where we are present. We defend diversity and equal opportunities for our employees
and we invest in training and career support for our young employees to promote employee
engagement and growth. We also encourage volunteer work by our employees and take various
initiatives to contribute to a positive impact on local communities where we operate such as "Hotels
with a heart", where we provide accommodation for hospitalized children and their families;

      - Under NH ROOM4Planet, we commit to the environment, including responsible water management
and increasing our use of "green" energy sources, sustainable products consumption and taking action
to address climate change. We have formalized our commitment to cut our impact on the environment
by announcing our initiative to reduce carbon emissions by 20% by 2030. In December 2020, we
scored a B rating with the Carbon Disclosure Project, recognizing our efforts in the battle against
climate change. We are continually working towards reduced emissions by increasing green energy
with onsite facilities, renewable energy sources, and water optimization. We are working closely with
our suppliers to create opportunities for sustainability to benefit everyone in the circular economy.

      - Under NH ROOM4 Responsible Shared Success, we convey human rights and ethical business
principles throughout our responsible value chain. We work directly with suppliers to develop
innovative and sustainable solutions and apply certain social and environmental criteria in selecting
partners. We also seek to include and engage our customers in our sustainable initiatives, whether by
generating opportunities to contribute socially or by promoting environmentally responsible behavior.
In particular, we have launched our "Green Stay" initiative which allows customers on extended stays
to decline room cleaning services, contributing to savings in water, energy and other resources.

As the result of our commitment to sustainability, we were awarded "Bronze Class" recognition in the
Sustainability Yearbook 2021, which is published by S&P Global, as well as recognized as an "Industry Mover" due to
the significant improvements achieved since the previous year. In addition, since 2013, we have been included in the
FTSE4GOOD Index due to our management of the business. For more details on our sustainability initiatives, see,
"Business―Sustainability and Environmental, health and safety matters―Sustainability initiatives".

**Recent developments**

**_Trading and Operational Update_**

Based on our results, consolidated RevPAR for the month ended April 30, 2021 is €11.4, representing a
significant increase compared to €0.4 for the month ended April 30, 2020, which is primarily explained by the strict
lockdown measures that were in effect in April 2020. Consolidated Occupancy and ADR for the month ended April 30,
2021 is 16.6% and €68.8, respectively, compared to 1.1% and €33.3 for the month ended April 30, 2020. Since the
beginning of May, some European governments have begun to gradually ease lockdown measures. As a result, at the end
of May 2021, 276 of our hotels were open, representing 78% of our portfolio. We plan to continue to reopen our hotels as
European governments continue to ease lockdown measures. By the end of June, we estimate that 92% of our portfolio
will be open.

The following chart sets forth our number of open hotels by month between April 2020 and May 2021.

The month of May indicates a change in trend in the number of hotels open with immediate short-term demand
and weekly room revenue significantly increasing in the last weeks of the month. Spain and Italy have been the first
countries easing lockdown measures, while Germany and Benelux are expected to follow suit in mid-June. In these
countries where restrictions have been lifted, demand has immediately increased. As such, Occupancy of European open
hotels increased from 23% in April to 30% in May 2021. In the last weeks of the month of May, Occupancy remained
between 30% and 35%. We believe that these increases in Occupancy in April and May 2021 as compared to the same
months in 2020, and the increases in RevPAR in April 2021 as compared to April 2020 as described above, are mainly
due to the recent relaxation of strict restrictions (lockdowns, temporary hotel closures and travel restrictions) that were in
place in April and May 2020. While similar restrictive measures also applied at the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021,
such measures have started to be eased, particularly in April and May 2021. The recovery in domestic leisure demand is
already noticeable and is gaining momentum, as countries in Europe gradually increase their vaccination rates,
consumers gain confidence and governments continue to ease restrictions. We believe that the difficulties experienced in
2020 and in early 2021 are behind us and that a gradual recovery will soon begin.

The following charts set forth Occupancy at our European open hotels and weekly occupancy trends at our
European open owned and leased hotels between April 2020 and May 2021.

While we believe that the most challenging periods have passed and certain countries appear to have improved
slightly during the last two months, our visibility remains very low. We foresee a recovery where RevPAR and
Occupancy may increase gradually month by month, with the percentage of hotels open following the same pace. Due to
the complexity of the pandemic, until travel restrictions are eased, we do not expect to see a material improvement in
results in the short term. The uncertainty regarding the severity, duration and economic consequences of the COVID-19
pandemic requires the continued implementation of cost-control measures to protect our business, with a downsized
workforce by means of temporary and permanent lay-offs, shorter working hours and wage reductions. As an example, at
the end of April 2021, we implemented a collective dismissal procedure at our central and corporate services in Spain,
following negotiations with employee representatives. As a result of this procedure, we estimate that we will realize
approximately €20 million of annual cost savings. In addition, we have implemented additional cost saving measures,
which we estimate will result in approximately €15 million of annual cost savings, which are mainly attributable to cost
savings in connection with hotel operations (such as a payroll reduction in our food and beverage, M&E and
housekeeping departments to adapt to a more flexible cost structure at hotels across all BUs) . Furthermore, we are
continuing to negotiate reductions to our fixed rent expenses with our landlords, with a view to seeking to obtain further
rent reductions or deferrals.

**_Asset Rotation through Sale and Leaseback Transactions_**

The Board of Directors of the Issuer has approved the continuation of its policy regarding selective asset
rotation through sale and lease-back transactions which the Issuer estimates will allow an inflow of net proceeds of
approximately €200 million between the second and third quarters of 2021.

For example, the Issuer is in advanced negotiations for the sale of the NH Collection Barcelona Gran Hotel
Calderón for approximately €125 million, under a sale and leaseback structure, with the Issuer maintaining operation of
the hotel on a long-term basis through the payment of variable rent (with a minimum guarantee), which will also include
the mechanisms for limiting our exposure to losses, such as a cap on shortfalls.

**_Financial Covenant Waivers and Extensions of Maturity of Certain Credit Facilities_**

_Financial covenant waivers_

The Issuer and the relevant lenders have agreed a waiver of the financial covenants set forth in the COVID
Related ICO Facilities up to and including June 30, 2022, with the result that compliance will not be tested until
December 31, 2022.

Additionally, the Issuer and the lenders under the Senior Secured RCF have agreed a waiver of the financial
covenants set forth in the Senior Secured RCF Agreement up to and including December 31, 2021, as well as a

significant reduction to the levels required to be met up to and including June 30, 2022, with the result that the ratios
required to be met will be returned to their original levels starting on December 31, 2022. In addition, in connection with
the Offering, the lenders under the Senior Secured RCF have agreed to a waiver of the financial covenants for the full
year of 2022. The effectiveness of this waiver is conditional upon the closing of the Offering on the Issue Date.

_Extensions of the maturity_

The Issuer and the relevant lenders have agreed an extension of the term of the COVID Related ICO Facilities
which are guaranteed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation under the line of guarantees
managed by the Official Credit Institute (Instituto de Crédito Oficial or "ICO"), from April 29, 2023 to April 29, 2026.

In addition, in connection with the Offering, the lenders under the Senior Secured RCF have agreed an extension
of the term of the Senior Secured RCF from March 31, 2023 to March 31, 2026. The effectiveness of this extension is
conditional upon the closing of the Offering on the Issue Date.

**_Shareholder Loan and Rights Offering addressed to Minority Shareholders_**

On May 12, 2021, the Issuer, as borrower, and MHG Continental Holding (Singapore) Pte Ltd., as lender,
entered into a subordinated convertible term loan facility agreement for an amount of €100,000,000 (the "Shareholder
_Loan"). For a detailed description of the Shareholder Loan, see "Description of certain financing arrangements". The_
Issuer intends to capitalize the Shareholder Loan in the short term and has submitted to the next Ordinary General
Shareholders' Meeting to be held on June 30, 2021 a resolution concerning the proposal to increase the Issuer's share
capital by an effective amount equivalent to the principal amount of the Shareholder Loan plus interest accrued until the
date of capitalization by way of set-off of the amounts owed under the Shareholder Loan and to authorize the Board of
Directors, which includes members of MINT, to set the date, the issue price per share and further conditions thereof.
Likewise, in order to offer the Company's minority shareholders the possibility to maintain their stake and avoid any
dilution due to the capitalization of the Shareholder Loan, the Board of Directors of the Company plans to adopt, at the
time of the capitalization of the Shareholder Loan and in exercise of the delegation of powers in favor of the Board of
Directors to increase the share capital approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting of the Company held on May 13,
2019, a corporate resolution to increase the share capital of the Issuer by way of cash contributions in the amount
necessary to avoid any such dilution with allocation of pre-emptive subscription rights addressed exclusively to the
Issuer's shareholders other than MINT (the "Rights Offering"), by virtue of which new shares will be issued to
shareholders who exercise their pre-emptive subscription rights at the same issue price at which MHG Continental
Holding (Singapore) Pte Ltd. will capitalize the Shareholder Loan (the "Rights Issuance").

**The Refinancing**

We intend to use the gross proceeds from the Offering:

    - to redeem in full the 2023 Notes;

    - to pay the redemption premium on the 2023 Notes;

    - to pay the costs, fees and expenses in connection with the Refinancing; and

    - for general corporate purposes.

See "Use of proceeds", "Capitalization" and "Description of certain financing arrangements" for a more
detailed description of the Refinancing.

**Valuation of our portfolio**

**_Valuation of the Collateral_**

Duff & Phelps has carried out a market valuation as of December 31, 2020 of the Mortgage Properties and the
Share Collateral, including the total equity value of NH Italia. Duff & Phelps' valuation of the NH Italia Shares deducts
total financial liabilities (excluding lease liabilities) of NH Italia, which were €38.8 million as of December 31, 2020 (the
date of valuation in the Duff & Phelps Report). Based on the Duff & Phelps Report, the aggregate market value of the
Mortgage Properties and the Share Collateral as of December 31, 2020 was €1,319.0 million. During this same period,
our unencumbered asset portfolio had a book value of €0.6 billion.

(1) According to the Duff & Phelps Report, as of December 31, 2020, the market value of the NH Italia Shares was
€936.0 million. The Duff & Phelps' valuation of the NH Italia Shares deducts total financial liabilities of NH
Italia, which were €38.8 million as of December 31, 2020. As the projections include rent expenses, lease
liabilities are excluded from total financial liabilities.

After giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, as of March 31, 2021, an aggregate amount of €636.0 million
of our outstanding indebtedness would have been secured by the Collateral, of which €400.0 million would have
consisted of indebtedness under the Notes.

As of the Issue Date, the Collateral will secure the Notes and Senior Secured RCF (expected to remain drawn in
an amount of €236.0 million on such date) on a pari passu basis, as described under "Description of certain financing
_arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement"._

**_Basis of valuation and assumptions_**

The valuation by Duff & Phelps was prepared on the basis of certain qualifications, assumptions, estimates and
projections. In particular, the valuation is based upon certain assumptions regarding recovery from the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic, and the future impact of the pandemic on our business is difficult to predict. See “Risk
_factors―Risks relating to our business and industry―The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on_
_our industry and business, and may continue to have a significant negative impact in the future.” The proceeds of any_
sale of the Collateral may vary significantly from the valuation set forth in the Duff & Phelps Report. For further
information, see "Business—Valuation of the Collateral". See also "Risk factors—Risks relating to our business and
_industry—The value of our properties reflected on our balance sheet and in this Offering Memorandum and the book_
_value of our hotels and assets included in this Offering Memorandum is based in part upon the results of third-party_
_valuations, and because property and asset valuation is inherently subjective and uncertain, the projections or_
_assumptions used, estimates made or procedures followed in the third-party valuation of our properties and assets may_
_not be correct, accurate or complete and may suffer severe devaluations due to the COVID-19 pandemic" and "Risk_
_factors—Risks relating to the Notes and our structure—The projections or assumptions used, estimates made or_
_procedures followed in the Duff & Phelps Report for the valuation of the Collateral may not be correct, accurate or_
_complete, and investors in the Notes will have no recourse against the third-party property valuation provider"._

**_Valuation of our owned hotels_**

Our 73 owned hotels had a book value of €1.3 billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, although

21


-----

we believe that the actual market value of such assets is higher, due to the fact that prices at which we have been able to
sell our assets in recent years have been typically higher than their respective book values. Between June 2020 and
February 2021, 30 owned hotels were appraised by third parties and were assigned a market value of approximately
€875 million, while their book value as of December 31, 2020 is recorded as approximately €593 million. This means
that the market value for those 30 appraised hotels exceeds their book value by approximately 48%.

**The Issuer**

The Issuer is a public limited company (sociedad anónima) incorporated under the laws of Spain and listed on
the Barcelona, Bilbao, Madrid and Valencia Stock Exchanges (the "Spanish Stock Exchanges") with an authorized share
capital of €784,360,486.00, consisting of 392,180,243 shares as of March 31, 2021. All shares have been issued and are
fully paid up. Our market capitalization was €1.6 billion as of June 11, 2021. The Issuer is registered in the Commercial
Registry of Madrid at volume 576 general 176 of section 3 of the companies' registry, page 61, sheet M-61 443. The
registered office of the Issuer is located at Calle Santa Engracia 120, 28003 Madrid, Spain and its telephone number at
that address is (+34) 91 451 97 18.

**Summary corporate and financing structure**

_The following diagram summarizes our corporate structure, as well as the principal financing arrangements of_
_the Group, after giving effect to the Refinancing. For a summary of the debt obligations referenced in this diagram, see_
_"Description of certain financing arrangements" and "Description of the Notes"._

(1) The Issuer is listed on the Spanish Stock Exchanges with an authorized share capital of €784,360,486.00, consisting
of 392,180,243 shares as of March 31, 2021. See "Shareholders" for information about our shareholders.

(2) As of the Issue Date, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured, subject to certain agreed security
principles, by the Collateral on a first-ranking basis, other than the security interests over the NH Italia Shares,
which shall be granted on a second-ranking basis but shall be deemed and treated as first-ranking security interests
under the Intercreditor Agreement. For a description of the Collateral, see "Description of the Notes—Security". As
of the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by the same Collateral as the Senior Secured RCF, and will benefit from
the proceeds of enforcement of such Collateral on a pro rata and pari passu basis with the Senior Secured RCF, as
described under "Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement". After giving pro forma
effect to the Transactions, as of March 31, 2021, assuming €236 million of the Senior Secured RCF will remain
drawn on the Issue Date, an aggregate amount of €636.0 million of our indebtedness outstanding would have been
secured by the Collateral, of which €400.0 million would have comprised indebtedness under the Notes.

(3) As of the Issue Date, the Senior Secured RCF is secured by the same Collateral as will secure the Notes and will
benefit from the proceeds of enforcement of such Collateral on a pro rata and pari passu basis with the Notes, as
described under "Description of the Notes" and "Description of certain financing arrangements—Senior Secured
_RCF Agreement"._

(4) Certain of the Issuer's subsidiaries will unconditionally guarantee the Notes. For a list of these subsidiaries, see "—
_The offering—Notes Guarantees". The Guarantors also guarantee the Senior Secured RCF and the COVID Related_
ICO Facilities. The Guarantors comprised 68.6% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020 and represented 84.4%
and 73.9% of our net turnover and EBITDA, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the Issuer
and the Guarantors together comprised 80.5% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020 and represented 86.6%
and 83.6% of our net turnover and EBITDA, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of March 31,
2021, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, the Issuer would have had €955.5 million of indebtedness
outstanding and the Guarantors would have had €66.7 million of indebtedness outstanding, of which €42.6 million
was drawn under the New York Capex Term Facility. See "Description of certain financing arrangements—Other
_unsecured loans"._

(5) As of March 31, 2021, our subsidiaries that are not Guarantors would have had indebtedness outstanding in an
aggregate amount of €28.8 million.

(6) Represents the Shareholder Loan from MINT of €100.0 million which is expected to be capitalized in the shortterm into share capital of the Issuer. Concurrently with the capitalization, the Issuer intends to address a Rights
Offering to all shareholders (other than MINT) to enable such shareholders to avoid dilution of their shareholding.
See "Description of certain financing arrangements—Subordinated loans—Shareholder Loan".

(7) Represents the Term Facility Agreement of €225.0 million, which was fully drawn as of March 31, 2021, and the
Sabadell Bilateral Facility Agreement of €25.0 million, which was fully drawn as of March 31, 2021. See

All Notes Guarantees will be granted on the Issue Date.

The Guarantors comprised 68.6% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020 and

not guarantee the Notes had €28.8 million of debt outstanding. The Notes
Guarantees will be subject to legal and contractual limitations. For instance, due
to Italian laws on corporate benefit, the guarantee provided by NH Italia will be
limited to €90 million. See "Risk factors—Risks relating to the Notes and our
_structure—The Notes Guarantees are significantly limited by applicable laws and_
_are subject to certain limitations on enforcement or defenses and security_
_interests in the Collateral" and "Limitations on validity and enforceability of the_
_Notes Guarantees and the security interests and certain insolvency law_
_considerations"._

The Notes Guarantees may be released in certain circumstances. See

_Risks relating to the Notes and our structure—The Notes Guarantees and the_
_security interests in the Collateral are significantly limited by applicable laws_

the Senior Secured RCF as described under "—Security";

                      - rank pari passu in right of payment with existing and future obligations of
the applicable Guarantor that are not subordinated to such Guarantor's Notes

Guarantee;

                      - be structurally subordinated to existing and future obligations of such
Guarantor's subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes; and

                      - be effectively subordinated to existing and future obligations of the
applicable Guarantor that are secured by assets that do not secure the Notes
Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such
obligations.

                      - a lien over the shares of capital stock representing 100% of the share capital
of (1) each of the Diegem Entities, (2) Zandvoort and (3) NH Italia, in the

The Indenture will provide that the Collateral will secure the Notes and the Notes
Guarantees. Security over the Collateral may be released under certain
circumstances, including if a certain loan to value ratio is satisfied and in
connection with certain permitted sales of the Collateral. See "Description of the
_Notes—Security—Release of Security Interests"._

The Collateral will also secure on a first-ranking basis the Senior Secured RCF
and may also secure certain future indebtedness. Pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from
enforcement of security over the Collateral on a pro rata and pari passu basis
with the lenders under the Senior Secured RCF, as described under "Description
_of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement"._

**Use of proceeds .............................. We intend to use the gross proceeds from the Offering:**

                      - to redeem in full the 2023 Notes;

                      - to pay redemption premium on the 2023 Notes;

                      - to pay the costs, fees and expenses in connection with the Refinancing; and

                      - for general corporate purposes.

**Optional redemption ..................... Prior to          , 2023, the Issuer may redeem at its option all or part of the**

Notes at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes
redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date and a
"make-whole" premium, as further described in this Offering Memorandum
under the caption "Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption".

In addition, at any time prior to          , 2023, the Issuer may redeem at its
option up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net
proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to      % of
the principal amount outstanding of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to
the redemption date, so long as at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of
the Notes remains outstanding immediately after each such redemption and each
such redemption occurs within 90 days after the closing date of the relevant
equity offering.

Prior to          , 2023, the Issuer may redeem during each twelve-month
period commencing with the Issue Date up to 10% of the original principal
amount of the Notes at its option, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days'
notice to Holders of the Notes, at a redemption price equal to 103% of the
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the applicable
redemption date.

whole or in part at the redemption prices described in this Offering Memorandum
under the caption "Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption", plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.

**Additional amounts; tax** All payments in respect of the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be made

**redemption .................................** without withholding or deduction for any taxes or other governmental charges,

except to the extent required by law. If withholding or deduction is required by
law, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer or Guarantors, as applicable, will
pay additional amounts so that the net amount a holder of such Notes receives is
no less than that which such holder would have received in the absence of such
withholding or deduction. See "Description of the Notes ". The Issuer may
redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, upon giving prior notice,
if certain changes in tax law, regulations or application or official interpretation
of such laws and regulations impose certain withholding taxes on amounts
payable on such Notes and, as a result, the Issuer or any Guarantor is required to
pay additional amounts with respect to such withholding taxes. If the Issuer
decides to exercise such redemption right, it must pay holders of such Notes a
redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed,
together with accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the
redemption date. See "Description of the Notes—Optional Tax Redemption".

**Change of control .......................... Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the Issuer**

is required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash
equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of repurchase plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
repurchase. See "Description of the Notes—Change of Control".

**Summary financial and other information**

_The following summary consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated_
_statement of financial position and consolidated statement of cash flows (1) as of and for the years ended December 31,_
_2018, 2019 and 2020, except for the footnotes included below each table and except as otherwise indicated, have been_
_derived from the audited consolidated financial statements for such periods of the Group, which were audited by_
_Deloitte, S.L. as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 and by PricewaterhouseCoopers Auditores, S.L. as of and_
_for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, and (2) as of March_
_31, 2021 and for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 have been derived from the unaudited condensed_
_interim consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2021, which were_
_subject to limited review by PricewaterhouseCoopers Auditores, S.L. and have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34._
_This summary financial information is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future period or_
_our financial condition at any future date._

_The financial information presented for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 is prepared by adding the_
_results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to the results of operations for the year ended_
_December 31, 2020 and subtracting the results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2020._

_IFRS 16 came into force on January 1, 2019, replacing IAS 17. Our financial statements as of and for the year_
_ended December 31, 2019 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS 16. The Group decided to apply the modified_
_retrospective method, as described in Note 2.1.1 of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31,_
_2019. Our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 have consequently not been restated._
_According to IFRS 16, upon entry into a lease, a liability in an amount equal to the present value of the lease instalments,_
_as well as an asset representing the right-of-use of the underlying asset during the lease term, must be recognized on the_
_balance sheet. The liability includes fixed instalments and those that are in substance fixed installments, as well as_
_variable instalments depending on an index or interest rate._

_In accordance with IFRS 5—Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, as described in_
_Note 12 of our financial statements as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, certain non-_
_strategic assets and liabilities undergoing divestment with committed sales plans were reclassified as "Non Current_
_Assets and Liabilities Classified as Held for Sale" in the consolidated balance sheet and as "Profits (Loss) for the Year_
_from Discontinued Operations Net of Tax" in the comprehensive consolidated income statement. The contribution of such_
_assets and liabilities was accordingly excluded from all other line items in the comprehensive consolidated income_
_statement and consolidated balance sheet. As described in Note 16 of our financial statements as of and for the year_
_ended December 31, 2020, the Group decided to reclassify as continuing operations certain assets which had been_
_classified as discontinued operations in the prior year._

_According to IAS 29, Argentina became a hyperinflationary economy during 2018 and our financial statements_
_as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 onwards have been prepared applying this standard. Relatedly, our_
_financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 recorded a higher consolidated result derived from_
_hyperinflation at our Argentine subsidiaries, when such recording should have been made directly in reserves for net tax._
_Our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 were not restated to reclassify such amount;_
_however, such amount was reclassified from profit or loss to equity in the comparative figures for 2018, which are_
_included in our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, as described in Note 2.2 of our_
_financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019._

_The following summary unaudited pro forma financial information has been derived by applying pro forma_
_adjustments to certain of the Group's historical consolidated financial information. The summary unaudited pro forma_
_financial information gives effect to the Refinancing as described in "Use of proceeds", as though it had occurred on_
_April 1, 2020 for pro forma financial information relating to statement of comprehensive income and on March 31, 2021_
_for pro forma financial information relating to statement of financial position. The unaudited pro forma adjustments and_
_the unaudited pro forma financial information set forth below are based upon available information and certain_
_assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and may differ from actual amounts. The summary pro forma_
_financial information is for informational purposes only and does not purport to present what our results would actually_
_have been had these transactions occurred on the dates presented or to project our results of operations or financial_
_position for any future period or our financial condition at any future date._

_This "Summary financial and other information" contains certain non-IFRS financial measures including_
_EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, pro forma net indebtedness, pro forma net_
_indebtedness secured by the Collateral and changes in working capital. These non-IFRS financial measures are not_
_measurements of performance or liquidity under IFRS. Investors should not place any undue reliance on these non-IFRS_
_measures and should not consider these measures as: (a) an alternative to operating income or net income as determined_
_in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or as measures of operating performance; (b) an_

30


-----

_alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, as determined in accordance with generally_
_accepted accounting principles, or as a measure of our ability to meet cash needs; or (c) an alternative to any other_
_measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles. These measures are not indicative of our_
_historical operating results, nor are they meant to be predictive of future results. These measures are used by our_
_management to monitor the underlying performance of the business and the operations. Since all companies do not_
_calculate these measures in an identical manner, our presentation may not be consistent with similar measures used by_
_other companies. Therefore, investors should not place undue reliance on this data._

_This "Summary financial and other information" should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its_
_entirety by reference to, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this_
_Offering Memorandum, and should also be read together with the information set forth in "Summary", "Important_
_information for investors—Presentation of financial and other information", " Important information for investors—Use_
_of non-IFRS financial measures", "Important information for investors—Other data", "Business", "Use of proceeds",_
_"Capitalization", "Selected historical consolidated financial information" and "Management's discussion and analysis of_
_financial condition and results of operations"._

(a) The comparative information for 2018 included in our financial statements as of and for 2019 included a
reclassification as of December 31, 2018 between Profit (loss) for the financial year and Reserves of fully
consolidated companies, amounting to €19.4 million (comprising Results from exposure to hyperinflation
(IAS 29) of €25.1 million, which was partially offset by Corporation tax of €5.7 million); of which €16.2
million are assigned to the Company and €3.2 million to non-controlling interests). This reclassification has
no impact on total equity and the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 were
not restated. The financial information presented herein is extracted from the comparative period presented
in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019.

(b) Our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflect the application of IFRS 16,
which became effective on January 1, 2019. Our financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2018 were not restated. The main impact of the application of IFRS 16 on the consolidated
statement of profit and loss as of December 31, 2019 are an increase in amortization of right of use assets of
€181.1 million, an increase in financial expenses of €89.6 million and a decrease in rent expenses of €257.3
million. See "Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations".

(2) We define EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by net turnover.

(3) We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for the effect of certain non-recurring items, including gains
or losses from disposals of assets, the variation in the provisions for liabilities and advisory and consultancy
expenses, non-recurring personnel expenses, adjustments for the effect of the application of IFRS 16,
non-recurring lease impacts, and other non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure. The

(a) Management estimates that EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 could be further
adjusted on a pro forma basis for: (1) new openings: an additional contribution of €41.5 million from new openings
that occurred from 2019 to April 2021, assuming such hotels had been open for the full year in 2019, and calculated
based on the business plan for such hotel for its first year of operations; (2) closings: a lower contribution of €8.2
million due to the closing of certain hotels in our portfolio since 2019 to April 2021, assuming such hotels had
been closed for the full year in 2019, and calculated based on the EBITDA contribution of each hotel in the year
ended December 31, 2019; (3) refurbishments: an additional contribution of €15.8 million from our hotels that
were refurbished in 2019, assuming such hotels had been fully operational in 2019, and calculated based on the
2018 performance of such hotels, and (4) efficiencies: €34.4 million in cost savings due to the payroll reduction
as a result of the collective dismissal implemented at our central and corporate services in Spain at the end of
April 2021, other efficiency plans implemented at the operating level (such as a payroll reduction in our food and
beverage, M&E and housekeeping departments to adapt to a more flexible cost structure at hotels across all BUs)
and the optimization and closings of certain of our offices (such as the optimization of outsourced back office
functions and the reduction of space in our head offices). However, these cost savings would have been partially
offset by increased costs, beginning on January 1, 2020, associated with: (a) collective labor agreements; (b) third
party contracts such as laundry, repair and maintenance contracts; (c) commissions due to an increase in indirect
sales channels; and (d) corporate and headquarter services. In addition to the cost savings already achieved, the
Company intends to continue realizing additional cost savings during the rest of 2021 and 2022.

(b) For the year ended December 31, 2018, net losses from disposals of assets consists mainly of
the sale of Barbizon Palace and the sale of LHI Option. For the year ended December 31, 2019, net losses from
disposals of assets consists mainly of gains from the sale of NH Malaga, which were offset in full, mainly by
cancelation lease indemnities in Italy. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2021, net losses from disposals of assets consists of the sale of NH Gent.

(c) Provisions for liabilities and charges (i) for the year ended December 31, 2018, includes
provisions in respect of litigation related to a payment of compensation due to a change of control, a possible
indemnification due to the termination of an agreement with a former executive of the Issuer, a claim related to
the sale of fifteen commercial premises and expenses related to termination of lease agreements such as NH Zurich
and NH Forsthaus; (ii) for the year ended December 31, 2019, includes provisions for advisory and consultancy
expenses related to the acquisition of eight hotels previously operated by the Boscolo Collection and the expenses
related to the integration of Tivoli Hotels in Portugal; (iii) for the year ended December 31, 2020, includes
expenses related to the termination of lease agreements and hotel exits such as such as Berlin Postdam, Berlin
City west, NH Geldrop, NH Louise and others, provisions for advisory expenses related to reductions in personnel
expenses (working days and wages), provisions for claims due to the termination of lease agreements (NH Lord
Charles), and certain claims related to the sale of Sotogrande; (iv) for the three months ended March 31, 2020,
includes expenses related to termination of lease agreements, hotel exits such as NH Geldrop NH Louise and
provisions for advisory expenses related to reductions in personnel cost (working days and wages); (v) for the
three months ended March 31, 2021, includes provisions for legal consultancy due to the layoffs in Spain and
expenses related to the termination of lease agreements such as NH Ciudad Almería, Campus La Moraleja; (vi) for
the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, includes provisions for legal consultancy due to the layoffs in Spain,
expenses related to the termination of lease agreements and hotel exits such as NH Ciudad Almería, Campus La
Moraleja, Berlin Postdam, Berlin City West, and others, provisions for claims due to termination of lease
agreements (NH Lord Charles), and certain claims related to the sale of Sotogrande.

(d) Represents non-recurring personnel expenses, including expenses related to severance
payments and provisions therefor.

(e) Extraordinary cash payments/ receipts includes (i) for the year ended December 31, 2019,
insurance compensation linked to an earthquake in Mexico; (ii) for the year ended December 31, 2020, insurance
compensation linked to a fire incident (NH Conf. Centre Leeuwenhorst); (iii) for the three months ended
March 31, 2020, insurance compensation linked to a fire incident (NH Conf. Centre Leeuwenhorst); (iv) for the
three months ended March 31, 2021, an overdue dividend of Palacio Merced, S.A.; and (v) for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2021, an overdue dividend of Palacio Merced, S.A.

(f) Non-recurring lease impacts includes adjustments related to the provision made for potential
costs associated with the early termination of leases at our option and extraordinary adjustments for the difference
between rent expense recognized on a straight-line basis with respect to our leases and the amount of rent we paid
with respect to our leases.

(g) IFRS 16 effects includes the impact of the application of IFRS 16 not adjusted in previous lines.

**Risk factors**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks,_
_together with other information provided to you in this Offering Memorandum, in deciding whether to invest in the Notes._
_The occurrence of any of the events discussed below could be detrimental to our financial performance. If any of these_
_events occur, the trading price of the Notes could decline, we may not be able to pay all or part of the interest or_
_principal on the Notes, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks not currently known to us or that_
_are presently deemed immaterial may also harm us and affect your investment._

**Risks relating to our business and industry**

**_The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on our industry and business, and may continue to_**
**_have a significant negative impact in the future._**

The COVID-19 pandemic and the various measures taken by governments and other local authorities to contain
the spread of COVID-19 have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant adverse impact on our industry,
business and operations. More specifically, travel restrictions, lockdowns and social distancing measures have severely
impacted our industry, business and operations and, in many cases, temporary closures of our hotels have been
mandatory under local laws and regulations. From March to end of May 2020, approximately 95% of hotels in our
portfolio were temporarily closed, and those which remained open had limited activity. Starting at the end of May 2020,
we gradually reopened our portfolio during the summer months, with approximately 80% open in August and September
2020, until successive waves of COVID-19 resulted in our hotels closing again, with only 60% of hotels in our portfolio
open at the end of December 2020. As a result of such temporary closures and low Occupancy, our net turnover
decreased to €536.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from €1,708.1 million in the prior year, and our
EBITDA decreased to €0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from €567.0 million in the prior year.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a contingency plan to adapt our operations and
preserve liquidity where possible, including temporary lay-offs, reductions in hours and wages of employees at our hotels
and central offices, renegotiations with suppliers to reduce procurement costs, renegotiations with hotel proprietors to
reduce or defer fixed rent expenses, and reduction or deferral of planned or committed capital expenditures. At the end of
April 2021, we implemented a collective dismissal procedure at our central and corporate services in Spain, following
negotiations with employee representatives. While we are continuing to negotiate with certain contractual counterparts,
there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful or, if successful, will be sufficient to avoid negatively
affecting our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. See, "Management's discussion and
_analysis of financial condition and results of operations". Such cost-control measures were not sufficient to meet our_
liquidity requirements and, as a result, we have entered into a number of additional financing arrangements, including a
€225 million Term Facility Arrangement and €25 million Sabadell Bilateral Facility Agreement, which are both currently
fully drawn, and our up to €250 million Senior Secured RCF, of which €236 million remains drawn.

Factors that negatively impact our ability to successfully operate during the COVID-19 pandemic or another
similar epidemic or pandemic include:

    - our ability to keep our hotels open;

    - the willingness or ability of our guests to travel to our hotels due to outbreaks of COVID-19 (or other
similar diseases), and the cost and availability of travel options and changing consumer preferences;

    - our ability to attract and retain guests given the risks, or perceived risks, of gathering in public places;

    - current or future restrictions imposed by governmental authorities, including quarantine requirements,
social distancing, capacity, indoor dining or other restrictions that may affect our operations or the
ability of our guests to access and enjoy our facilities;

    - the shift from in-person business meetings, conferences, trade fairs and other events towards remote
working and virtual or smaller events;

    - actual or perceived deterioration or weakness in economic conditions, unemployment levels, the job or
housing markets, consumer debt levels or consumer confidence, as well as other adverse economic or
market conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, and their collective impact on demand
for travel and leisure;

39


-----

    - our ability to adjust capital spending and maintain sufficient liquidity to remain positioned for longterm success;

    - our ability to incentivize and retain our current employees;

    - the risk of lawsuits related to the COVID-19 pandemic and any measures we have taken in response to
the pandemic, including cost-control measures;

    - the efficacy and timing of distribution of vaccines and the ability of vaccination programs to curtail the
pandemic, including against future mutations and variants of COVID-19;

    - the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial condition of third-party partners, hotel
proprietors, distributors, suppliers and other counterparties and their ability to perform their obligations
under their agreements with us;

    - our ability to access debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all;

    - the impact of disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and
financing conditions on our access to capital necessary to fund operating costs, including maintenance
capital expenditure, or to address maturing liabilities; and

    - our ability to meet the financial ratio covenants under our existing and future debt documentation,
given the impact of the pandemic on our financial performance.

In addition, certain of our hotels were converted into "medicalized hotels" during the pandemic, meaning they
could be used to accommodate patients, thereby alleviating hospitals. We may be required to incur additional expenses,
not assumed or reimbursed by governments or local authorities in order to readapt them again into leisure and business
travel hotels. In general, the re-opening of closed or "medicalized" hotels due to the COVID-19 pandemic may be costly
and time consuming and will require extensive engagement from our management teams, in particular, our human
resources teams. Any failure to successfully reopen closed or "medicalized hotels" could affect the ability of our business
to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The future course of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain and is difficult to predict. However, the longer
the pandemic continues to significantly impact demand at our hotels in the various locations in which we operate, the
greater the material adverse impact on our business will be. While various vaccines are now being administered, the
efficacy and timing of the distribution of vaccines and the ability of vaccination programs to curtail the pandemic,
including against future mutations and variants of COVID-19, remains uncertain. COVID-19 presents material
uncertainty and risk with respect to our business, financial performance and condition, operating results, liquidity and
cash flows. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have
the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this "Risk Factors" section. Any future outbreak of any
other highly infectious or contagious disease could have a similar impact.

**_Our operations are exposed to the risk of events that adversely affect domestic or international travel._**

Our results have been and will continue to be significantly affected by events outside our control that affect the
level of global travel and business activity, including unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics,
including the COVID-19 pandemic discussed above; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, and other political
instability, such as the recent protests and unrest in Catalonia, Spain, as well as in Chile and Colombia; and other
catastrophic events, whether occurring in Europe or internationally. Some governments in the countries in which we
operate have a significant influence on their respective economies. Disruptions to our business operations during peak
periods, for example, as a result of political or economic instability or other adverse conditions in our core markets, could
negatively affect our profitability. In recent years, for example, the downturn in the economy in key travel markets such
as Brazil and Russia, the political and/or economic instability in several Latin American countries such as Argentina and
Venezuela, the military actions in the Middle East, Ukraine and elsewhere have negatively impacted global travel. The
terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015 and Brussels in 2016 and the political instability in Catalonia in 2017 and 2018 also had
a negative impact on the hotel industry in these cities. The occurrence and consequences of such events are
unpredictable, and further attacks, political or economic instability, disease outbreaks or military action could have an
adverse effect on the travel, hospitality and leisure industries in general, affecting the locations in which we operate and
our business and results of operations.

Our results are also affected by periods of abnormal, severe or unseasonal weather conditions, including natural
disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and other adverse weather and climate conditions. While we are insured

40


-----

against certain losses resulting from some of these events, our insurance claims are subject to caps and deductibles,
which vary depending on the hotel. See, "―If the insurance that we carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other
_potential losses involving our hotels, our margins and cash flow could be reduced."_

**_The hotel industry may be materially affected by general economic conditions and other factors outside our control,_**
**_and declines or disruptions in the hotel industry could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial_**
**_condition or prospects._**

Consumer demand for our products and services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy
and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. Declines in consumer demand due to adverse
general economic conditions, epidemics or pandemics, changes in travel patterns, lower consumer confidence or adverse
political conditions can lower the revenues and profitability of our owned and leased properties and the amount of
management fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed properties. Declines in hotel profitability during an
economic downturn directly affect the incentive portion of our management fee revenues, which is based upon measures
of hotel profitability. In addition, to the extent that we have provided a guarantee under a management agreement to meet
certain profitability measures and those measures are not met, during a specified period, typically two or three
consecutive years, we have the option to compensate the hotel proprietor for the shortfall or, if we elect not to
compensate the hotel proprietor, the hotel proprietor may terminate the agreement.

The economic downturn in some of our key markets such as Spain and Italy in the period from 2009 to 2013 led
to a decline in demand for hospitality products and services, lower occupancy levels and reduced room rates, all of which
had a negative impact on our net turnover and negatively affected our profitability. Given the negative impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic, especially in Europe, we are again facing an economic downturn, and we cannot predict whether
our ADR and Occupancy and therefore RevPAR will recover to the same levels experienced prior to such downturn. An
extended period of economic weakness would likely have a further adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.

Furthermore, global economic conditions, particularly in Europe, have significantly affected consumer
confidence and behavior and, as a result, historical performance information may be less effective as a means of
predicting future demand and operating results.

**_A majority of our revenue is generated from operations in Europe, and an economic downturn in Europe could_**
**_intensify the risks faced by the hotel industry, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations,_**
**_financial condition or prospects._**

Our operations are principally located in Europe, and in particular in Spain, Italy, Central Europe and Benelux,
which for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 collectively accounted for 89.5% of our net turnover, with a
significant contribution from leased hotels with fixed rent commitments which have been less profitable during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, our financial performance is particularly affected by economic and financial
conditions in Europe which have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and our results of operations may
be further adversely affected due to the significant fall in demand for hotels. In these circumstances, many of the risks
faced by the hotel industry and our business could intensify, which could negatively affect our business and net turnover
and our access to, and cost of, capital. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may have a negative impact on our main
shareholder, due to its significant exposure to the hotel industry. See, "Shareholders". However, due to the uncertainty
surrounding the future course of the COVID-19 pandemic, these potential consequences are difficult to predict.

**_We operate in a highly competitive industry, and our business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects_**
**_and market share could be adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively._**

The hotel industry is highly competitive. We face a variety of competitive challenges in attracting new guests
and maintaining customer loyalty among our existing customer base, including:

    - anticipating and responding to the needs of our customers;

    - differentiating the quality of our hotel services and products with respect to our competitors;

    - developing and maintaining a strong brand image and a reputation for consistent quality and service
across our hotels;

    - competitively and consistently pricing our rooms and achieving customer perception of value;

41


-----

    - undertaking effective and appropriate promotional activities and effectively responding to promotional
activities of our competitors;

    - maintaining and developing effective website designs, mobile applications and online presence; and

    - attracting and retaining talented employees and management teams.

We compete with hotel operators of varying sizes, including major international chains with well-established
and recognized brands offering a broad range of products, as well as specialist or independent hotel operators. Some of
our competitors have greater market presence and name recognition and stronger brands than we do. Certain competitors
have greater financial resources, greater purchasing economies of scale and lower cost bases than we have. Consequently,
they may be able to spend more on marketing and advertising campaigns, thereby increasing market share. Our
competitors may be able to react more swiftly to changes in market conditions or trends or to offer lower prices or incur
higher costs for longer than we can. The adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing, intensive promotional activities
and discount strategies or other actions that attract customers away from us, as well as our actions to maintain our
competitiveness and reputation, could have an adverse effect on our market share and position, in turn affecting our net
turnover and EBITDA.

Additionally, the use and popularity of sharing economy providers, such as Airbnb, has grown rapidly in recent
years. Sharing economy providers compete against traditional accommodation providers such as hotels and hostels and
may disrupt or reduce customer demand for traditional accommodation or require traditional accommodation providers to
alter their business model or pricing structures in order to compete effectively. Furthermore, our direct booking systems
compete with bookings made by third party intermediaries, such as third-party internet travel intermediaries and online
travel service providers, to whom we pay a commission, reducing our profitability from such bookings as compared to
direct bookings. See, "―If we are unable to establish and maintain key distribution arrangements for our properties, the
_demand for our rooms and our net turnover could decrease." In addition, such platforms may increase the level of_
competition we face from other hotels. See, "―If the amount of sales made through third-party internet travel
_intermediaries increases significantly, we may experience difficulty in maintaining consumer loyalty to our brand."_
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the volume of "alternative accommodation" dropped, as many owners put their
accommodation up for long-term rentals. In addition, the Group has been able to lower its distribution costs (through the
reduction of commissions) and the weight of online sales has been growing in recent years. However, once the COVID19 pandemic subsides, we expect that the hotel industry will experience greater levels of competition, including from
sharing economy providers and third-party intermediaries. We may be forced to adapt to more aggressive commercial
actions that could negatively impact our revenue.

**_Our ability to grow our business depends, in part, upon our ability to enter into new management agreements, and_**
**_there is no guarantee that we will be able to enter into management agreements on terms that are favorable to us, or_**
**_at all._**

We also compete with other hotel operators for management agreements, based primarily on the value and
quality of our management services, our brand name recognition and reputation, our experience and track record of
success in certain regions, our ability and willingness to invest our capital in third-party properties or hospitality venture
projects, the level of our management fee revenue, the terms of our management agreements and the economic
advantages to the hotel proprietor of retaining our management services and using our brand name. Other competitive
factors for management agreements include relationships with third-party hotel proprietors and investors and our
previous performance with such hotel proprietors or investors, including institutional owners of multiple properties,
marketing support and reservation and e-commerce system capacity and efficiency. We believe that our ability to
compete for management agreements primarily depends upon the success of the properties that we currently manage. The
terms of any new management agreements that we obtain also depend upon the terms that our competitors offer for those
agreements. . There is no guarantee that the management agreements we enter into will have favorable terms. For
example, sometimes we assume, in part, the risk of business performance under certain management agreements with
costly performance guarantees based on operating metrics such as gross operating profit. In addition, if the availability of
suitable locations for new properties decreases, planning or other local regulations change or the availability or
affordability of financing is limited, the supply of suitable properties for our management could be diminished. We may
also be required to agree to limitations on the expansion of our brand in certain geographic areas to obtain a management
agreement for a property under development, which could prohibit us from managing or owning other properties in areas
where further opportunities exist. If the properties that we manage perform less successfully than those of our
competitors, if we are unable to offer terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors or if the availability of
suitable properties is limited, our ability to compete effectively for new management agreements could be reduced. In
addition, until the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the market could face additional challenges that could hinder us from
entering into new management agreements.

42


-----

**_Our current hotel management agreements have generated, and may continue to generate, and any future hotel_**
**_management agreements may generate, limited net turnover and negligible EBITDA._**

Our management agreements contributed 1.1%, 1.4% and 1.8% of our net turnover for the years ended
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 2.4% of our net turnover for the three months ended March 31,
2021. Our management agreements may continue to contribute limited net turnover and negligible or negative EBITDA.
In addition, we seek to increase the proportion of our hotels operated under management agreements and, for example,
recently, we added to our portfolio nine management agreements in Portugal, under the brands Tivoli and Anantara. We
cannot provide any assurance, especially considering the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, that our management
agreements will make a positive contribution to our results or EBITDA in the future.

**_We are exposed to risks resulting from significant investments in owned and leased real estate, which could increase_**
**_our costs, reduce our profits, limit our ability to respond to market conditions or restrict our growth strategy._**

As of March 31, 2021, we owned and leased 21.8% and 64.7%, respectively, of our hotels (based on the number
of hotel rooms). Real estate ownership and, to a lesser extent, leasing are subject to risks not applicable to managed
properties, including:

    - governmental regulations relating to real estate ownership;

    - real estate, insurance, zoning, tax, environmental and eminent domain laws;

    - the ongoing need for capital improvements and expenditures to maintain or upgrade properties and
other expenses related to owning or leasing a property, such as insurance;

    - risks associated with mortgage debt, including the possibility of default, fluctuating interest rate levels
and the availability of replacement financing;

    - risks associated with long-term contracts with fixed terms, including continuing fixed obligations in the
face of volatile or changing market conditions;

    - fluctuations in real estate values or potential impairments in the value of our assets; and

    - the relative illiquidity and high transaction costs associated with real estate compared to other assets.

A decline in net turnover negatively affects profitability and cash flow generation to a greater extent with
respect to our owned or leased properties due to their high fixed-cost structure. Moreover, we need to maintain, renovate
or refurbish our owned or leased properties, which can be challenging during periods in which our cash generated from
operations has declined, as is currently occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic. See "Management's discussion and
_analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Key factors affecting our financial condition and results of_
_operations—Repositioning our brand and hotel portfolio and our refurbishment plan". In addition, the fixed-cost nature_
of operating owned and leased hotels may render any cost-cutting efforts less effective compared to our managed hotels.
As a result, we may not be able to offset further net turnover reductions through cost-cutting, which could further reduce
our margins. Our future growth is expected to involve significant amounts of leased real estate, and so such effects could
be exacerbated in the future.

We are also susceptible to volatility in property prices during periods of economic downturn, which results in a
decline in our asset value and limits our flexibility to sell properties at a profit during such periods. In an unfavorable
market, we may not be able to sell properties on commercially attractive terms, or at all, in the short term. Accordingly,
we may not be able to adjust our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions. In addition, because our
repositioning strategy depends in part upon our ability to sell properties and to use proceeds from such sales to fund
operations under our leases or management agreements or to make capital expenditures, any inability to do so could
impair our strategy.

**_Our current and future property portfolio involves a significant amount of leased property, resulting in high levels of_**
**_operating leverage, reduced cost flexibility to withstand downturns and increased dependence on third parties, as well_**
**_as increasing our total leverage from the perspective of banks, rating agencies and capital market investors, which_**
**_may limit our ability to raise financing._**

As of March 31, 2020, we operated 229 hotels under lease agreements, consisting of 35,455 rooms and
representing 64.7% of our total number of hotel rooms in operation.

43


-----

During periods of economic growth, leased hotels typically represent a greater proportion of our total profits.
However, during periods of economic downturn, leased hotels typically represent a smaller proportion of our total profits,
as the cost base for our leased hotels is mostly fixed, negatively impacting our fixed charge coverage ratios. As a result,
the fixed nature of most of our cost base for leased hotels may affect our overall profitability, and even create liquidity
issues to pay the fixed component of the rents. Our future growth is expected to involve significant amounts of leased
real estate, and so such effects could be exacerbated in the future. We can provide no assurance that future leases will be
on the same or similar terms, or as profitable, as our existing leases.

The costs we incur under our leases, such as rent expense and property costs (such as council rates, utilities,
insurance and service charges) constitute our principal fixed costs. We have limited or no control over these costs, and
we may not be able to adjust such costs in a timely manner in response to changes in demand for services or a reduction
in our revenues, especially during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. If our revenue declines and we are unable to
reduce our expenses in a timely manner or are unable or unwilling to pass these costs on to our guests, there may be a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Following the application of IFRS 16, the vast majority of our lease liabilities are considered indebtedness, and
the significant amount of our lease liabilities means that we are highly leveraged. This high level of total leverage is
relevant to lenders and potential lenders, rating agencies and capital markets participants, and may negatively affect our
ability to raise financing on competitive terms, or at all, in the future.

**_We may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in businesses and properties or through alliances and_**
**_partnerships with third parties, and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets, any of which_**
**_may be unsuccessful or divert our management's attention._**

Our growth has been, in part, attributable to acquisitions of other businesses and operations in regions in which
we already operate, such as Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and Latin America. From time to time, we consider and engage
in negotiations with respect to acquisitions. In many cases, we will be competing for opportunities with third parties that
may have substantially greater financial resources than we do or we may enter into partnership or joint venture
agreements in which we hold a minority stake and therefore exercise less influence over operational decisions.
Acquisitions or investments in businesses, properties or assets and entry into alliances or partnerships are subject to risks
that could affect our business and the success of our acquisition strategy depends upon our ability to identify suitable
acquisition targets, to assess the value, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities and potential profitability of such acquisition
targets and to negotiate acceptable purchase terms. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we may need to renegotiate certain
opportunities on less favorable conditions or withdraw from them completely.

We may not be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms, or at
all, and our failure to do so may limit our ability to grow our business. If we are unable to continue to make suitable
acquisitions, our ability to increase our revenues may be adversely affected. We may pursue acquisitions and other
strategic opportunities that are different from those we have sought in the past, including in new international markets.

If we make acquisitions, we may not be able to generate expected margins or cash flows, or to realize the
anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including growth or expected synergies. Similarly, we may not be able to obtain
financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms or at all, and our ability to obtain financing may be restricted
by the terms of the Indenture, the Senior Secured RCF or our other existing and future indebtedness. Additionally, the
pursuit of any acquisition, investment, disposition or strategic relationship may demand significant attention from our
management that would otherwise be available for our regular business operations, which may have an adverse effect on
our business.

From time to time, we consider and engage in negotiations with respect to disposals of assets. For example, in
November 2014, we sold our 97% stake in Sotogrande, retaining ownership of certain international assets. More recently,
in 2018, we engaged in a sale and leaseback transaction with respect to the NHC Barbizon Palace in Amsterdam,
generating a net cash inflow of €121.8 million. Divestment of some of our properties or assets may yield returns below
our investment criteria or include some fixed lease obligations. In some circumstances, sales of our properties may result
in investment losses. Our asset disposals may be made at prices that are below market or book values, resulting in capital
losses coupled with tax payment obligations. Further, we typically enter into sale agreements that contain representations,
warranties and indemnification provisions and we have received certain claims for indemnification pursuant to these
provisions and may receive such claims in the future.

**_Acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing business, increase our expenses and may adversely affect our operating results_**
**_if we cannot effectively integrate these new operations. In addition, certain acquisitions may be structured such that_**
**_we do not have sole control or ownership over the acquired assets._**

The success of our acquisitions and investments will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the acquisition or
investment with our existing operations and to effect any required changes in operations or personnel. Such integration
may require more investment than we expect, and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or
contingencies with respect to customers, employees, suppliers, government authorities or other parties, which may
impact our operating results. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our assessments of and assumptions regarding
acquisition targets will prove correct, and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations, which may
hamper our integration efforts.

The process of integrating businesses may be disruptive to our operations and may cause an interruption of, or a
loss of momentum in, such businesses or a decrease in our results of operations as a result of difficulties or risks,
including:

    - unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual and other issues;

    - difficulty in standardizing information and other systems;

    - difficulty in realizing operating synergies;

    - diversion of management's attention from our day-to-day business; and

    - failure to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided.

Any failure to properly integrate an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition or prospects. Additionally, we may face difficulty integrating acquisitions that
operate under business models distinct from our own. For example, as a result of our acquisition of the share capital of
Hoteles Royal in March 2015, we operate hotels which we also own together with several co-proprietors, under lease and
management agreements. These lease and management agreements include various branding and operating requirements
which could prevent us from successfully implementing our rebranding and operating strategies in respect of these hotels.
See "—We own, and may acquire, interests in hotels and in other assets, such as real estate owning companies, under
_co-ownership, partnership agreements, joint ventures or similar arrangements with third parties that may expose us to_
_additional liabilities or capital requirements."_

**_If our management agreements terminate at the option of the hotel proprietor due to our failure to satisfy certain_**
**_performance metrics or upon the occurrence of other specified events, our net turnover could decrease and our costs_**
**_could increase._**

Certain of our management agreements allow the hotel proprietor to terminate the agreement early for under
performance or if we fail to compensate the hotel proprietor for any shortfall in applicable profitability metrics, such as
certain levels of RevPar or gross operating profit, which is determined by comparison with a minimum threshold
established in the management agreement. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, if a hotel proprietor files for bankruptcy,
our management agreement with the hotel proprietor may be terminated under applicable law. The hotel proprietor may
also terminate the management agreement early following a payment default. If a management agreement is terminated at
the option of the hotel proprietor, we would no longer receive the net turnover derived under the agreement, and we
could incur costs related to terminating the agreement with the third party and exiting the related property. In addition,
upon termination of the management agreement, we would lose a NH branded hotel in the area where the hotel was
located, and we may not be able to replace the hotel with another hotel in the same location, which could result in a loss
of customers and net turnover.

**_We may not be successful in executing our strategy of exiting underperforming leases and management agreements_**
**_and of disposing of selected assets, which could hinder our ability to expand our presence in markets that would_**
**_enhance and expand our brand preference._**

We regularly review our business to identify underperforming hotels and assets. We may need to further
examine our business once the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic can be duly evaluated, since the impact of the
pandemic may significantly increase the number of underperforming leases and the losses incurred. Upon identifying a
market or type of property that is underperforming, we evaluate the terms of the agreements governing the
underperforming hotels, the market conditions and the location of the hotel to determine if we can renegotiate the terms
on a more favorable basis or if we should terminate the arrangements or otherwise dispose of the assets to ensure that our

45


-----

assets are aligned with our strategy. From time to time, we may decide to exit unprofitable leases or management
agreements or to selectively dispose of hotel properties to generate proceeds that can be used to repay debt and fund our
growth in markets that will enhance and expand our brand presence. However, our lease agreements generally do not
provide for early termination at our option without cause (some of them even establish a penalty in case of early
termination), and we may not be able to agree on terms for the early termination of our leases with the owners of those
properties on favorable terms, or at all. Hotel owners may bring claims against us for breach of contract or loss of
income, and we may suffer reputational harm. We may experience difficulty in terminating certain unprofitable leases
and management agreements during periods of economic downturn, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, due to
the difficulty of finding replacement tenants and service providers that are willing to enter into new agreements on terms
acceptable to the hotel owners. In addition, we may not be able to consummate sales of our hotels on commercially
reasonable terms at the time we choose or at all, and we may not actually realize anticipated profits from such sales. In
addition, our real estate assets are subject to market volatility in each region, which may decrease the market value of
those assets. During periods of challenging economic conditions, potential real estate buyers may experience difficulty
obtaining the financing required to purchase a real estate asset from us. Our inability to exit underperforming hotels, to
sell assets at all or to sell assets at attractive prices could have an adverse effect on our ability to realize proceeds for
reinvestment or may lead to a potential breach of certain financial covenants applicable to us under the terms of our
various debt instruments and have a negative impact on our financing arrangements.

**_We may incur significant costs in connection with exiting or renegotiating the terms of underperforming leases, or we_**
**_may incur further losses if we are unable to exit or renegotiate such underperforming leases._**

From time to time, we may decide to exit or renegotiate the terms of unprofitable leases. In such circumstances,
we will enter into private negotiations with the relevant landlord in order to agree terms for early termination or new
terms, including rent or duration of the lease. We may incur significant costs in connection with the termination or
renegotiation of such leases, and we cannot guarantee that the new lease terms will reflect current market conditions. In
some cases, we may not be able to terminate the lease on favorable terms, or at all.

Typically, our lease agreements include a minimum rent payment obligation that is independent of the revenue
generated by the hotel. In the event that we are unable to exit or renegotiate the terms of an unprofitable lease, we may
incur ongoing losses for the remaining term of the lease. In addition, under a few of our lease agreements, we are
required to invest an agreed percentage of the relevant hotel revenue or a predetermined fixed sum in the maintenance of
the hotel with respect to furniture, fixtures and equipment and interior of the hotel, excluding the façade and external
structure. If the investment requirements are based on a fixed sum, we will be required to make the investments
regardless of whether the leased hotel generates profits or losses. As a result, the required investments and capital
expenditures may exceed the amount of revenue generated from operating the hotel or may increase the amount of the
loss incurred. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase of underperforming leases, we may incur
further losses if we are unable to exit or renegotiate such underperforming leases and, during the course of the COVID19 pandemic, we have both brought claims and had claims brought against us relating to our efforts to terminate early or
renegotiate our underperforming leases. See "Business—Principal business activities—Hotel operations—Leased hotels".

**_The value of our properties reflected on our balance sheet and in this Offering Memorandum and the book value of_**
**_our hotels and assets included in this Offering Memorandum is based in part upon the results of third-party_**
**_valuations, and because property and asset valuation is inherently subjective and uncertain, the projections or_**
**_assumptions used, estimates made or procedures followed in the third-party valuation of our properties and assets may_**
**_not be correct, accurate or complete and may suffer severe devaluations due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic._**

To report the value of our properties and assets, we rely in part upon third-party valuations. These third-party
valuations are reflected in, and form a large part of, the value of our properties recorded on our balance sheet and the
book value of our hotels and assets included in this Offering Memorandum. Certain of our properties and assets were
valued by Duff & Phelps as of December 31, 2020. The basis of the valuation carried out by Duff & Phelps varies
according to the type of asset being valued and, therefore, the aggregate value of the Collateral as of December 31, 2020
of €1,319 million, may not reflect the total market value of such properties and assets or the amount that could be
realized upon the sale of such properties and assets.

Each valuation in the Duff & Phelps Report was prepared by Duff & Phelps on the basis of market value in
accordance with the International Valuation Standards Committee. "Market value" is defined as the estimated amount for
which an asset or liability should exchange on the valuation date between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm's
length transaction, after proper marketing and where the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without
compulsion. Duff & Phelps' valuation of the Collateral was based upon the income approach using the DCF method,
which according to Duff & Phelps, is the generally accepted approach for the valuation of a business or assets on a
going-concern basis. For a detailed discussion of the valuation methodology, see "Business—Valuation of the
_Collateral—Basis of valuation and assumptions"._

46


-----

In preparing its valuations, Duff & Phelps made certain assumptions, and relied on estimates and projected
information provided by us. For the Mortgage Properties and the Share Collateral, Duff & Phelps based its valuation of
the appraised hotel properties on historical financial information of the appraised hotel properties from 2008 through
2020, the book value of non-current fixed assets of the appraised hotel properties as of December 31, 2020, prospective
financial information for the appraised hotel properties for 2021 through 2025, which reflect our estimates of the future
performance of the assets included in the valuation, and industry reports published by third parties. Duff & Phelps also
consulted the COVID-19 recovery plan presented to the management committee. For the NH Italia Shares valued,
Duff & Phelps based its valuation on the balance sheet of NH Italia as of December 31, 2020, prospective financial
information for NH Italia for 2021 through 2025, which reflects our estimates of the future performance of the business
of NH Italia, and industry reports published by third parties. In addition, Duff & Phelps analyzed published information
concerning the economy and the industry in which the assets operate to assess the ability of the assets to generate future
investment returns.

The assumptions or projections used, estimates made or procedures followed in preparing the valuations of our
properties and assets may not be correct, accurate or complete and may suffer severe devaluation due to the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Other appraisers may reach different valuations of our properties and assets. In addition, each
valuation speaks only as of the valuation date and actual results may differ materially from the assumptions and
projections used and estimates made in the valuations. For example, our results could differ from the projections made in
the valuations as a result of a new economic downturn, especially following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic,
renewed financial turmoil or market volatility, our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel or greater than
expected environmental liabilities or planning requirements, among other factors. This is particularly relevant in periods
of volatility or when there is limited real estate transactional data against which such a property or asset valuation can be
benchmarked. If valuations of our properties and assets prove to be unfounded, our balance sheet results could be
significantly adversely affected.

Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any valuation will be reflected in any actual transaction prices. The
amount obtained from the actual sale of our property portfolio and assets may be significantly lower than any valuation
thereof, even where any such transaction occurs shortly after the relevant valuation date, and the estimated cash flows
projected in the valuation may not be attainable, especially in a distressed or liquidation scenario. Failure to achieve
successful sales of properties and assets in the future at commercially reasonable prices could have an adverse effect on
our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.

The realizable value of our property portfolio and assets at any given time will depend upon various factors,
including:

    - the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;

    - market, macroeconomic and hotel industry conditions, including demand and capacity for hotels;

    - whether any additional property sales are anticipated;

    - the effect any sale may have on the remaining portfolio;

    - the availability of buyers;

    - the availability of financing;

    - the impact of foreign exchange;

    - the time period in which the properties or assets are to be sold;

    - the supply of similar properties;

    - the condition of the properties;

    - regulatory and political risks, including obtaining any necessary consents or acquiring permits required
to operate the properties as hotels; and

    - other operational cost risks.

The appraised value of our properties and assets has changed in the past and we anticipate that it will continue to
change over time, possibly materially. Accordingly, any valuation should not be considered as a guarantee of present or

47


-----

future value. After the issuance of the Notes, we will not provide holders of Notes with revised valuations of our
properties, except as shown in our consolidated financial statements and we expressly disclaim any duty to update any
valuation under any other circumstances.

**_We own, and may acquire, interests in hotels or in other assets, such as real estate owning companies, under_**
**_co-ownership, partnership agreements, joint ventures or similar arrangements with third parties that may expose us to_**
**_additional liabilities or capital requirements._**

In some markets, we operate through co-ownership, partnerships, joint ventures or similar structures with third
parties. Although we seek to minimize risks associated with such structures before investing with other partners, the
actions of our partners could cause additional risks, such as project delays, increased costs or operational difficulties after
project completion, or not receiving a return on investment. In addition, our partners could have financial difficulties and
conflicts with us, which may affect the activities of our joint undertakings.

We are unable to unilaterally control material decisions with respect to operations conducted pursuant to these
co-ownership, partnership or joint venture agreements, and we may have little influence over such decisions if we hold a
minority stake. For example, as a result of our acquisition of Hoteles Royal in March 2015, we operate hotels, which we
own together with several co-proprietors, under lease and management agreements that provide us with exclusive
management rights. Because we do not own a majority stake in these hotels, in the case of underperformance, our
co-proprietors may try to terminate our exclusive lease and management agreements. We cannot provide assurance that
there will not be disagreements with our co-proprietors or that several of our co-proprietors holding a sufficient aggregate
stake in such acquired hotels will not terminate the lease and management agreements. See "—Acquisitions may disrupt
_our ongoing business, increase our expenses and may adversely affect our operating results if we cannot effectively_
_integrate these new operations. In addition, certain acquisitions may be structured such that we do not have sole control_
_or ownership over the acquired assets."_

Some of our joint venture agreements provide that significant decisions regarding joint venture strategy will be
made by super majorities, which can hinder and delay the adoption of measures and the securing of agreements and even
cause deadlocks. Such delays or deadlocks could trigger additional liabilities for us. Some of our agreements also provide
exit clauses for the minority shareholders, whereby preset formulae are used to calculate the value of the relevant interest
and the terms of payment. However, the formulae may require valuations or other assessments by valuation experts or
advisors before amounts payable or receivable by us are determined, which may result in uncertainty. In the past,
minority shareholders of one of our subsidiaries exercised a put option in respect of their shares pursuant to certain
contractual arrangements with us. We contested the exercise price in respect of the put option, as determined by a
third-party valuation expert, which led to a litigation proceeding which ended in 2015. In addition, a minority shareholder
of another one of our subsidiaries filed a claim for damages in respect of an alleged breach of our obligations under a call
option agreement in respect of part of our shareholding interest. This has led to a litigation that is still ongoing. There is
no assurance that similar occurrences will not happen in the future.

We may invest in other co-ownership schemes, partnerships, joint ventures or similar arrangements in the future
that own hotels and have recourse or non-recourse debt financing. If a joint undertaking defaults under a secured loan, the
lender may accelerate the loan and demand payment in full before taking action to foreclose on the hotel. A joint
undertaking may not have sufficient assets or insurance to discharge its liability, and as a partner or member in the
venture, we may be exposed to liability for claims asserted against it, which could have a material adverse effect on us.

If we fail to identify and enter into attractive markets, to find suitable business partners with whom we can
operate the business effectively and on reasonable terms, to identify and lease hotels in popular locations on acceptable
terms or to raise the required funds, our expansion plans may be jeopardized. In addition, our hotels that are operated
pursuant to such arrangements may perform at levels below expectations, resulting in potential insolvency unless our
partners provide additional funds. In some cases, our partners may elect not to make additional capital contributions, in
which case we would be required to invest additional capital with no guarantee of a return on our investment or risk
losing our investment.

**_Timing, budgeting and other risks could delay our efforts to develop, redevelop or renovate our owned and leased_**
**_properties, or make these activities more expensive, which could reduce our profits or impair our ability to compete_**
**_effectively._**

We must maintain and renovate our owned and leased properties to remain competitive, maintain our value and
brand proposition as presented by our new architecture and design concepts, and comply with applicable laws and
regulations and certain contractual obligations under our leases. These efforts are subject to a number of risks, including:

    - the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;

    - construction delays or cost overruns, including labor and materials, that may increase project costs;

    - obtaining zoning, occupancy and other required permits or authorizations to operate;

    - governmental restrictions on the size or kind of development;

    - force majeure events, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods or tsunamis, epidemics or pandemics;
and

    - construction or design defects that could increase costs.

Developing new properties typically involves lengthy development periods during which significant amounts of
capital must be funded before the properties can begin to operate. If the cost of funding the developments or renovations
exceeds budgeted amounts, profits could be reduced. Moreover, we may not be able to satisfy our capital commitments
under certain of our agreements, and we may be subject to monetary penalties or other losses as a result.

Similarly, the timing of capital improvements can affect property performance, including Occupancy and
Average Daily Rate, particularly if we need to close a significant number of hotel rooms or other facilities, such as
ballrooms, meeting spaces or restaurants. Moreover, the investments that we make, either directly or indirectly through
arrangements with a project management company, may fail to improve the performance of the properties in the manner
that we expect.

If we are not able to begin operating properties as scheduled, or if investments adversely affect or fail to
improve performance or our ability to compete effectively, our net turnover and cash flow could be reduced.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to fund capital expenditures required to maintain or improve our_**
**_properties._**

As of December 31, 2020, we have completed approximately €371 million of investments (€320 million as of
December 31, 2019) as part of our repositioning initiative launched in 2014. As of December 31, 2020, a total of 107
hotels were refurbished, representing approximately 30% of our hotel portfolio. These hotels were selected as we believe
they are the most likely to yield higher Occupancy and ADR and to enhance the value of our owned and long term leased
assets. Out of the 11 hotels that are Mortgage Properties or properties that are owned or leased by entities whose shares
form part of the Share Collateral (excluding NH Italia), we have refurbished five hotels. Regarding the assets which are
owned or leased by NH Italia, 13 refurbishments have been completed and eight more are in progress and we intend to
refurbish additional hotels that are owned or leased by NH Italia. Our refurbishment program involves modernizing
rooms and common areas by refreshing paint and floor coverings and replacing furnishings and finishings. In certain
hotels, we intend to complete a refurbishment of the entire building, including all mechanical, electrical and plumbing
systems. Our ability to execute this capital intensive refurbishment program will depend on our ability to generate cash,
which could be adversely affected during economic downturns. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2020,
due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we deferred approximately €100 million, or 50%, of our planned capital expenditure in
an effort to preserve liquidity. In addition, certain of our hotel assets are currently underinvested and require more prompt
attention and higher levels of expenditure than others. Our inability to generate sufficient cash to carry out work
necessary to maintain such properties could have a material adverse effect on our operations in these hotels and
ultimately the value of these assets. Our failure to complete our refurbishment program to the extent or in the timeframe
contemplated could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.

**_If we are not able to develop and implement new initiatives successfully, our business and profitability could be_**
**_harmed._**

As part of our planned repositioning of our hotels, we intend to launch new initiatives, including new marketing
programs as part of our plan to redefine, develop and promote our brands, which can be a time-consuming and expensive

49


-----

process. We also plan to invest capital and resources in refurbishing certain of our owned and leased properties as part of
our repositioning initiative. See "Business—Our strategy". If our initiatives are not well received by our employees,
guests and hotel proprietors, they may not have the intended effect of yielding higher Occupancy and ADR in the future.
We may not be able to recover the costs incurred in developing our brands or other development projects and initiatives
or to realize their intended or projected benefits, which could adversely affect our margins and cash flow. In addition, due
to the COVID-19 pandemic, we may not have any cash available to spend on repositioning programs or marketing
programs. For example, we significantly reduced our marketing and advertising costs during the COVID-19 pandemic,
and such cost control measures could negatively impact our ability to recover from the impact of the pandemic.

**_The development of new hotels and the expansion of existing hotels are subject to a number of risks beyond our_**
**_control, including insufficient growth in demand for hotel rooms._**

In order to remain competitive, we incur significant capital investment to increase our hotel room portfolio. It
typically takes several months or years from the commencement of a project to completion of a new hotel, and demand
for hotel rooms in particular locations may change significantly between the time we make the decision to enter a
particular market or region and the time at which a hotel commences operations. If future demand for our hotels does not
match the growth in our hotel room portfolio (as is the case currently, due to the COVID-19 pandemic), we may
experience lower Occupancy than expected or be required to lower our room rates in a particular hotel to attract
customers, which could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our investments and our results of operations.

**_We may not be able to adapt our hotels to reflect any changes in business mix._**

Any change in the business mix, for example decreases in the number of business travelers as opposed to leisure
travelers or in the number of international travelers as opposed to domestic travelers, could negatively impact the results
of our hotels which are not adapted for such changes. For example, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, business travel has
been particularly affected and, as remote working and virtual meetings and events have increased, there is uncertainty as
to whether business travel, and related in-person meetings and events, will resume at similar rates as prior to the
pandemic. Such a shift in business mix could negatively impact our hotels that cater to business travelers and we may not
be able to adapt such hotels to cater to leisure travelers in a cost efficient or timely manner, or at all. Such changes in
business mix, or any other changes in business mix, could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.

**_If third-party proprietors of the properties we manage fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve their_**
**_properties, preference for our brand and our reputation could suffer or our management agreements with those_**
**_parties could terminate._**

As of March 31, 2021, 13.6% of our hotels (based on number of hotel rooms) were owned by third parties and
managed by us under the terms of management agreements. Substantially all our management agreements require
third-party hotel proprietors to comply with standards that are essential to maintaining our brand integrity and reputation.
We depend upon third-party hotel proprietors to comply with the requirements by maintaining and improving properties
through investments, including investments in furniture, fixtures, amenities and personnel.

Third-party hotel proprietors may be unable to access capital or unwilling to spend available capital when
necessary, particularly during periods of economic downturn, even if required by the terms of our management
agreements. Moreover, although the standards with which hotel proprietors must comply are generally consistent across
our management agreements and aligned with industry standards, hotel proprietors may interpret and apply these
standards differently, and as a result, there may be significant differences in quality and appearance among the hotels we
manage. If third-party hotel proprietors fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties we
manage, or to make improvements in accordance with the standard of quality we expect, our brand preference and
reputation could suffer. In addition, if third-party hotel proprietors breach the terms of our agreements with them, we may
be required to take remedial action, including electing to exercise our termination rights, which would eliminate our net
turnover from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these agreements.

**_If we are unable to maintain relationships with third-party hotel proprietors, our net turnover could decrease and we_**
**_may be unable to expand our presence._**

We earn fees for managing hotels and other properties. Our management agreements typically provide a
two-tiered fee structure that compensates us both for the volume of business we generate for the property as well as for
the profitability of hotel operations. Our base compensation is a base fee that is usually an agreed upon percentage of
gross net turnover from hotel operations. We also earn an incentive fee that is typically calculated as a percentage of a
hotel profitability measure, such as gross operating profit, adjusted profit or the amount by which gross operating profit
or adjusted profit exceeds a fixed threshold.

50


-----

The viability of our management business depends upon our ability to establish and maintain relationships with
third-party hotel proprietors. Third- party hotel proprietors are focused on maximizing the value of their investment and
working with a management company that can help them be successful. The effectiveness of our management, the value
of our brands and the rapport that we maintain with third-party hotel proprietors affect renewals and the success of our
tenders for new management agreements and are all important factors for new third-party hotel proprietors considering
doing business with us. Continued relationships with these third parties are likely to generate additional property
development opportunities that support our growth. If we are unable to maintain good working relationships with
third-party hotel proprietors or if we do not meet or exceed their expectations, the hotel proprietors may be unwilling to
renew existing agreements or expand our relationships with them and our opportunities for developing new relationships
with additional third parties may be adversely affected.

**_Contractual and other disagreements with third-party hotel proprietors could make us liable to them or result in_**
**_litigation costs or other expenses, which could lower our profits._**

Our management agreements require us and third-party hotel proprietors to comply with operational and
performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements. Additionally, some courts
have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of third- party hotel properties such as
us, which means, among other things, that hotel proprietors may assert the right to terminate management agreements
even where the agreements do not expressly provide for termination. In the event of any such termination, we may need
to negotiate or enforce our right to a termination payment and even if we are successful, a termination payment is
unlikely to equal the expected net turnover we would have achieved over the term of the agreement. Such disagreements
are more likely to occur during periods of challenging economic conditions. Moreover, third-party hotel proprietors may
claim that we do not satisfy our obligations under our management agreements and may not pay us fees in the full
amounts due under the terms of the management agreements. For example, in 2019 we filed a claim against a hotel
proprietor for undue use of our brand; and in 2020 we filed a separate claim against the same hotel proprietor for
payment default.

We generally seek to resolve any disagreements directly with third-party hotel proprietors. However, to the
extent that we cannot resolve matters directly with the hotel proprietor, we may pursue remedies through arbitration, if
provided under the applicable management agreement, or through litigation, which can be costly and time consuming.
We cannot predict the outcome of any such arbitration or litigation, the effect of any adverse judgment of a court or
arbitrator against us or the amount of any settlement that we may be forced to enter into with any third party.

**_If we or third-party hotel proprietors are unable to repay or refinance mortgages secured by the hotel properties, our_**
**_net turnover could be reduced and our business could be harmed._**

Many of our properties owned by third-party hotel proprietors and certain properties that we own are pledged as
collateral for secured loans entered into when these properties were purchased or refinanced. If we or third-party hotel
proprietors are unable to repay or refinance maturing indebtedness, lenders could declare a default, accelerate the related
debt and repossess the related property. During an economic downturn, such as the current economic downturn due to the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial number of hotel proprietors may experience financial difficulties and
the properties they own could be or become increasingly vulnerable to financial stress. Debt defaults could lead
third-party hotel proprietors to sell the property on unfavorable terms or, in the case of secured debt, to convey the
mortgaged property to the lender. Any sales or repossessions could, in certain cases, result in the termination of our
management agreements or eliminate any anticipated income and cash flows from, and, if applicable, our invested capital
in, such property, which could significantly harm our business.

**_We may not meet certain financial ratios and levels imposed on us under the Senior Secured RCF or the COVID_**
**_Related ICO Facilities._**

While we have met financial ratios imposed on us under the Senior Secured RCF in the past, we may not meet
such ratios, or similar ratios applicable under the COVID Related ICO Facilities or other debt, in the future, in particular,
due to the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our industry and business. The lenders under the Senior
Secured RCF have agreed to a waiver of the financial covenants set forth in the Senior Secured RCF Agreement up to
and including December 31, 2021, as well as a significant reduction to the levels required to be met up to and including
June 30, 2022, with the result that the ratios required to be met will be returned to their original levels starting on
December 31, 2022. In connection with the Offering, the lenders under the Senior Secured RCF have also agreed to a
waiver of the financial covenants for the full year of 2022. The effectiveness of this waiver is conditional upon the
closing of the Offering on the Issue Date. Additionally, the lenders under the COVID Related ICO Facilities have agreed
to a waiver of the financial covenants set forth in such agreements up to and including June 30, 2022, with the result that
compliance will not be tested until December 31, 2022. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to

51


-----

meet the financial ratios upon the expiry of the applicable waivers, or that we will meet financial ratios under any other
current or future indebtedness.

Any default under the Senior Secured RCF or the COVID Related ICO Facilities could lead to an event of
default under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including, without
limitation, the Indenture, the Senior Secured RCF and COVID Related ICO Facilities. If our creditors, including creditors
under such agreements, accelerate the payment of outstanding amounts, our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries may
not be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and
payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. If we are unable to repay those amounts,
our creditors could enforce any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts, including the Collateral.

**_If we or third-party hotel proprietors are unable to access the capital necessary to fund current operations or_**
**_implement our growth plans, our profits could be reduced and our ability to compete effectively could be diminished._**

The hotel industry is a capital-intensive business that requires significant capital expenditures to develop,
operate, maintain and renovate properties. Access to the capital that we or third-party hotel proprietors need to finance
the construction of new properties or to maintain and renovate existing properties is critical to the continued growth of
our business and our net turnover.

The uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a significant impact on
the credit markets, and the financial services industry may experience a period of significant disruption, increased
volatility in securities prices and diminished liquidity and credit availability. As a result of these market conditions, the
cost and availability of capital may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads.
The availability of capital or the conditions under which we or third-party hotel proprietors can obtain capital can have a
significant effect on the overall level and pace of future development and, therefore, the ability to grow our net turnover.
The recent disruptions to the capital markets has diminished the ability and desire of existing and potential development
partners to access capital necessary to actively develop properties. These disruptions could also result in downgrades to
our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our partners. For example, since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, both
Fitch and Moody's have downgraded our credit ratings. Such downgrades could limit our access to capital and increase
the cost of our access to capital, and any such downgrades in respect of our partners or potential partners could have a
similar impact.

If we are forced to spend more cash from operating activities than anticipated to operate, maintain or renovate
existing properties, then our ability to use cash for other purposes, including acquisition or development of properties,
could be limited and our profits could be reduced. If we cannot access the capital we need to fund our operations or
implement our growth strategy, we may need to postpone or cancel planned renovations or developments, which could
impair our ability to compete effectively and harm our business.

**_In any particular period in which we experience a decrease in our net turnover, our operating expenses may not_**
**_decrease at the same rate, which could have an adverse effect on our net cash flows, margins and profits._**

Many of the expenses associated with operating hotels are relatively fixed. These expenses include personnel
expenses, interest, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities. If we are unable to decrease our costs significantly or
rapidly when demand for our hotels and other properties decreases, the decline in our net turnover can have a particularly
adverse effect on our net cash flows and profits, potentially creating liquidity constraints in a context when refinancing
debt or raising new financing facilities may be compromised due to disrupted financial markets. This effect can be
especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth, such as the economic downturn
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, we have brought a number of claims against
third parties, including hotel proprietors, in order to obtain rent reductions and challenge the amount of fixed expenses
that such parties claim are owed to them under the applicable contracts; however, such efforts may not be successful and
may prove costly and time-consuming and negatively impact our relationships with such parties. Economic downturns
generally affect the results derived from owned or leased properties more significantly than those derived from managed
properties given the greater exposure that owners or lessees have to the properties' performance. If future cost-cutting
efforts are insufficient to offset any future declines in net turnover, we could experience a material decline in margins and
potentially negative cash flows.

**_Demand for our hotel rooms and our other products and services is subject to seasonal fluctuations in customer_**
**_demand._**

Our net turnover and cash flows depend upon numerous factors, such as bookings and RevPAR. In the hotel
industry, these factors are affected by seasonality, depending upon the location and category of hotels. For example, the
number of tourist arrivals in Europe changes significantly depending upon the season, and the majority of hotel stays in

52


-----

the region is concentrated in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,
most of the hotels affected by the pandemic have been temporarily closed during the second and third quarters of 2020
or, if opened, had extremely low Occupancy, and such trends are expected to continue in 2021.

The level of demand for our hotel rooms and our other products and services fluctuates over the course of the
calendar year and, while there are variations among the geographies in which we operate, our Occupancy and net
turnover is generally highest from April through June and from September through October. However, a significant
proportion of our expenses is incurred more evenly throughout the year. Therefore, our profitability fluctuates during the
year and we typically record losses during the first quarter of the year and tend to generate profits for the remainder of
the year. Accordingly, our liquidity is typically at its highest during our peak periods from April through June and from
September through October, and at its lowest during the first quarter of the year.

**_If we are unable to establish and maintain key distribution arrangements for our properties, the demand for our_**
**_rooms and our net turnover could decrease._**

A portion of the rooms at our hotels are booked through third-party internet travel intermediaries and online
travel service providers, such as Booking.com, Expedia and trivago. We also engage third-party intermediaries who
collect fees by charging our hotels a commission on room revenues, including travel agencies and meeting and event
management companies. A failure by our distributors to attract or retain their customer bases would lower demand for
our hotel rooms and, in turn, reduce our net turnover.

If bookings by third-party intermediaries increase, the intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions
or other significant contract concessions from us, increasing the overall cost of the third-party distribution channels.
Some of our distribution agreements are not exclusive, have a short term, are terminable at will, or are subject to early
termination provisions. The loss of distributors, increased distribution costs or the renewal of distribution agreements on
significantly less favorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations.

**_If the amount of sales made through third-party internet travel intermediaries increases significantly, we may_**
**_experience difficulty in maintaining consumer loyalty to our brand._**

We have seen a shift in hotel bookings from traditional to online channels. Accordingly, we derive a significant
portion of our business from internet travel intermediaries, most of which devote equal space and attention to all the hotel
operators listed on their websites. In addition, various websites publish user reviews based upon personal testimonies,
including photos, that have not been vetted or verified. Although we actively monitor online reviews of our hotels
through our "Quality Focus On Line" tool, we have little control over the way in which our hotels and our offering of
services and products are portrayed through these third-party sites. Our hotels may be categorized according to the search
criteria deemed appropriate by the travel intermediaries and may be grouped together with other hotels that are made to
look more desirable, for example due to proximity to tourist sites or based upon user reviews. Some internet travel
intermediaries may emphasize factors such as price or general indicators of quality (for example, "four-star downtown
hotel") at the expense of brand identification. Such measures are aimed at developing customer loyalty with respect to the
reservation system used rather than to our brands. If sales made through internet travel intermediaries increase
significantly and consumers develop stronger loyalties to these intermediaries rather than to our brands, we may
experience a decline in customer loyalty and repeat business and consequently, our business and net turnover could be
harmed.

**_We rely on the value of our brand, and any failure to maintain or enhance customer awareness of our brand could_**
**_adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects._**

As a chain hotel operator, our brand, image and reputation constitute a significant part of our value proposition
and serve to enhance our recognition among customers. We depend on our ability to develop our brand and our image as
a leading hotel operator across Europe, and we leverage this reputation in other markets where we have a growing
presence. Travelers expect that we will provide a consistent level of quality and value, and this reputation has
strengthened our image and brand across our hotels worldwide. Any event, such as the poor quality of products and
services, whether as a result of the actions of our employees or financial limitations, that leads to customer complaints or
negative publicity or reviews by customers could damage our image, reputation or brand, which could negatively affect
our business. Our reputation could also be damaged if customer complaints or negative reviews of us or our activities
were to be published on travel websites, social media or other public platforms.

In addition, we have reorganized our hotels into three core brands and, through a reciprocal master licensing
agreement with MINT signed on February 7, 2019, have a license to use MINT's corresponding commercial brands
(Anantara, Avani, Oaks and Tivoli) in geographical areas where we operate. Currently, we operate six hotels in Europe
under the luxury Anantara brand and 10 hotels under the upper upscale Tivoli brand. We believe that developing and

53


-----

expanding our brands are important aspects of our efforts to attract and expand our customer base, but our efforts may
not be successful or our results of operations may not improve to the extent anticipated. Our expenditures to develop and
promote our brands will increase due to a variety of factors, including increased spending from our competitors, the
increased costs of supporting multiple brands and inflation in media pricing. We intend to spend considerable financial
and human resources on developing and promoting our brands, and we will continue to invest in, and devote resources to,
advertising and marketing, as well as other brand-building efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our
brands, which will require attention from management.

There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our
brands or that our initiative to reposition our brands will be successful or cost-effective. If we are unable to maintain or
enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a cost-effective manner, it would negatively affect
our ability to compete in the hotel industry and would negatively affect our business. As media and technology, such as
social media and smart phones, continue to develop, we will need to spend more time and resources to develop new
means to promote our brand awareness through such media outlets. If we are unable to adapt to new media forms, we
may lose market share, which would negatively affect our business.

**_Labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor_**
**_costs that could reduce our margins and cash flow, which may result in a weaker control framework._**

Our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract, retain, train, manage and engage our employees. If
we are unable to attract, retain, train and engage skilled employees, our ability to manage and staff our properties
adequately could be impaired, which could reduce customer satisfaction. Staffing shortages could also hinder our ability
to grow and expand our business. Because personnel expenses are a major component of the operating expenses at our
properties, a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages, which would increase our personnel expenses, and
could reduce our profits and the profits of third-party hotel proprietors. Wage inflation also adversely affects our margins,
and we are experiencing higher than usual increases in wages in some countries in which we operate.

Additionally, employee layoffs and consultancy cost savings, including the collective dismissal procedure at our
central and corporate services in Spain which was implemented at the end of April 2021, may result in less resources
focusing on certain corporate and control areas. We may not be able to meet in full and/or on time the increasing
demands of compliance or control requirements (financial and non-financial) and as such may be exposed to higher risks
of breaching internal procedures, key performance indicators, and even to potential penalties.

**_Our business depends on our relationships with our third-party suppliers and outsourcing partners, and adverse_**
**_changes in these relationships, our inability to enter into new relationships or performance failure by such third-party_**
**_suppliers and outsourcing partners, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results or operations,_**
**_financial condition or prospects._**

We depend on the provision of services by third-party suppliers, such as janitorial service providers, technical
and IT service providers and payment service providers. If any third-party service provider on which we rely in
conducting our business does not satisfactorily perform the services, we in turn may not be able to provide adequate hotel
facilities and services to our customers. Negative publicity or reviews by customers resulting from the actions of
outsourcing partners and third-party suppliers could also have an adverse effect on our reputation and brands.

In addition, adverse changes in any of our relationships with outsourcing partners and third-party suppliers or
the inability to enter into new relationships with these parties, on commercially favorable terms, or at all, could adversely
affect our operations or otherwise cause disruption. Our arrangements with outsourcing partners and third-party suppliers
may not remain in effect on current or similar terms, and the net impact of future pricing options may adversely affect
our financial position and results of operations. In particular, we depend on a limited number of third-party maintenance
service, IT service and payment service providers. On January 13, 2014, we entered into a framework outsourcing
agreement with Accenture Outsourcing Services, S.A.U., under which we have outsourced our accounts payable and
accounts receivable management and general accounting ledger functions that were previously performed internally by
our employees to Accenture's shared service centers located in the Philippines. The loss or expiration of any of our
contracts with these service providers and the inability to negotiate replacement contracts with alternative service
providers at comparable rates or to enter into such contracts in any of our markets could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results or operations, financial condition or prospects.

**_Our loyalty program is operated by a third party and failure of such third party to effectively run the program or a_**
**_change in control of the third party could result in reputational damage and adversely affect our business results._**

Our loyalty program is a key aspect of our customer relationship management strategy. We are in the process of
migrating our loyalty program from NH Rewards to Global Hotel Alliance ("GHA"). For this purpose, on February 28,

54


-----

2021, we signed an agreement with GHA, operator of the multi-brand hotel loyalty program DISCOVERY, whereby, in
early 2022, we will join the alliance and outsource the NH Hotel Group Rewards loyalty program and its loyalty platform
operation to GHA. Under the terms of the agreement, the resulting loyalty program will be called NH DISCOVERY and
we will retain ownership of the database and the information on NH DISCOVERY and its participants.

This migration seeks to increase the visibility of our loyalty program, attract new and repeat customers and
strengthen our guest database. However, our new loyalty program may not achieve these objectives or meet our
expectations and the underlying business plan. Additionally, as a result of the multi-brand nature of the hotel loyalty
program DISCOVERY, we may suffer reputational harm as a result of actions, circumstances or events related to GHA
or to other members of the alliance. In addition, all members of the alliance have a shared value proposition, which may
lead our customers to choose, to our detriment, other hotel brands that are also part of the loyalty program.

Moreover, our agreement with GHA includes a change of control provision whereby GHA is entitled to
terminate the existing membership and outsourcing relationship based on the occurrence of a change of control. In this
case we would be forced to relaunch our previous loyalty program or join an alternative multi-brand loyalty platform and
the process may damage our reputation and weaken our guest database.

In addition, under our agreement with GHA, we will rely on GHA to manage our guest database. Theft, loss,
fraudulent or unlawful use of customer data could harm our reputation and result in remedial and other costs, fines and
lawsuits, which may be material. In particular, cybersecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our
information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer. See "Risks relating to
_our business and industry—Information technology system failures, delays in the operation of our information_
_technology systems or system enhancement failures could reduce our net turnover and profits and harm the reputation of_
_our brand and our business" and "Risks relating to our business and industry—Failure to maintain the integrity or_
_privacy of internal or customer data, including as a result of cyber security breaches, could result in faulty business_
_decisions, harm to our reputation and subject us to costs, fines and lawsuits"._

**_Negotiations of collective bargaining agreements, regular or statutory consultation processes with employee_**
**_representatives such as works councils, collective dismissals or changes in labor legislation could disrupt our_**
**_operations, increase our personnel expenses or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our_**
**_business strategies._**

Certain of our hotels or the hotels we manage are subject to collective bargaining agreements and similar
agreements or regulations enforced by governmental authorities. We are also required to consult with our employee
representatives, such as works councils, with respect to certain matters. If relationships with our employees or employees
employed by the hotel proprietor of a hotel we manage, other field personnel or the unions that represent them become
adverse (as result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example), we could experience labor disruptions, such as
strikes, lockouts and public demonstrations in our hotels. Labor disruptions, which are generally more likely when
collective bargaining agreements are being renegotiated, could harm our relationship with our employees or cause us to
lose guests if we are unable to provide adequate services. Additionally, labor regulation could lead to higher wage and
benefit costs, changes in work rules that raise operating expenses, legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability
of third- party hotel proprietors to take cost saving measures during economic downturns. We do not have the ability to
control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by third-party hotel
proprietors.

We may also experience difficulty or be liable to pay employees additional amounts in connection with their
termination if the employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a works council or
union. As a result, this may reduce our flexibility to terminate employment arrangements with our employees on terms
that are favorable to us, or without additional termination costs. In addition, from time to time, the terms of a collective
dismissal that we have agreed directly with employee representatives may be challenged by employees. During an
economic downturn, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we may be forced to implement a collective dismissal
which could adversely affect us. For example, we announced in February 2021 our intention to initiate a collective
dismissal procedure in our central and corporate services in Spain, as the first step of our global cost-savings plan. On
March 25, 2021, the agreement reached was announced in the framework of the collective dismissal procedure and
ratified after the Workers' Assembly on March 29, 2021. As of March 31, 2021, in connection with this collective
dismissal procedure, the Company has accrued severance costs of €3.1. million and NH Hoteles España, S.A. has accrued
severance costs of €2.3 million (excluding severance payments without retention awards and other training payments).
This collective dismissal was implemented at the end of April 2021.

In addition, certain amendments in local labor legislation, that may arise from the COVID-19 pandemic, could
have a negative impact on our business (for example, any limitations on dismissals during or after the pandemic).

**_We depend upon our senior executives and key field personnel to manage our business, and the departure of such_**
**_personnel or the failure to recruit and retain additional personnel could adversely affect our business._**

Our ability to maintain our competitive position depends to a large degree on the efforts and skills of our senior
executives who have extensive experience and knowledge of the hotel industry. We have entered into employment
agreements with certain of our senior executives. However, we cannot guarantee that our senior executives will remain
with us. Finding suitable replacements for our senior executives could be difficult. Losing the services of one or more of
these senior executives could adversely affect our strategic relationships, including relationships with third-party hotel
proprietors and vendors, and limit our ability to execute our business strategies. We do not have non-compete agreements
with any of our senior executives, but we maintain "key man" life insurance for our senior executives. See
"Management".

We also rely on the general managers at each of our owned, leased and managed properties to run daily
operations and oversee our employees. Our general managers are trained professionals in the hospitality industry and
have extensive experience in many markets worldwide. Competition for personnel is intense, and we may not be able to
attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in the future. The failure to retain, train or successfully
manage the general managers for our properties could negatively affect our operations.

**_Currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and impact our_**
**_profit and loss statement and we may be unable to repatriate cash and affect asset valuation and profit and loss._**

We are subject to foreign exchange risk because our net turnover in each region is generated in the local
currencies of the region. Conducting business in currencies other than the euro subjects us to fluctuations in currency
exchange rates that could have a negative effect on our financial results. We translate the value of foreign currency
denominated amounts into euro and we report our consolidated financial results of operations in euro. Our net turnover
and expenses in other currencies could significantly increase or decrease as the value of the euro fluctuates relative to
other currencies. Our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will continue to grow if the relative
contribution of our operations outside the Eurozone increases. In particular, the results of our Latin America Business
Unit in 2017 were negatively affected by the depreciation of the Argentine Peso and the Mexican Peso against the euro.
Should we continue to incur foreign currency losses and/or decide to exit from certain countries in Latin America, we
may face difficulties in repatriating cash as a result of restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under
applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions or foreign currency exchange regulations which may have an impact
on net profit. As an example, the Central Bank of Argentina ("BCRA") has imposed measures to favor stability of the
Argentinean peso ("ARS"), where companies will need to request the BCRA's permission to have access to the currency
market, and remit dividends and other sorts of payments abroad, so that may limit the repatriation of our cash from
Argentina, and the protection of our cash against depreciation and inflation.

**_If an economy in which we operate, becomes hyperinflationary, our results could be negatively affected._**

If we operated in a hyperinflationary economy, according to IAS 29, we should restate the financial statements
of those companies with the affected functional currency. This process of restatement could result on a gain or loss on net
monetary position. This gain or loss on the net monetary position may be derived as the difference resulting from the
restatement of non-monetary assets, owners' equity and items in the statement of comprehensive income items and the
adjustment of index linked assets and liabilities. Restatement of fixed asset could lead to a potential asset impairment as a
consequence of the increase of the assets value. If we held an excess of monetary assets over monetary liabilities during
this situation, we could have a loss on the net monetary position. Argentina became a hyperinflationary economy during
2018. Subsequently, the financial statements as of and for the period ended September 30, 2018 onwards are prepared
applying IAS 29 to Argentinian subsidiaries. The application of this standard has not had a significant impact on our
financial statements, but may have such an impact in the years ahead due to the macroeconomic situation in Argentina.

**_The extensive regulatory requirements to which we are subject could increase our costs and give rise to liabilities,_**
**_reduce our margins and cash flow and impact our ability to run our business._**

We are subject to numerous laws and regulations, as well as licensing requirements, in the jurisdictions in which
we operate, including those relating to liquor and alcohol licenses, construction permits and authorizations, land use and
zoning permits, food and beverage regulations, tax, competition and employment laws and regulations. In addition, we
may be required to maintain or renew existing licenses or permits, or acquire new licenses or permits, for our business or
operations. Compliance with applicable rules and regulations and related dialogue with regulatory authorities may
involve significant costs and management resources. For more information, see "Business—Regulation".

Our operations and the properties we own, lease, manage and develop are also subject to extensive
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations of various governments, including requirements addressing:

56


-----

    - air and drinking water quality;

    - fire protection;

    - the use, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, such as heating fuels, cleaning
products, batteries and refrigerants;

    - the disposal of solid waste materials, such as refuse or sewage; and

    - air emissions, including greenhouse gases.

Complying with environmental or other laws and regulations, including any permits or licenses required under
those laws, or addressing liabilities or violations arising under them, could increase our environmental costs, require us to
incur capital expenditures, reduce our profits or limit our ability to run our business. Existing environmental laws and
regulations may be revised, or new laws and regulations adopted, related to global climate change, air quality or other
environmental, health and safety concerns that increase our costs of compliance or subject us to new liability risks. We
could also be subject to liability for the costs of investigating or remediating hazardous substances or wastes on, under or
in real property we currently or formerly manage, own, lease or develop, or third-party sites where we sent hazardous
substances or waste for disposal, regardless of whether we knew of, or were at fault in connection with, the presence or
release of any hazardous or toxic substances or waste. The presence or release of hazardous or toxic substances or waste,
or the failure to properly clean up such materials, could cause us to incur significant costs, jeopardize our ability to
develop, use, sell or rent real property we own or operate or to borrow using such property as collateral and/or result in
claims for personal injury or property damages.

In addition, we may be required to manage, abate or remove materials containing hazardous substances such as
mold, lead or asbestos during demolitions, renovations or remodeling at properties that we manage, own, lease or
develop. The costs related to such management, abatement, removal or related permitting could be substantial.

**_We may review our financial policy or commercial strategy in the context of our integration with MINT_**

As a result of the acquisition by MINT of a controlling interest in the Issuer, the Issuer and its subsidiaries have
become part of a wider group. In the context of the continuing integration process, MINT could influence the financial
policy of the Issuer by increasing its leverage, changing its dividend policy and/or asset disposals or growth strategy.
While the Issuer has been operating fully independent financially since the acquisition, the Issuer and MINT have taken
advantage of certain commercial opportunities. For example, we entered into an agreement with Covivio for the
operation of eight hotels which are being operated by us under the Anantara (being a Minor Hotels brand which we are
licensed to use under our master licensing agreement with agreement with Minor Hotels, a MINT affiliate), NH
Collection and NH brands. In connection with this agreement, the Group signed a long term sustainable lease contract
with Covivio and acquired from Covivio the operating companies that operate the eight hotels with an investment of €50
million. Although additional commercial and branding opportunities have been temporarily suspended due to the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic, we plan to seek additional integration opportunities in the future. Such commercial
opportunities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, or if disagreements arise between the Group and Minor Hotels,
this may negatively impact our relationship with MINT, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.

**_A change of control of the Issuer could result in disruption of certain of our contractual arrangements._**

Certain of our contractual agreements, including agreements relating to the operation of hotels and financing
agreements, contain change-of-control, anti-assignment and other provisions that may be triggered by a change of control
of the Issuer, and such an event may trigger the payment of penalties, early amortization, termination rights, indemnity
obligations under these contracts and potential tax losses in certain regions. In addition, our agreement with Global Hotel
Alliance (“GHA”) includes a change of control provision whereby GHA is entitled to terminate the existing membership
and outsourcing relationship of our loyalty program based on the occurrence of a change of control. Moreover, upon the
occurrence of certain change of control events as described in the Indenture, we will be required to offer to repurchase all
the Notes, at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, and additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. Likewise, upon such change of control
events, we would be required to repay or offer to repay certain of our other indebtedness, including the Senior Secured
RCF and the COVID Related ICO Facilities. See "Risks relating to the Notes and our structure—We may not be able to
_raise the funds necessary to finance and offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting_
_a change of control as required by the Indenture, and the change of control provisions contained in the Indenture may_
_not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events"._

57


-----

A change of control might take place, for example, if MINT decided to partially or totally dispose of its interest
in the Issuer, or in the framework of certain liquidation or dissolution proceedings involving the Issuer.

**_We are subject to changes in tax laws and tax rates in the markets in which we operate, and we may be subject to_**
**_significant claims related to future tax disputes and audits. In addition, any change in the business performance could_**
**_have a potential impact on the recoverability of tax assets._**

Our hotels that are profitable are subject to profit and income tax and other applicable taxes, such as property
tax. There is no guarantee that tax laws or tax rates may not be changed in the future.

There are a number of factors that may adversely impact the our future effective tax rates, such as: (i) the
jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; (ii) changes in the valuation of our deferred tax
assets and liabilities; (iii) adjustments to provisional taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; (iv) adjustments to the
interpretation of transfer pricing standards; (v) changes in available tax credits; (vi) changes in IFRS; and (vii) changes in
tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws.

We have recorded in our consolidated financial statements tax assets of €132 million in connection with certain
tax losses and credits pending to be refunded or applied. Such value has been determined in compliance with the
applicable accounting rules. As of December 31, 2020, the registration is supported by, among other things, our estimates
of future taxable income. Should our future results materially deviate from such estimates, accounting rules will require
us to register an impairment of such tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
business and results of operations.

We are subject to various judicial tax proceedings and tax audits in respect of our operations in Italy, Germany,
the Netherlands, and Colombia.

In particular, we are subject to a tax audit with tax authorities in respect of our operations in Germany which is
at an early stage as of the date of this Offering Memorandum.

We estimate the total potential tax liability related to the judicial proceedings, including penalties and interest, to
be approximately €19 million (including potential tax liabilities of €0.4 million in Italy, €12.9 million in the Netherlands,
€4.0 million in Germany, and €1.7 million in Colombia. In connection with these proceedings, we have made provisions
in our financial statements of €0.4 million. Furthermore, we may be subject to additional tax related claims in the future.
Tax proceedings pose a significant amount of unpredictability and, as a result, we cannot forecast the outcome of any of
these proceedings, when they may be resolved or the final amounts that may be payable in connection therewith. As of
December 31, 2020, other than the provisions specified above, we have not recorded any additional reserves in relation to
such disputes. If all or a significant portion of the current actions are decided against us or in the future a significant
number of similar actions were decided against us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition or prospects.

**_If the insurance that we carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other potential losses involving our hotels, our_**
**_margins and cash flow could be reduced._**

We currently carry insurance that we believe is adequate for foreseeable losses and with terms and conditions
that are reasonable and customary. Nevertheless, market forces beyond our control (such as the COVID-19 pandemic)
could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we can obtain in the future or restrict our ability to continue to buy
insurance coverage at reasonable rates. Insurance premiums may increase substantially in the future and may be affected
by natural catastrophes, fear of terrorism, epidemics or pandemics, intervention by the government or a decrease in the
number of insurance carriers. In addition, insurance providers may raise the insurance premiums we pay if our paid
claims are high, as compared to the premiums we pay. The recent disruption in the financial markets makes it more
difficult to evaluate the stability of insurance companies or their ability to meet their payment obligations. In the event of
a substantial loss, the insurance coverage that we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial
obligations or the replacement cost of any lost investment.

Certain types of losses that are significantly uncertain can be uninsurable or too expensive to insure or can only
be insured with limited coverage. As an example, in June 2017, we put in place a Loss of Attraction insurance policy
with the Lloyds Market in London. This insurance policy will indemnify us for the loss of gross profit of owned and
leased hotels as a consequence of terrorist attacks in certain top European cities. The cover period is six months after the
terrorist event and a deductible/retention, as well as maximum indemnification, applies. Some perils, such as direct
damages and liabilities related to terrorist attacks or civil disorders or violence directly affecting our hotels, may not be
covered by insurance, or are covered by insufficient limits, therefore potentially generating unexpected losses. If an

58


-----

uninsured loss were to occur, we could experience significant disruption to our operations, suffer significant losses and
be required to make significant payments for which we would not be compensated, any of which in turn could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects. Alternatively, we could
lose some or all the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future net turnover from the
property. We could also remain obligated for performance guarantees in favor of third-party hotel proprietors. We may
not have sufficient insurance to cover awards of damages resulting from our liabilities. If the insurance that we carry does
not sufficiently cover damages or other losses, our profits could be adversely affected. In addition, in the event of any
significant claims by us, our insurance premiums may increase significantly.

**_Any failure to protect our trademarks and intellectual property could reduce the value of our brand and harm our_**
**_business._**

The reputation and perception of our brand is critical to our success in the hotel industry. If our trademarks,
intellectual property or know-how are copied or used without authorization, the value of our brand, our reputation, our
competitive advantage and our goodwill could be harmed. We regularly apply to register our trademarks in the countries
in which we operate. However, those trademark registrations may not be granted or the steps we take to protect our
trademarks, intellectual property or know-how in these countries may not be adequate to prevent others, including third
parties or former employees, from copying or using our trademarks, intellectual property or know-how without
authorization. Our intellectual property and know-how are also vulnerable to unauthorized use in some countries where
local law may not adequately protect it.

Monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and know-how is difficult. As we have done in the
past, we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could be costly,
force us to divert our resources, lead to counterclaims or other claims against us or otherwise harm our business. Any
failure to maintain and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property and know-how could reduce the value of
our brand and harm our business.

**_Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in the_**
**_normal course of our business could reduce our cash flow, harm our financial position and limit our ability to operate_**
**_our business._**

In the normal course of our business, we and our directors, employees and other related parties are often
involved in various legal proceedings, arbitration proceedings, investigations, or administrative proceedings, which may
involve substantial claims for damages or other payments. The outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted. If any
of these proceedings were to be determined adversely to us or a settlement involving a payment of a material sum of
money were to occur, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Additionally, we could become the subject of future claims by third parties, including current or former third-party hotel
owners, guests who use our properties, employees, investors, other contractual parties or regulators. In particular,
third-party hotel proprietors may bring claims against us (or we may initiate such claims) in connection with the
implementation of our exit from underperforming leases and undesirable management agreements or in connection with
certain strategies implemented during and following COVID-19 pandemic, which could harm our reputation and impede
our ability to enter into lease and management agreements in the future. Such claims have increased during the pandemic.
Any adverse litigation judgments or settlements may distract management from our business activities, require us to
change the way we conduct our operational or investment activities and may make it necessary to use substantial
resources to settle claims, pay fines or other penalties, any of which may reduce our cash flow and harm our financial
position and could limit our ability to operate our business. In addition, costs related to such proceedings may be
significant and, even if there is a positive outcome, we may have to bear part or all of our advisory and other costs to the
extent they are not reimbursable by other parties. See "Business—Legal proceedings."

**_Our former significant shareholder has brought a claim before the courts, which could be decided in a manner_**
**_unfavorable to our interests and could affect the composition of our corporate bodies._**

Hesperia filed a claim against us before the Commercial Court of Madrid no. 8 (the "Hesperia Claim"), pursuant
to which Hesperia seeks the annulment of certain of the resolutions passed by the meeting of the board of directors of the
Issuer held on June 12, 2018, including the appointment of Dillipraj Rajakarier as proprietary member of the board of
directors and the dismissal of José Antonio Castro Sousa as member and chairman of the executive committee of the
board of directors. On October 10, 2018, the Commercial Court of Madrid no. 8 admitted the Hesperia Claim, and on
November 12, 2018, we filed the relevant writ of defense arguing against, and requesting the full dismissal of, the
Hesperia Claim.

59


-----

The hearing took place on the September 17, 2019, and the Court will have to resolve the claim, either by
indicating a trial date, or by dismissing the claim. A new preliminary hearing took place on April 13, 2021, scheduling
the main hearing on February 8, 2022. A first instance judgment is expected in the first half of 2022.

**_Changes in U.S. or other countries' foreign policy could subject us to increased compliance costs and may_**
**_otherwise affect our results of operations_**

The implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by judicial
or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs. For example, the U.S. Government
announced in May 2019 that it will no longer suspend the right of private parties to bring litigation under Title III of the
Cuban Liberty and Solidarity (Libertad) Act of 1996, otherwise known as the Helms-Burton Act, which allows certain
individuals whose property was confiscated by the Cuban government beginning in 1959 to bring claims against anyone
who "traffics" in the property in question in U.S. courts. On September 27, 2019, a lawsuit was filed against the
Company and NH Hotels, USA, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York under the HelmsBurton Act. The complaint, filed by a family trust, alleges an interest in the Hotel Capri, located in Havana, Cuba, which
was expropriated by the Cuban Government. The complaint further alleges that NH Hotel Group "trafficked" in that
property by generating revenues and obtaining profits and other financial benefits. The plaintiff sought $2,033,959.17 in
damages and requested that such damages be trebled, plus 6% interest from January 1, 1959, as well as attorneys' fees
and costs as determined by the court. While the claim was ultimately dropped in February 2020, we believe that we had a
meritorious defense to the claim and that, in any case, should the claim have succeeded, the results of the litigation would
not have been material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, litigation is uncertain and
there is little case law or interpretation of the relevant claims and defenses. As a result, there can be no assurance that
there will not be an adverse outcome to any such similar litigation in the future or that such an outcome would not result
in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_Information technology system failures, delays in the operation of our information technology systems or system_**
**_enhancement failures could reduce our net turnover and profits and harm the reputation of our brand and our_**
**_business._**

Our success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our information technology systems. For
example, we depend on technology for our central reservation system, which facilitates bookings by hotels directly, by
telephone through our call centers, by travel agents, online through our website, and through our online reservations
partners. In addition, we depend on information technology to run our day-to-day operations, including hotel services and
amenities such as guest check-in and check-out, housekeeping and room service and to track and report financial results
of our hotels and the Group.

As we migrated our systems to SAP and other IT tools, we could have experienced delays and disruptions, as
well as other operational difficulties that are inherent in such a transition, and we may be exposed to similar difficulties in
the event we implement other technology updates. Our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or
interruption from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins and
similar events. In particular, cybersecurity attacks have increased significantly in recent years, particularly since the start
of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in February 2021, our operations in Portugal were the subject of a
cybersecurity attack and certain files were encrypted; while we successfully decrypted the affected files, there is no
assurance that we will be able to do so if we affected by similar cybersecurity attacks in the future, especially given the
increasing sophistication of such attacks. In addition, the occurrence of any such natural disasters or unanticipated
problems at any of our information technology facilities or any of our call centers could cause interruptions or delays in
our business or loss of data, or render us unable to process reservations and, depending on the nature of the incident, it
could take time to restart our information technology systems.

Furthermore, if our information technology systems are unable to provide the information communications
capacity that we need, or if our information technology systems suffer problems caused by installing system
enhancements, we could experience similar failures or interruptions. If our information technology systems fail and our
redundant systems or disaster recovery plans are not adequate to address such failures, the reputation of our brand and
our business could be harmed. If our property and business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for
any losses that we may incur, our net turnover and cash flow could be reduced. As we increase the digitization of our
operations, our exposure to such risks could increase.

While we have certain security measures in place (including back-up systems and an emergency recovery plan),
such measures may not be sufficient to protect us against risks to our technology systems, especially given the fastevolving nature of information technology systems and the increasing sophistication of threats to information security.
Our exposure to such risks may increase as we continue the digitalization of our business.

**_Failure to maintain the integrity or privacy of internal or customer data, including as a result of cybersecurity_**
**_breaches, could result in faulty business decisions, harm to our reputation and subject us to costs, fines and lawsuits._**

We collect and retain large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card numbers and other
personally identifiable information during the normal course of business. Using our various information technology
systems, we enter, process, summarize and report such data. We also collect and retain information about our customers
who participate in our NH Hotel Group Rewards loyalty program, including their names, telephone numbers, e-mail
addresses, nationality and country of residence. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our
employees. The integrity and protection of our customer, employee and company data is critical to our business. Our
customers and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information according to the applicable
data protection regulations, and the regulations applicable to security and privacy is increasingly demanding in certain
jurisdictions where we operate. In this regard, on May 25, 2018, the new general data protection regulation (the "GDPR")
came into force in the European Union. The regulation provides for a harmonized regime of data protection and privacy
for all individuals throughout the European Union with the aim of giving back control to citizens and residents over their
personal data. The GDPR includes a new strict penalty regime. In this regard, should the competent authority consider
that we do not comply with the new regulation, it may impose penalties of up to 4% of the worldwide turnover or €20
million, whichever is higher, and such determination would harm our reputation, our financial position and could result
in legal claims or proceedings being brought against us.

Theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of customer, employee or company data could harm our reputation and
result in remedial and other costs, fines and lawsuits, which may be material. In particular, cyber security breaches and
other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and
reputation to suffer. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to
attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could
compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such
access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and regulatory penalties, could
disrupt our operations and could damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, operating margins,
revenues and competitive position. Cybersecurity attacks have increased significantly in recent years, particularly since
the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and such attacks may involve data breaches. For example, in February 2021, our
operations in Portugal were the subject of a cybersecurity attack and certain files were encrypted; while we successfully
decrypted the affected files, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so if we affected by similar cybersecurity
attacks in the future, and that such attacks may lead to internal or customer data being compromised, especially given the
increasing sophistication of such attacks.

As an organization that handles credit cards and debit cards from major card schemes such as Visa, MasterCard
and American Express, we are required by these card schemes to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security
Standard ("PCI DSS"), a security standard aimed at increasing controls around cardholder data to reduce credit card
fraud. If we are found not to be compliant with PCI DSS in the event of a security breach, we may be subject to penalties
such as fines or restrictions or bans from using such card schemes for our operations.

Additionally, we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including email marketing, online advertising
and postal mailings. Restrictions regarding marketing and solicitation or new and more restrictive data protection laws
that govern these activities could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of our marketing strategy.

In addition, while we believe we have integrated client personal data bases belonging to MINT and the Group in
compliance with all applicable personal data regulation, should the systems and technical applications supporting this
integration not meet applicable legal requirements, we could be exposed to the penalties described above.

**_An adverse outcome of certain investigations by competition authorities regarding "parity clauses" could affect our_**
**_business._**

We are subject to laws and regulations regarding competition in the markets where we operate. In particular, in
the past few years, competition authorities of certain EU Member States, have been investigating online travel agencies
("OTAs") for their pricing practices in the hotel industry, with a particular focus on clauses in contractual arrangements
with hotel operators providing for "parity". Pursuant to such parity clauses, which are sometimes included in our
contractual arrangements with OTAs, hotel operators are generally required, with certain flexibility which may vary on a
case by case basis, not to offer either in their web site or through other distributors hotel rates lower than those offered to
the relevant OTA. Some of the mentioned authorities have maintained that certain parity clauses have a negative impact
on competition, and have requested certain OTAs to remove them from their contractual arrangements with hotel
operators. In the last few years, the EU Commission and several national competition authorities within the EU have
been monitoring the potential impact on competition of parity rates provisions in the online booking sector. Such

61


-----

monitoring process continues at the present time and a potential unfavorable outcome of current investigations or future
ones could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

**_If we fail to stay current with developments in technology necessary for our business, our operations could be harmed_**
**_and our ability to compete effectively could be diminished._**

Sophisticated information technology and other systems, including systems used for our central reservations,
revenue management, property management and our NH Hotel Group Rewards loyalty program, as well as technology
systems that we make available to our guests, are integral to our business. Our information technology and other systems
must be refined, updated or replaced with more advanced systems on a regular basis. Developing and maintaining our
systems may require significant capital. If we are unable to replace or introduce information technology and other
systems as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs or schedules when these systems become outdated or
need replacing, or if we are unable to achieve the intended benefits of any new information technology or other systems,
our operations could be harmed and our ability to compete effectively could be diminished.

**_Third-party claims that we infringe third-party intellectual property rights could subject us to damages and other costs_**
**_and expenses._**

Third parties may make claims against us for infringing their intellectual property rights. Any such claims, even
those without merit, could:

    - be expensive and time consuming to defend;

    - force us to stop providing products or services that use the intellectual property that is being
challenged;

    - divert our management's attention and resources;

    - force us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to obtain the right to use a third party's intellectual
property; or

    - force us to pay significant damages.

In addition, we may be required to indemnify third-party proprietors of the hotels we manage and intellectual
property societies for any losses they incur as a result of any such infringement claims. Any necessary royalty or
licensing agreements may not be available to us on acceptable terms. Any costs, lost net turnover, changes to our
business or diversion of management attention related to intellectual property claims against us, whether successful or
not, could adversely affect our business and financial results.

**_Potential future changes in accounting standards may impact reporting of our performance and our financial_**
**_position._**

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union.
Future changes in accounting standards or practices and related legal and regulatory interpretations of those changes, may
adversely impact our business and industry. For example, IFRS 16 "Leases" has replaced the IAS 17 standard, which
imposes significant changes to lease accounting practice. IFRS 16 states that, from January 1, 2019, companies must
generally record operating leases in their consolidated statement of financial position. The implementation of this new
standard led to an increase of the consolidated statement of financial position (assets and liabilities) due to the
recognition of the right to use the leased asset and any future payment commitments related thereto affecting gross
indebtedness and, therefore, the calculation of all the financial ratios relating to indebtedness. However, it does not have
any effect on cash flows. Given that we have a significant number of operating leases, the changes in lease accounting
have had a material impact on our financial results, including our rental expense, depreciation, interest expense,
indebtedness and balance sheet. Another example is the amendment to IFRS 16 that was approved by the IASB on
May 28, 2020 to help accounting for changes in leases resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing rent
concessions related to the pandemic to be recorded as less rent expense instead of as a lease amendment. However, there
can be no assurance that IASB will adopt amendments to IFRS in the future in a timely manner, or at all, to address any
new situations which may arise, or that any such amendments will be practical for the Group. Any failure to do so could
adversely affect our accounting and financial results.

**Risks relating to the Notes and our structure**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from_**
**_fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees._**

As of March 31, 2021, as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the Transactions, we would have had
€1,051 million of indebtedness (excluding operating lease liabilities and the Shareholder Loan), of which €400.0 million
would have been represented by the Notes. See "Capitalization". We anticipate that our substantial indebtedness will
continue for the foreseeable future. Our substantial indebtedness may have important negative consequences for you,
including:

    - making it more difficult for us and our subsidiaries to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt,
including the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and other liabilities;

    - requiring that a substantial portion of the cash flow from operations of our operating subsidiaries be
dedicated to debt service obligations, reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital and
capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes;

    - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, economic downturns
affecting our industry;

    - exposing us to interest rate increases;

    - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as
highly leveraged;

    - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business, the competitive
environment and our industry;

    - restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions, joint ventures, expansion projects or exploiting
certain business opportunities; and

    - limiting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries' ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity
capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt
obligations, including the Notes. In the worst case, an actual or impending inability by us or our subsidiaries to pay debts
as they become due and payable could result in our insolvency.

**_The terms of the Indenture and the terms and conditions governing the Senior Secured RCF and the COVID Related_**
**_ICO Facilities place restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries, reducing our operational flexibility._**

The terms of the Indenture and the terms and conditions governing the Senior Secured RCF and COVID Related
ICO Facilities contain covenants that place restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries. The covenants under our
financing arrangements restrict, among other things, our ability to:

    - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

    - make certain other restricted payments and investments;

    - pay dividends or make other distributions;

    - create or incur liens;

    - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or
advances to and on the transfer of assets to the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries;

    - transfer or sell assets;

    - impair the security interest in the Collateral;

    - merge or consolidate with other entities; and

63


-----

    - enter into certain transactions with affiliates.

All these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. For example, in the Senior Secured RCF,
during the period commencing on October 16, 2020 until December 31, 2021, our ability to make capital expenditure
disbursements, acquisitions or other investments resulting in cash-out is limited to an amount equal to €70,000,000 plus
the amount of net proceeds of asset sales, if any. The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance
our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our
interest. For a detailed description of the covenants and restrictions imposed by the documents governing our
indebtedness, see "Description of certain financing arrangements" and "Description of the Notes".

A breach of any of the covenants, ratios, tests or restrictions in the Indenture, the Senior Secured RCF or the
COVID Related ICO Facilities could result in an event of default thereunder. In the context of a severe cash flow
deterioration due to unexpected business interruptions (such as a pandemic), we may breach these covenants if the cash
flow deterioration is sustained for a time. See "—We may not meet certain financial ratios and levels imposed on us
_under the Senior Secured RCF or the COVID Related ICO Facilities"._

Any default under the Indenture, the Senior Secured RCF or the COVID Related ICO Facilities could lead to an
event of default under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the
Indenture, the Senior Secured RCF or the COVID Related ICO Facilities . If our creditors, including the creditors under
the Indenture, the Senior Secured RCF and the COVID Related ICO Facilities, accelerate the payment of amounts
outstanding under such agreements, our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries may not be sufficient to repay in full
those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to
enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. If we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could enforce any
collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts, including the Collateral.

**_We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and for other general corporate purposes, and our ability_**
**_to generate sufficient cash depends upon many factors beyond our control._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our debt, including the Notes, the Senior
Secured RCF and the COVID Related ICO Facilities, and to fund working capital and capital expenditures, will depend
on our future operating performance and our ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends, to some extent, on general
economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors, as well as the other factors
discussed in these "Risk factors" and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, many of which are beyond our control.

Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, and additional debt and equity financing
may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund
our other liquidity needs. This could mean a refinancing risk that in the context of disrupted financial markets (including
as a result of a pandemic), that may end up resulting in a default. For a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see
_"Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Liquidity"._

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as
they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, or we are otherwise restricted from doing so due to corporate, tax or
contractual limitations, we may be forced to:

    - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

    - sell assets;

    - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

    - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

The type, timing and terms of any future financing will depend upon our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the
financial markets. We may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms,
if at all. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes and the terms and conditions governing the Senior Secured
RCF and the COVID Related ICO Facilities, and any future debt that we may incur, may limit our ability to pursue any
of these alternatives.

64


-----

**_Despite our current substantial indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt in the future, including_**
**_on a secured basis over the Collateral or otherwise, which could further exacerbate the risks of our indebtedness._**

We may incur substantially more debt in the future. Although each of the Indenture, the Senior Secured RCF
and the COVID Related ICO Facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and on the
granting of security in respect thereof, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and
exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these
restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the Indenture, the Senior Secured RCF and the COVID Related ICO
Facilities do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. We
may incur additional debt in the future, secured by the Collateral or otherwise, which could mature prior to the Notes, and
such debt could be secured on an equal, ratable and pari passu basis with the Notes and the Notes Guarantees. Any
additional debt incurred by a non-Guarantor subsidiary would be structurally senior to the Notes. If new debt is added to
our and our subsidiaries' existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase.

**_The Senior Secured RCF and the COVID Related ICO Facilities bear interest at floating rates. A rise in interest rates_**
**_would increase interest costs on the amounts drawn under the Senior Secured RCF and any other variable rate debt_**
**_that we may incur in the future, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to refinance existing debt_**
**_and acquire assets._**

Borrowings under the Senior Secured RCF and the COVID Related ICO Facilities will bear interest at floating
rates equal to EURIBOR plus an additional margin. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future as a result of
a significant rise of EURIBOR. Moreover, a floor of 0% applies to EURIBOR, which means that, should EURIBOR
decrease below 0%, we would not benefit from such decrease. Any increase in the interest rate applicable to borrowings
under the Senior Secured RCF and the COVID Related ICO Facilities will reduce our cash flows available for other
corporate purposes including investments in our hotel portfolio. Further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to
refinance existing debt when it matures and increase interest costs on any refinancing indebtedness. Although we may
from time to time enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps or other interest rate hedging agreements designed to
fix all or part of any such floating interest expense payment, such agreements may not continue to be available on
commercially reasonable terms. While these agreements may reduce the effect of rising floating interest benchmark rates,
they also expose us to the risk that other parties to the agreements will not perform or that the agreements will be
unenforceable. If one or more of our counterparties falls into bankruptcy, claims we may have under such interest rate
hedging agreements may become worthless. In addition, in the event that we refinance our debt or terminate hedging
agreements, we may be required to make termination payments, which would result in a cash outflow. An increase in
floating interest rates could also decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our
ability to dispose of assets as part of our business strategy. For a detailed description of the interest margin and fees
imposed by the documents governing our indebtedness, see "Description of certain financing arrangements".

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law
enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether
the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may
have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other
interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be "benchmarks" are the subject of ongoing national
and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market
Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and
financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016.
Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the
result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be
other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority
announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark
after 2021 and on March 5, 2021 it further confirmed that it intends to cease providing all LIBOR settings for all
currencies, subject to any rights that it has to compel continuation of such publication (the "FCA Announcement"). The
FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed
after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of
administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the
manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or
result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark. Any such change, as well as manipulative
practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which
could have a material adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.

Any elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of EURIBOR, could
require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of our floating rate debt. Any such adjustment could have a material

65


-----

adverse effect on the value of and return on any such floating rate debt. If EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise
unavailable, the interest rate on our floating rate debt will be determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions
applicable to such debt.

**_We operate in a negative interest rate environment, where banks are starting to charge corporate clients for the cash_**
**_balances held in bank accounts, which increases the cost of liquidity._**

Due to the current negative interest rate environment in Europe, banks are starting to charge fees on the cash
balances held by corporate clients in bank accounts. These fees can be as low as -0.50% per annum and they represent a
burden for companies holding cash balances as liquidity.

**_The Issuer is dependent upon payments from its subsidiaries to make payments on the Notes, and the Issuer's_**
**_subsidiaries may not be permitted or otherwise able to make payments to the Issuer._**

The Issuer is a publicly listed parent company that depends upon receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries
to meet its obligations. Even if the Issuer's subsidiaries generate sufficient cash from their operations, their ability to
provide funds to the Issuer are subject to, among other things, local tax restrictions and local corporate law restrictions
related to earnings, the level of legal or statutory reserves, losses from previous years, capitalization requirements for the
Issuer's subsidiaries and contractual restrictions. As a result, although the Group may have sufficient resources, on a
consolidated basis, to make the necessary payments to the Issuer in order for the Issuer to meet its obligations, the
Issuer's subsidiaries may not be able to make the necessary transfers to it to permit the Issuer to satisfy its obligations
under the Notes or otherwise. In particular, the Issuer's subsidiaries may be restricted from providing funds to it under
some circumstances. These circumstances include:

    - restrictions under the corporate law of the jurisdictions in which the Issuer's subsidiaries are based,
which could require, among other things, that its subsidiaries retain a certain percentage of annual net
income in a legal reserve, that its subsidiaries maintain the share capital of a limited liability company
and that, after payment of any dividend, the relevant subsidiary's shareholders' equity exceed its share
capital. For example, Spanish law sets out certain capital requirements which limits our subsidiaries'
ability to provide funds to the Issuer due to restrictions that require, among other things, each of our
Spanish subsidiaries (i) to allocate an amount at least equal to 10% of its annual net income to the legal
reserve until such reserve represents at least 20% of such company's share capital and (ii) to maintain
its equity in an amount not lower than its share capital once the profit distribution is deducted and the
corresponding goodwill reserves are allocated. Moreover, the by-laws of each of our Spanish
subsidiaries may provide for additional reserves that must be retained prior to providing funds to us;

    - restrictions under foreign exchange laws and regulations that could limit or tax the remittance of
dividends or transfer payments abroad; and

    - existing and future contractual restrictions, including restrictions in joint venture agreements, credit
facilities, cash pooling arrangements and other indebtedness that affect the ability of the Issuer's
subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to it in the future.

**_Not all our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes, and each of the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be structurally_**
**_subordinated to the liabilities and preference shares (if any) of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Not all our existing and future subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. As of March 31, 2021, we had total assets
of €4,205.4 million and, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we would have had an aggregate amount of
€1,051 million of total indebtedness outstanding (excluding operating lease liabilities and the Shareholder Loan). The
Guarantors comprised 68.6% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020 and represented 84.4% and 73.9% of our net
turnover and EBITDA, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the Issuer and the Guarantors together
comprised 80.5% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020 and represented 86.6% and 83.6% of our net turnover and
EBITDA, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, after giving pro forma effect to the
Transactions, the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer would have had €28.8 million of debt outstanding as of
March 31, 2021 on a consolidated basis. See "Description of certain financing arrangements".

Our non-Guarantor subsidiaries have no obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes or to make funds
available for that purpose. Generally, claims of creditors of a non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, and
claims of preference shareholders, if any, of our subsidiaries, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of
the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including claims under any intercompany loans and by holders of

66


-----

the Notes under the Notes Guarantees. In the event that any of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries becomes insolvent,
liquidates, reorganizes, dissolves, enters examinership or otherwise winds up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

    - the creditors of the Issuer, including the holders of the Notes, and the Guarantors will have no right to
proceed against the assets of the non-Guarantor subsidiary; and

    - creditors of the non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to
payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of the non-Guarantor subsidiary before any
Guarantor or the Issuer, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions
from the non-Guarantor subsidiary.

Consequently, any claim by us or our creditors against a non-Guarantor subsidiary will be structurally subordinated to all
the claims of the creditors of the non-Guarantor subsidiary.

**_The Notes and the Notes Guarantees are secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral, which may not be_**
**_sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees._**

The Collateral will secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees on a first-ranking basis (with the sole exception
of the Collateral over the NH Italia Shares which will secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees on a second ranking
basis) and will also secure, on a first-ranking basis, the Senior Secured RCF. Subject to certain limits, the Senior Secured
RCF and the Indenture permit additional debt to be secured by the Collateral, and such additional secured debt may be
substantial. The rights of a holder of Notes to the Collateral may be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the
Collateral or a reduction of the Collateral securing the Notes.

If there is an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, on the Notes, there is no guarantee that the proceeds
of any sale of the Collateral will be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due under the Notes
as well as other debt benefiting from a pari passu security interest in the Collateral, including indebtedness under the
Senior Secured RCF. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and
the Notes Guarantees, holders, to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral, would have only an
unsecured claim against the Issuer's and the Guarantors' remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the
validity of the Collateral or the Intercreditor Agreement could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the
Collateral. The amount of proceeds realized upon the enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral or in the
event of liquidation will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an
orderly sale, economic conditions where operations are located and the availability of buyers. Furthermore, there may not
be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business or pledged subsidiaries, either individually or collectively. The
book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. Moreover, all or a
portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. There may not be a market
for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, there may be a substantial delay in its liquidation. The Share
Collateral may be of no value if our subsidiary whose shares have been pledged is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy
proceeding.

The companies for which Share Collateral has been granted may have outstanding indebtedness or may have
granted security over their assets to secure other debt. For example, as of March 31, 2021, NH Italia has €0.4 million of
outstanding indebtedness which was secured by a mortgage over NH Villa San Mauro, Jolly Hotels USA has an
unsecured $50 million loan and NH Italia S.p.A. has an unsecured €15.0 million loan which was signed in October 2020
and is guaranteed by the Italian government (SACE guarantee).

In addition, our business requires a variety of permits and licenses. The continued operation of properties that
comprise part of the Collateral and that depend upon the maintenance of the permits and licenses may be prohibited or
restricted. In the event of foreclosure, the grant of permits and licenses may be revoked, the transfer of the permits and
licenses may be prohibited or may require us to incur significant cost and expense. Further, the applicable governmental
authorities may not consent to the transfer of all permits and licenses. If the regulatory approvals required for the
transfers are not obtained, are delayed or are economically prevented, the foreclosure may be delayed, a temporary or
lasting shutdown of operations may result, and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased.

In the future, the obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over assets, or a
particular type or class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries, the
designation of a previously unrestricted subsidiary as a restricted subsidiary or otherwise, is subject to certain agreed
security principles and the Intercreditor Agreement. The agreed security principles set out a number of limitations on the
rights of the holders of the Notes to require granting of, or payment or enforcement under, a guarantee or security in
certain circumstances. The operation of the agreed security principles may result in, among other things, the amount
recoverable under any guarantee or security provided by any subsidiary being limited or security not being granted over a

67


-----

particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the agreed security principles may affect the value of the Notes
Guarantees and Collateral provided by us and our subsidiaries. The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees
and Collateral may also be affected by local law limitations. See "—The Notes Guarantees and security interests in the
_Collateral are significantly limited by applicable laws and are subject to certain limitations on enforcement or defenses"._

The Mortgage Properties are located in the Netherlands, and the Share Collateral includes a pledge of shares in
subsidiaries incorporated in Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands. The multi-jurisdictional nature of any foreclosure on the
Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Collateral. For example, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative,
examinership and other laws of the various jurisdictions may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other,
including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of government and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition
interest and duration of the proceedings.

**_Our compliance with certain of the covenants under the Indenture may be tested a substantial period of time after the_**
**_last valuation of the Collateral and thus our compliance with the covenants under the Indenture may be based on a_**
**_valuation that does not reflect the current actual value of the Collateral._**

We will furnish to the Trustee, within 180 days after the end of each fiscal year, a valuation report prepared by
an independent appraisal firm setting forth the market value of the Collateral as of the end of the applicable fiscal year.
We may also provide the Trustee with additional valuation reports from time to time throughout the year. The valuations,
together with certain other financial information of the Company, will be used to determine if we can release the
Collateral from time to time. Our compliance with this provision may be tested long after the most recent valuation was
conducted, and accordingly, the value reflected in the last valuation of the Collateral might be substantially different than
the actual value of the Collateral when verifying the compliance with certain covenants. Liens on the Collateral may be
released if, among other things, the loan to value ratio of the Issuer (calculated as the ratio of the aggregate principal
amount of debt secured by the Collateral to the value of the Collateral as determined in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture) as of the date of release is no more than 55%. Under the Indenture, this percentage may increase up to 100%
under certain circumstances. The value for purposes of determining this ratio is the valuation reflected in the most recent
available valuation report, which might be materially different than the actual value of the Collateral as of the date of
release. See "Description of the Notes—Reports" and "Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Security Interests".

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes is subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections permitted under the Senior Secured RCF, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The existence of
any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the
Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral.
Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely
satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens, certain statutory preferences or recharacterization under the laws
of certain jurisdictions.

To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the
Guarantors whose shares form part of the Collateral, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect
to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that
Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent, acting on behalf of the Trustee or investors as holders of the Notes, to
realize or enforce that Collateral. In particular, the Share Collateral includes a pledge over the shares of the capital stock
of NH Italia. Certain properties owned by NH Italia have been granted as security in favor of the relevant lenders under
the outstanding debt of NH Italia. Moreover, the security interests securing the Notes over the NH Italia Shares will be
second-ranking security interests and holders of the Notes will have to rely on the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement for the treatment of such second-ranking security interests as security interests ranking pari passu with other
first-ranking security interests securing the Notes.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the
realization of security interests in the Collateral and there can be no assurance that the Collateral will be saleable. For
example, the enforcement of the Share Collateral, whether by means of a sale, public auction, or judicial or private
appropriation, may be subject to certain specific requirements and the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a
third party to enforce a security interest or to appoint an independent expert to assess the value of the Collateral. The
Security Agent may not be able to obtain the consent of a third party, and the consents of any third parties may not be
given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability
to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

**_Holders of the Notes will not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The Notes will be secured by the same Collateral securing the obligations under the Senior Secured RCF. In
addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other
obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent serves as the Security Agent for the secured
parties under the Notes and the Senior Secured RCF with respect to the shared Collateral. Subject to certain limited
exceptions, the Security Agent will act with respect to such Collateral only at the direction of an "Instructing Group",
which means those creditors whose senior secured credit participations at that time aggregate to more than 66[2]/3% of the
total senior secured credit participations. The senior secured credit participations include among others, the aggregate
liabilities owed to the lenders under the Senior Secured RCF and the aggregate outstanding principal amounts held by the
holders of the Notes, with each lender, holder or other creditor holder exercising its own vote. Upon the issuance of the
Notes, the holders of the Notes are expected to hold approximately 60% of the total senior secured credit participations as
of the Issue Date, and thus will not be able to independently constitute an "Instructing Group".

**_The security interests in the Collateral are not directly granted to the holders of the Notes._**

The security interests in the Collateral that secure, among other obligations, the obligations of the Issuer under
the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes Guarantees are not granted directly to the holders of the
Notes but are granted only in favor of the Security Agent on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes in
accordance with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents related to the Collateral. As a
consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement
action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will, subject to the provisions of
the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral.

In addition, the holders of the Notes will not be able to instruct the Security Agent, force a sale of Collateral or
otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the relevant Security Documents, unless the
holders of the Notes comprise an Instructing Group. Disputes may occur among the holders of the Notes, or among the
holders of the Notes and creditors under the Senior Secured RCF, regarding enforcement remedies and strategies with
respect to the Collateral. In such an event, the holders of the Notes will be bound by any decisions of the Instructing
Group, which may result in enforcement action in respect of the Collateral, whether or not such action is approved by the
holders of the Notes or may be adverse to the holders of the Notes. The creditors under the Senior Secured RCF may
have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes, and they may elect to pursue their remedies
under the Security Documents at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do
so.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells any of the Collateral as a result of an enforcement action in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and the liens over any other assets
securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may be released. See "Description of certain financing arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement" and "Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Security Interests"._

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale of particular assets_**
**_could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive
control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income, dividends and other distributions from the
Collateral. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer and the
Guarantors may, among other things and subject to the terms of the Indenture, without any release or consent by the
Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or
otherwise disposing of the Collateral. Additionally, as part of our day-to-day operations, we actively manage our hotel
portfolio with the aim of exiting from or selling underperforming hotels. As a result, subject to certain limitations set
forth in the Indenture including the requirement that we do not exceed a specified ratio of pari passu debt secured by the
Collateral to the aggregate value of the Collateral determined in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, certain
properties or shares constituting part of the Collateral may be sold or otherwise disposed of and the liens with respect to
such assets would be released such that the Collateral in place as of the Issue Date may be diluted over time. Your ability
to recover on the Notes could be materially impaired in such circumstances.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the security interest in the_**
**_Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be released automatically, without the consent of the_**
**_holders of the Notes or the consent of the Trustee._**

The security interest in the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may be released in certain
circumstances, including in the event the Collateral is sold pursuant to an enforcement sale in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement. Upon any such enforcement sale in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Guarantor's Notes Guarantee may also be released. In addition, we may release the security over that Collateral if, among
other things, we sell or dispose of the Collateral from time to time or subject to the requirement that, among other things,
the loan to value ratio of the Issuer (calculated as the ratio of the aggregate principal amount of debt secured by the
Collateral to the value of the Collateral as determined in accordance with the terms of the Indenture) as of the date of
release is no more than 55%. Under the Indenture, upon redemption of the Notes, this percentage might increase up to
100% under certain circumstances. Moreover, under certain circumstances, the security interests over the Mortgage
Properties may be replaced by security interests over the share capital of the relevant wholly owned subsidiaries of the
Issuer that own the Mortgage Property being released. Any such replacement might negatively affect the value of the
Collateral. See "Description of the Notes—Release of Notes Guarantees" and "Description of the Notes—Security—
_Release of Security Interests"._

**_The Notes and the Notes Guarantees may not be secured by the Collateral on the Issue Date._**

The Security Documents will be entered into on the Issue Date or within five business days thereafter, and the
Notes and the Notes Guarantees may not be secured by the Collateral on the Issue Date. The Issuer has agreed to take all
necessary actions to perfect and make effective the security interest to be granted in favor of the Security Agent (for the
benefit of the holders of the Notes, among others) in the Collateral pursuant to the Security Documents executed on the
Issue Date or within five business days thereafter, subject, in each case, to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and
such Security Documents, as soon as practicable. In addition, the Collateral may be subject to certain perfection
requirements in order to be enforced. Accordingly, although we will endeavor to complete all steps necessary to perfect
the security over the Collateral as soon as practicable, we cannot provide any assurances as to when the security to be
granted over the Collateral to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be perfected, if at all. See "—Your rights in
_the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral or by being second-_
_ranking security interests" and "Description of the Notes—Security—The Collateral"._

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral or_**
**_by being second-ranking security interests._**

The security interests to be granted in respect of the Collateral will not be perfected on the Issue Date. Under
applicable law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained, through
certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor of the security. The liens on the Collateral securing the
Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions required to
perfect any of the liens.

Absent perfection, the holders of the Notes may have difficulty enforcing their rights in the Collateral with
respect to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the
Collateral. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until, but not after, the
debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security provider in favor of the
secured party over the claims the secured party, as creditor, has against the debtor. Finally, since the ranking of pledges is
generally determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a
later date over the same asset constituting the Collateral, but which come into force for third parties earlier, by way of
registration in the appropriate register or by notification, may have priority. In particular, the Collateral over the NH Italia
Shares will be second-ranking and will only be deemed and treated as security interests ranking pari passu with the
security interests securing the Senior Secured RCF under the Intercreditor Agreement. If the Intercreditor Agreement or
the relevant provisions thereof were avoided or held to be unenforceable for any reason, holders of the Notes would not
benefit from such first-priority treatment and be subordinated, with respect to such security interests, to senior security
interests over the same Collateral securing the Senior Secured RCF. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent has any
obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional assets that constitute the Collateral or the perfection of, or to take steps
to perfect, any security interest in the Notes against third parties.

Under Dutch law, perfection of mortgages over real estate provided by the Dutch Guarantors requires
registration in the relevant public registers. Perfection of pledges over shares in a Dutch private company with limited
liability (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) requires that the relevant company is a party to the deed
creating the pledge or that certain other requirements are satisfied. In addition, the pledges over shares must be registered
in the company's shareholders register.

**_The enforcement of the Notes Guarantees may be restricted by Spanish insolvency law._**

The Spanish Insolvency Law imposes a moratorium on the enforcement of creditors' rights in the event of
insolvency of the debtor, to the extent the collateral can be deemed by the insolvency court as an asset necessary for the
continuity of the business.

In addition, Article 583 et. seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law also provides that if a debtor notifies the court
that, being in actual or imminent insolvency, it has started negotiations with its creditors to seek support for either (i) a
collective refinancing agreement (acuerdo de refinanciación) in the terms of Article 596 et. seq. of the Spanish
Insolvency Law, (ii) an early composition agreement (convenio anticipado), or (iii) an out-of-court repayment agreement
(acuerdo extrajudicial de pagos) under Article 631 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law, it will have a three-month
additional grace period in which the obligation to file for insolvency is suspended, and one more month to file for
insolvency, provided that it files the notice before the court within two months of becoming insolvent and has not been
already declared in insolvency. From the moment this pre-insolvency notice is submitted and during the three months
pre-insolvency period, enforcement proceedings may not be initiated for the enforcement of assets necessary for the
continuation of the debtor's professional or business activity, and proceedings already initiated will be stayed, in the
event the debtor is pursuing a collective refinancing agreement, or an early composition agreement. This prohibition
extends to any debtor's asset or right in the event the debtor is pursuing an out-of-court repayment agreement. On the
contrary, enforcement of claims subject to public law are not affected by the submission of this pre-insolvency notice.

Furthermore, individual enforcements sought by holders of financial liabilities cannot be initiated (or, if they
have already been initiated, will be stayed) when it is justified that a percentage no lower than 51% of creditors
(determined by value) holding financial liabilities have supported the start of negotiations of a refinancing agreement,
undertaking not to initiate enforcements in the meantime, irrespective of whether the asset is necessary for the
continuation of the business.

Enforcements of in rem securities can be commenced after the aforementioned pre-insolvency notice is submitted,
but such enforcement becomes suspended for the time explained above as long as the collateral is an asset deemed necessary
for the continuation of the debtor's business activity. Financial collateral (garantías financieras) are not affected by the
effects of this pre-insolvency notice. The effect of the pre-insolvency notice over security interests over collateral located
outside of Spain will depend on the applicable international private law. For instance, foreclosure of security interests
located in another Member State (other than Denmark) will not be affected pursuant to the EU Recast Insolvency
Regulation.

Non-commenced or suspended enforcement actions may be commenced and restated as long as the court who
would rule on the debtor's insolvency decides the asset or right is not necessary for the continuation of the debtor's business
activity, or three months have elapsed since the pre-insolvency notice was filed.

Enforcement is also suspended in case a refinancing agreement submitted for homologation is admitted to
process by the Court, until the time the Court decides to homologate it or not.

The Spanish Insolvency Law expressly establishes that the shares or quotas of companies exclusively destined
to hold assets and the liabilities necessary for their financing will not be consider necessary for the continuation of the
debtor's business, unless the enforcement of the security over the shares or quotas constitutes a cause of termination or
modification of those contractual relationships of the company that allow the debtor to continue exploiting such assets.

Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, registered or its
equivalent in other jurisdictions and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. See "—
_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral or by_
_being second-ranking security interests". The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes from time to time may not be_
perfected, or registered or other equivalent in other jurisdictions, which may result in the loss of the priority, or a defect
in the perfection, registration or other equivalent in other jurisdictions of the security interest for the benefit of the
Trustee and holders of the Notes to which they would have been otherwise entitled. Neither the Security Agent nor the
Trustee will be obligated to create or perfect any of the security interests in the Collateral.

Holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral
securing the Notes, except through the Security Agent following the instructions of the Instructing Group. Since Spanish
law does not contemplate the concept of "security agent", there is some uncertainty as to whether a Spanish court would
recognize the authority of the Security Agent and whether this would cause delays in the enforcement and the
consequences of not being able to enforce the Notes Guarantees. Although this by itself does not prohibit appointing the
Security Agent, the absence of regulation creates uncertainty as to how a Spanish court would recognize the Security

Agent's actions in an enforcement situation. Some legal scholars argue that a security agent would only be entitled to
enforce its portion of the guaranteed obligation but not that of the other guaranteed parties. Therefore, the validity and
enforceability of guarantees or security interests granted in favor of the holders of the Notes through the Security Agent
may be subject to certain limitations. For more information, see "Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and the security interests and certain insolvency law considerations"._

**_The enforcement of the Collateral may be restricted by Polish insolvency law._**

According to Polish Insolvency Law, in the case of the declaration of the bankruptcy, the judge-commissioner
(who manages the course of the bankruptcy proceedings), at the request of the trustee, deems ineffective the burden of
the bankrupt's assets with a mortgage, lien, registered pledge or sea mortgage, if the bankrupt was not a personal debtor
of the secured creditor, and this burden was established within one year before the date of submitting the application for
announcement bankruptcy and in connection with its establishment, the bankrupt did not receive any benefits. The same
applies if an encumbrance was created in exchange for a performance incommensurately low in relation to the value of
the security given. In the event the bankrupt entity’s estate was encumbered to secure the debts of the bankrupt entity’s
relatives or associated companies, such encumbrance is legally ineffective regardless of the value of the consideration
received by the bankrupt entity, unless the other party shows that no damage has been inflicted thus on the creditors.

The Polish Insolvency Law also provides that following actions performed with respect to the bankrupt entity’s
assets are legally ineffective against the bankrupt entity: (i) acts in law whereby the bankrupt exercised control of his
assets, performed by the bankrupt within one year before the filing of the bankruptcy petition, provided that such acts
were performed gratuitously, or for a consideration but with the value of the bankrupt’s performance being drastically in
excess of that received by the bankrupt, or of that reserved for the bankrupt or for a third party; or (ii) security and the
payment of an unenforceable debt, given or made by the bankrupt within six months before the filing of the bankruptcy
petition; however, one who received the payment or the security may, by bringing an action or charge, seek the
recognition of such acts as effective if at the time when the same were performed he was unaware of the existence of
grounds for the declaration of bankruptcy.

As a result, in case where the Guarantor or the Collateral provider is deemed bankrupt, the Guarantor’s liability
under its Notes Guarantees and/or the Collateral could be eliminated upon applicable laws.

**_The enforcement of the Collateral may be restricted by Spanish law._**

Spanish insolvency law imposes a moratorium on the enforcement of secured creditors' rights (in rem security)
in the event of insolvency of the debtor, to the extent the collateral can be deemed by the Insolvency Court as an asset
necessary for the continuity of the business. The moratorium would take effect following the declaration of insolvency
until the earlier to occur of: (a) approval of a creditors' composition agreement (to the extent that it does not affect the
exercise of that right)or (b) one year has elapsed since the declaration of insolvency without liquidation proceedings
being initiated. Enforcement will be stayed even if at the time of declaration of insolvency the notices announcing the
public auction have been published. In determining which assets of the debtor are necessary for its professional or
business activities, courts have generally adopted a broad interpretation and will likely include most of the debtor's
assets. Finally, enforcement of the Collateral will be subject to the provisions of Spanish procedural law and Spanish
insolvency law, where applicable, and this may entail delays in the enforcement.

Even when the moratorium elapses, in case liquidation is declared and the creditor did not commence the
enforcement either before the insolvency declaration or after a year since the declaration of insolvency, it could lose its
right to enforce separately within the insolvency proceeding, and thus its right to control the sale of the asset by the
insolvency administrator. During the moratorium, the insolvency administrator is also entitled to repay the claim as a
claim against the insolvency estate, up to the value of the collateral as determined under the Spanish Insolvency Law
rules, as to avoid the enforcement.

In addition, there are certain rules applying to the assets securing claims in case they are sold in liquidation as
part of the debtor's business. Depending on the manner in which the asset is sold (i.e. with or without the security), such
rules could result in a sale that does not require the creditor's consent if, among others, the asset is individually sold at an
upfront price which is higher than the minimum price agreed when the security was perfected, or when the asset is sold
as part of a business unit on a going concern, and the secured creditor either lost its right to enforce separately within the
insolvency proceeding, or 75% of the special privileged creditors belonging to the same class with right to enforce
consent the asset is sold at a price implying the amount to the paid to such special privileged creditors, as determined by
the Spanish Insolvency Law, is lower than the value of the collateral.

The effects of insolvency proceedings on a creditor's in rem rights attached to property or rights –of any kind–

-----

of the debt or which, at the time of the declaration of the insolvency proceedings, are located in a state (other than a EU
Member State bound by the EU Insolvency Regulation) must be exclusively governed by the law of that state.

Moreover, the enforcement of a security interest could be delayed or even denied if the relevant court or, in the
case of a notarial enforcement, the relevant notary, deems the secured obligation contains abusive provisions.

In the case of real estate mortgages, it may be required for purposes of enforcement that at least three
installments remain unpaid or that the debtor has been in breach of its payment obligations for a period of at least three
months.

Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, registered or its
equivalent in other jurisdictions and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. See "—
_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral or by_
_being second-ranking security interests". The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes from time to time may not be_
perfected, or registered or other equivalent in other jurisdictions, which may result in the loss of the priority, or a defect
in the perfection, registration or other equivalent in other jurisdictions of the security interest for the benefit of the
Trustee and holders of the Notes to which they would have been otherwise entitled. Neither the Security Agent nor the
Trustee will be obligated to create or perfect any of the security interests in the Collateral.

Holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce the Collateral securing the Notes, except
through the Security Agent following the instructions of the Instructing Group. Since Spanish law does not contemplate
the concept of "security agent", there is some uncertainty as to whether a Spanish court would recognize the authority of
the Security Agent and whether this would cause delays in the enforcement and the consequences of not being able to
enforce the Collateral as provided in the Security Documents. Although this by itself does not prohibit appointing the
Security Agent, the absence of regulation creates uncertainty as to how a Spanish court would recognize the Security
Agent's actions in an enforcement situation. Some legal scholars argue that a security agent would only be entitled to
enforce its portion of the secured obligation but not that of the other secured parties. Therefore, the validity and
enforceability of guarantees or security interests granted in favor of the holders of the Notes through the Security Agent
may be subject to certain limitations. For more information, see "Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and the security interests and certain insolvency law considerations"._

**_The enforcement of the Collateral may be restricted by Dutch law._**

In the case of a bankruptcy (faillissement) or suspension of payments (surseance van betaling) declared in the
Netherlands in respect of a person holding title to assets that constitute Collateral, the Security Agent will be entitled to
exercise the rights afforded to a person having a Dutch law security right (being a pledge (pandrecht) or a mortgage
(hypotheek)) over those assets as if there were no bankruptcy or suspension of payment. However, such a bankruptcy or
suspension of payments would affect the position of the Security Agent as a secured party in some respects, the most
important of which are: (i) the competent court may as a general rule set a period of up to four months during which the
Security Agent may not, without the court's consent, (a) claim the asset constituting Collateral if it is under the control of
(in de macht van) the person holding title to the asset or, in the case of a bankruptcy, the trustee in bankruptcy (curator)
or (b) seek recourse against the asset, and (ii) a trustee in bankruptcy may (x) give the Security Agent a reasonable period
to exercise his rights and (y) if the Security Agent fails to sell the asset within that period, claim the asset and sell it,
without prejudice to the Security Agent's entitlement to the proceeds after deduction of a contribution to the bankruptcy
costs and taking into account the Security Agent's rank.

Enforcement of a Dutch law security right (including allocation of the proceeds) is subject to Dutch law. Under
Dutch law, in principle, a security right is enforced through a public auction of the asset subject to the security right in
accordance with Dutch law. Shares in a Dutch private company with limited liability (besloten vennootschap met
_beperkte aansprakelijkheid) may be transferred only upon enforcement in accordance with Dutch law and the articles of_
association of the company that has issued the shares, as they read at the time of enforcement.

The Security Agent or, in case the security right is a mortgage (hypotheek), the relevant security interest
provider may request the competent court to approve a private sale of the asset subject to the security right. In case of
pledged assets (but not mortgaged assets), the Security Agent and the security interest provider may agree to an
alternative method of sale of the asset once the pledge has become enforceable. The Security Agent may also request the
competent court to determine that a pledged asset shall accrue to it for a price determined by the court. For more
information, see "Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests and
_certain insolvency law considerations"._

**_The enforcement of the Collateral may be restricted by Belgian law._**

Holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce the Collateral securing the Notes, except

through the Security Agent following the instructions of the Instructing Group. The Belgian Financial Collateral Act of
December 15, 2004, expressly recognizes the validity and enforceability with respect to third parties of pledges on
financial instruments entered into by a security agent acting for one or more beneficiaries when the identity of the
beneficiaries can be ascertained in the security agreement.

The enforcement of any Collateral is subject to any limitations arising from bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation,

moratorium, reorganization and other laws of general application relating to or affecting the rights of creditors. In
particular, any provision providing for an event of default, an acceleration or an early termination of the contract by
reason of the debtor being subject to judicial reorganization proceedings is not enforceable. For more information, see
“Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests and certain insolvency law
_considerations”._

**_The enforcement of the Collateral may be restricted by Italian law._**

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity is placed under bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) or, if the

_relevant conditions are met, under extraordinary administration (amministrazione straordinaria) or under compulsory_
_administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), security interests given by it during a certain legally_
specified period (the “suspect period”) could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver /
extraordinary commissioner / judicial liquidator under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback of Royal
Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942, as reformed and currently in force (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”), and of Legislative
Decree no. 270 of July 8, 1999 (“Prodi bis Law”) and Legislative Decree no. 347 of December 23, 2003 (“Marzano
Law”). In particular, the grant of the Notes Guarantees or the Collateral to secure the Notes may be voidable by the
grantor or by a bankruptcy trustee or by the extraordinary commissioner or by the judicial liquidator or by other
creditors, or may be otherwise set aside by a court, or be unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur,
including, among others, if the grantor is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant.

If challenged successfully, the guarantee and/or security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts

received must be refunded to the receiver. To the extent that the grant of any guarantee and/or security interest is voided,
holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the guarantee and/or security interest and may not be able to recover any
amounts under the related security documents.

Clawback rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favourable to the receiver in

bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In a bankruptcy proceeding, depending on the Italian
Bankruptcy Law provides for a clawback period of up to either one year or six months in certain circumstances (please
note that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures in relation to certain transactions, the clawback period
can be extended to five and three years, respectively) and a two year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions.
The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions, which are ineffective by operation of law and
acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner by means of a
bankruptcy clawback action (azione revocatoria fallimentare). The limitation period for initiating clawback action is
three years from the declaration of bankruptcy or, if earlier, five years from the act or transaction to be clawed-back.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business (i.e. when the

entity is not placed under the insolvency procedures mentioned above), an action can be brought by any creditor of a
given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a security, agreement and any other act by
which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to revoke and declare ineffective pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian
Civil Code (azione revocatoria ordinaria) the said security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to
the acting creditor’s right of credit.

An Italian court could revoke the said security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the

ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings:

    - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor,
or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently
designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and

    - that, in the case of non-gratuitous act, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the
act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the
fraudulent design.

-----

If a court decided that a security interest was unenforceable, the beneficiary of the security interest may cease to
have any claim with respect to the relevant grantor of security.

**_The Notes Guarantees and security interests in the Collateral are significantly limited by applicable laws and are_**
**_subject to certain limitations on enforcement or defenses._**

The Guarantors will guarantee the payment of the Notes as described in "Description of the Notes—The Notes
_Guarantees" and the Collateral will secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees as described in "Description of the_
_Notes—Security". The Notes Guarantees provide the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant_
Guarantor. However, the obligations of each Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee and the amount secured by, or
enforcement of, the Collateral will be limited under the Indenture to an amount that has been determined so as to ensure
that amounts payable will not result in violations of laws relating to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
voidable preference, capitalization, capital preservation (under which, among other requirements, the risks associated
with a guarantee or grant of security on account of a parent company's or an affiliate company's debt must be reasonable
and economically and operationally justified from the Guarantor's or grantor's perspective or must be covered by its
available net assets on the balance sheet), thin capitalization, corporate purpose, financial assistance or transactions under
value, or otherwise cause the Guarantor or grantor of Collateral to be deemed insolvent under applicable law or such
Notes Guarantee or Collateral to be deemed void, unenforceable or ultra vires, or cause the directors of such Guarantor to
be held in breach of applicable corporate or commercial law for providing such Notes Guarantee or Collateral. If these
limitations are not observed, the Notes Guarantees and the grant of security interests by the Guarantors could be subject
to legal challenge. The Indenture and the security agreements may include language limiting the amount or the
enforcement of the Note Guarantee and the Collateral to account for such legal constraints.

Enforcement of any of the Notes Guarantees and Collateral against any Guarantor will be subject to certain
defenses available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among jurisdictions, in general, under
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and other laws, a court could subordinate, void or invalidate all or a
portion of a Guarantor's obligation under the Notes Guarantees or the security interest granted under the Security
Documents and, if payment had already been made under a Notes Guarantee or enforcement proceeds applied under a
Security Document, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or take
other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found, inter alia, that:

    - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the
relevant Security Document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law;

    - the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document was incurred with actual
intent to give preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders
of the Guarantor or security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply
aware that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant Notes
Guarantee or security interest;

    - the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or
corporate benefit for the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest and the Guarantor or security
provider was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Notes Guarantee or security
interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Notes Guarantee or
Security Document; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its
ability to pay at maturity; or

    - the relevant Notes Guarantees or Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objects or
corporate purposes of the Guarantor or security provider or not to be in the best interests or for the
corporate benefit of or to promote the success of the Guarantor or security provider.

Furthermore, the enforcement of any claims arising under the Notes Guarantees and/or the Security Documents
may become barred under the provisions of law applicable in the relevant jurisdiction concerning prescriptions and
limitations by the lapse of time or may be or become subject to a defense of set-off or counterclaim, fraud or negligence.
In addition, the enforcement of legal obligations may be prevented or invalidated in the case of fraudulent enforcement.

As a result, a Guarantor's liability under its Notes Guarantees could be materially reduced or eliminated
depending upon the amounts of its other obligations and upon applicable laws. In particular, in certain jurisdictions, a
guarantee issued by a company that is not in that company's corporate interests or the burden of which exceeds the
benefit to the company may not be valid and enforceable. It is possible that a Guarantor, a creditor of a Guarantor or the
insolvency administrator, in the case of an insolvency of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the
respective Notes Guarantee and that the applicable court may determine that the Notes Guarantee should be limited or

75


-----

voided. In the event that any Notes Guarantee is deemed invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent
that agreed limitations on the Notes Guarantee apply, the Notes would not be guaranteed by such Notes Guarantee. For
more information on the specific limitations under applicable law of the respective jurisdictions of incorporation of the
Guarantors and certain contractual limitations to be confirmed in the Indenture, see "Limitations on validity and
_enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests and certain insolvency law considerations"._

_Spanish law_

The laws of Spain may limit the ability of the Guarantors to guarantee the Notes or grant security on the
Collateral. Any guarantee, pledge or mortgage generally must guarantee or secure a primary obligation to which it is
ancillary. This implies that the primary obligation must be clearly identified in the guarantee or security agreement and
the nullity or termination of the primary obligation entails the nullity or termination of the ancillary guarantee or security.
Consequently, if the primary obligation is deemed null and void, the ancillary guarantee or security interest will also be
deemed null and void, and may be also affected by any amendment, supplement, waiver, repayment, novation or
extinction of the Issuer's obligations under the Notes.

The interpretations of the laws of Spain by the courts may limit the ability of Spanish Guarantors to guarantee
the Notes. Although the law does not establish any limit, certain judgments indicate (and certain scholars understand) that
risks associated with a guarantee or a security interest provided by a company to secure the indebtedness held by other
companies within its corporate group shall be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the
guarantor's own perspective and justified under the corporate interest of such guarantor and all this must be evidenced to
the judge.

In addition, the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor entity granting a security interest in favor of the
holders of the Notes cannot extend to any obligation which, if incurred, would constitute a breach of Spanish financial
assistance rules. Pursuant to these rules, a Spanish company may not generally advance funds, grant loans, guarantees or
security interests or provide any other type of financial assistance in connection with the acquisition of its own shares or
those of its parent company, in the case of public limited liability companies, or other companies within the same group,
in the case of private limited liability companies. Any guarantee or security granted in breach of these provisions may be
deemed null and void. There are no whitewash procedures available in Spain.

Under Spanish law, claims may become time-barred (a general term of five years is set forth in the Spanish
Civil Code for personal obligations) or may be or become subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim. In addition,
an extension of maturity granted to a debtor by a creditor without the consent of the guarantor extinguishes the guarantee.

A Spanish court may not accept acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if the default were of
minimal importance. To be recognized by the Spanish courts as giving rise to the remedy of acceleration, a default must
be material. The decision to accelerate an agreement must be based on objective facts and cannot be left to the sole
discretion of one party as this would not be permitted by Article 1,256 of the Spanish Civil Code.

The terms "enforceable", "enforceability", "valid", "legal", "binding" and "effective" or any combination thereof
mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type enforced by
Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in
accordance with their terms. Enforcement before courts will in any event be subject to:

    - the nature of the remedies available in the courts;

    - Spanish public policy; and

    - the availability of defenses such as, without limitation, set-off (unless validly waived), circumvention
of law (fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force
majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, abatement and counterclaim.

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees is also subject to the laws regulating insolvency or
liquidation proceedings and to other laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors
rights and remedies.

In addition, there are certain Guarantors which are assignees of an administrative concession. The enforcement
of such administrative concessions as a result of the enforcement of any of the Notes Guarantees against any of the
referred Guarantors shall require the prior consent of the relevant authorities. If such consent is not obtained, the creditor
will not be able to enforce its credit against such administrative concession and the Guarantor will continue being the

76


-----

owner of the administrative concession and having to comply with the obligations arising from such administrative
concession.

Lastly, under Spanish law, the valid creation of an in rem right of security requires at least the formalization of
the relevant security document as a public deed (escritura o póliza), without prejudice to any additional formalities or
perfection requirements that may be required depending on the type of secured asset. Without notarization of the security
documents, the secured parties (i) will not have access to the executive summary proceedings (juicio ejecutivo) in case of
judicial enforcement of the security documents in Spain, having the secured parties to follow necessarily the ordinary
judicial proceedings (juicio ordinario) and (ii) will not be considered as secured creditors having a special privilege over
the assets part of the security package in case of insolvency of the relevant Spanish security provider.

_Dutch law_

Dutch law may limit the ability of a Dutch Guarantor to guarantee the Notes or grant security on the Collateral.
The validity and enforceability of a Notes Guarantee of, or a security interest granted by or in, the Dutch Guarantors may
be successfully contested by the relevant Dutch Guarantor, or its trustee in bankruptcy if it is subject to bankruptcy
proceedings, on the basis of an ultra vires claim, which will be successful if both (i) the granting of the security right or
guarantee does not fall within the scope of the objects of the company (doeloverschrijding) and (ii) the company's
counterparty under the relevant security right or guarantee knew or ought to have known, without inquiry, of this fact. In
determining whether the granting of a security right or guarantee falls within the scope of the objects and purposes of a
Dutch company, a court will consider all relevant circumstances, in particular (i) the text of the objects clause in the
company's articles of association, (ii) whether the granting of such security right or guarantee is in the company's
corporate interests (vennootschappelijk belang) and to its benefit and (iii) whether the company's subsistence is
jeopardized by the granting of such security right or guarantee. The mere fact that a certain legal act (rechtshandeling) is
explicitly reflected in a Dutch company's objects clause may not be sufficient to conclude that such legal act is not ultra
vires.

The validity and enforceability of such a Notes Guarantee or security interest may also be successfully contested
by any creditor of the relevant Dutch Guarantor, or by trustee in bankruptcy if it is subject to bankruptcy proceedings, if
the Notes Guarantee or security interest is prejudicial to the interests of that creditor or, in the case of bankruptcy
proceedings, any other creditor and the other requirements for fraudulent transfers under the Dutch Civil Code and Dutch
Bankruptcy Act are satisfied.

Under Dutch law, it is uncertain whether a Dutch law security interest (in the form of a pledge (pandrecht) or a
mortgage (hypotheek)) can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the claim to be secured by the security interest.
For that reason, the security documents pursuant to which Dutch law security interests will be granted over the assets of
the Dutch Guarantors use a parallel debt structure. However, such a parallel debt structure has never been tested before a
Dutch court, and it may not mitigate or eliminate the risk of unenforceability posed by Dutch law.

Under Dutch law, receipt of any payment made by any Dutch Guarantor under a Notes Guarantee or security
interest may be adversely affected by specific or general defenses available to debtors under Dutch law in respect of the
validity, binding effect and enforceability of such Notes Guarantee or security interest.

_Belgian law_

The laws of Belgium may limit the ability of a Belgian company (i.e. a Belgian Guarantor or a Belgian collateral
provider) to guarantee the Notes or grant security on the Collateral. These limitations arise from the interpretation of
various provisions and from certain general principles of corporate law which include rules governing corporate interest
(intérêt social/vennootschapsbelang) under which, among others, the risk associated with a guarantee or grant of security
on account of a parent or sister company's debt must be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the
guarantor's or grantor's perspective. In addition, the granting of a guarantee or collateral by a Belgian company must be
within grantor's corporate purpose. If the granting of a guarantee or the creation of a security interest does not fall within
the grantor's corporate purpose, it could, upon certain conditions, be held null and void. Under Belgian law, any
guarantee, pledge or mortgage generally must guarantee or secure a primary obligation to which it is ancillary. The
primary obligation must be clearly identified in the guarantee or security agreement, and the nullification or termination
of the primary obligation entails the nullification or termination of the ancillary guarantee or security. Consequently, if
the primary obligation is deemed null and void, the ancillary guarantee or security interest will also be deemed null and
void. In the case of a share pledge, the ranking of a given pledge will depend on the date of registration of such pledge in
the shareholders' register.

77


-----

Under Belgian law, claims may become time-barred (a general term of 10 years is set forth in the Belgian Civil
Code for personal obligations) or may be or become subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim.

The terms "enforceable", "enforceability", "valid", "legal", "binding" and "effective" or any combination thereof
mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type enforced by
Belgian courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in
accordance with their terms. Enforcement before courts will in any event be subject to:

    - the nature of the remedies available in the courts; and

    - the availability of defenses such as, without limitation, set-off (unless validly waived), circumvention
of law (fraude à la loi/wetsontduiking), abuse in the exercise of rights (abus de droit/rechtsmisbruik),
force majeure, error (erreur/dwaling), misrepresentation (dol/bedrog), duress (violence/geweld) and
counterclaim.

The Issuer reorganized the business of Jolly Hotels Belgium, S.A. to avoid future losses and the gains derived
from the reorganization restored the company's balance sheet above €2.5 million, the minimum threshold set forth by
Belgian law (i.e. €61,500), so nobody may demand that the court orders the dissolution of Jolly Hotel Belgio, SA.

_Italian law_

Under Italian Law the guarantee obligations under the Indenture of an Italian Guarantor are subject to
compliance with, inter alia, the rules on corporate benefit, corporate authorization and certain other Italian mandatory
provisions. If a guarantee or a security interest is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization or
restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered.

An Italian company granting a guarantee must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee.
Such principle on corporate benefit applies equally to down-stream, cross-stream and up-stream guarantees issued by
Italian companies. While the existence of a corporate benefit in relation to a downstream guarantee is usually self-evident
(i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant guarantor), the
existence of a corporate benefit in relation to a cross-stream or an up-stream guarantee (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing
financial obligations of direct or indirect parent companies or sister companies of the relevant guarantor) may be
challenged unless it can be proved that the guarantor may derive some benefits or advantages from the granting of the
guarantee, therefore it should be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis (such as in the case of subsidiary guarantors
which are providing the Guarantees in connection with the Notes offered hereby). The concept of real and adequate
corporate benefit is not expressly defined in under Italian law and is assessed by and determined on a case- by-case basis,
further its existence is purely a business decision of the directors and the statutory auditors. As a general rule, corporate
benefit is assessed at the level of the relevant company on a standalone basis, although in certain circumstances, and
subject to specific rules, the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration.
In particular, in case of upstream and cross-stream guarantees for the financial obligations of group companies, examples
may include financial consideration in the form of a guarantee fee or access to cash flows in the form of intercompany
loans from other members of the Group, while transactions featuring debt financing of distributions to shareholders are
largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such
transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest.

The general rule is that the risk assumed by the Italian Guarantor must not be disproportionate to the direct or
indirect economic benefit to the guarantor. To this extent, customary “limitation language” is usually inserted in
indentures, credit agreements and guarantees for the purpose of limiting the amount guaranteed by the guarantor to an
amount that is proportionate for the direct or indirect economic benefit to the guarantor derived from the transaction.

In principle, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the guarantee or the collateral ultra vires and
potentially affected by conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors
may be subject matter of challenges and annulment.

Thus, civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of the guarantor if it is assessed that they did not act in the
best interest of the guarantor and that the acts they carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the guarantor or
were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil
liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over the guarantor or having knowingly received
an advantage or profit from such improper control. However, no liability can be attributed where no prejudice or actual
damage is suffered by the Italian Guarantor because of the determination of the controlling shareholder as provided under
Article 2497 of the Italian Civil Code having regard to the overall result of the controlling activity. Moreover, the

78


-----

guarantee could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the
third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interests of the guarantor.

The rules on corporate benefit apply equally to security provided by subsidiaries in relation to the financial
obligations of their parent or sister companies.

As to corporate authorizations and financial assistance, the granting of a guarantee or security by an Italian
company must be permitted by the articles of association (statuto) of the Italian company providing such guarantee. In
addition, the granting of a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability that would result in unlawful
financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code pursuant to
which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give financial assistance (whether by means of
loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) for the acquisition or subscription of its own shares or quotas by a third party or
those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company. Financial assistance for refinancing
indebtedness in originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or
indirect parent company would also be a violation. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these
provisions is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interest of the
company.

In the light of the above, in no event shall the obligations and liabilities of the Italian Guarantor under a
guarantee include the obligation to guarantee financial indebtedness which was incurred, in full or in part, to purchase the
shares of such Italian Guarantor (or of any of its direct or indirect holding company) and which would therefore
constitute the provision of financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 and/or 2474, as the case may be, of the
Italian Civil Code whereas, in the latter case, an authorization proceeding in the shareholders’ meeting is not
implemented. To this extent, the total value of the guarantee cannot exceed the profits and the distributable reserves as
resulting from the approved financial statements.

Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within
the meaning of Article 106 of the Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993 (the “Italian Banking Act”), whose
exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorised financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions
of the Italian Banking Act may, inter alia, cause the Guarantees to be considered null and void. In this respect, the
Ministerial Decree No. 53 of 2 April 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that
the issuance of guarantees or security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same
group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies
within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies, which are under the control of the
same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the Italian Guarantor and the guaranteed entity being part
of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity.

In addition, under Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a personal guarantee is issued to guarantee
conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be
expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate
document, such as the Indenture). It has been held, that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant
guarantor’s assets. It is uncertain, however, whether courts are entitled to debate and to rule over such determination.

Italian Law No. 108 of 7 March 1996, as amended, implemented or supplemented from time to time (the “Italian
_Usury Law”), prevents lenders from applying interests higher than certain rates, as set forth in accordance with the Italian_
Usury Law (the “Usury Rates”). In addition, even where the Usury Rates are not exceeded, the interest rate applicable
may be held usurious if: (i) it is considered to be disproportionate to the amount lent (taking into account the specific
circumstances of the transaction and the average rate applicable to similar transactions in the market) and (ii) the debtor
is deemed to have been in financial and economic difficulties at the time the indebtedness was incurred. In order to
comply with (i) the Italian Usury Law and Article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) the mandatory provisions of
Italian law in relation to capitalization of interests (including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code), the obligations of
any Italian Guarantor under a guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (x) Usury Rates and (y) any interest on
overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code,
respectively.

In any event, pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, a guarantee granted by an Italian Guarantor
must be capped at a maximum guaranteed amount.

The guarantees created through pledges on unlisted securities cannot be immediately liquidated.

79


-----

Under Article 2352 of the Italian Civil Code, in the case of a pledge on shares, the voting rights, unless agreed
otherwise, belong the holder of the pledge and in the case of capital increase pursuant to Article 2442 of the Italian Civil
Code, the pledge is extended to the newly issued shares.

_German law_

German law may limit the ability of a German Guarantor to guarantee the Notes. The granting of guarantees by
a German limited liability company (GmbH) or a partnership with a limited liability company as liable partner
(e.g. a GmbH & Co. KG) is subject to certain capital maintenance rules under German law. Payment under guarantees
may be regarded as disbursements to a parent company if guaranteeing or securing debt of a parent company or an
affiliate of the parent company. Such disbursements are only allowed as long as the stated share capital of the guarantor
is not affected, i.e. may only be made out of the freely available net assets on the balance sheet. The Indenture will
contain language limiting the Note Guarantee accordingly. Furthermore, the German Limited Liability Companies Act
restricts payments if and to the extent such payments under any Note Guarantee would deprive the German Guarantor of
the liquidity necessary to fulfill its financial liabilities to its creditors. This limitation could, to the extent applicable,
restrict the enforcement of the relevant Note Guarantee.

German insolvency proceedings may limit the enforcement of guarantees. The insolvency court may prohibit or
suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against an insolvent company's assets during preliminary
proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue
their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with
the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code. Any judicial enforcement action brought against the insolvent company
by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered
by a court, with respect to assets other than real estate also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the
time when insolvency proceedings commence).

Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof)
regarding so called destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives
a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied
by courts with respect to the enforcement of the Notes Guarantees. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized
may be reduced, even to zero.

In addition, under German law, a creditor who is the beneficiary of a transaction effecting the repayment of the
stated share capital of a debtor in the form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG or obtained security from a debtor may be
liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor's impending insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor's
impending insolvency at the time such funding was provided or extended and/or such security was granted. The German
Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that such liability may arise if, for example, the creditor acted with the
intent to detrimentally influence the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of
bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be presumed if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any
circumstances indicating that the debtor was close to insolvency (Zusammenbruch) or had reason to enquire further with
respect thereto.

Under German law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees given by it
during a certain legally specified period (the "hardening period") could be subject to potential challenges by an appointed
insolvency administrator, preliminary insolvency administrator or, in certain cases, other creditors under the German
Insolvency Act. In the absence of insolvency proceedings, creditors may challenge guarantees under the Act of
Avoidance. If challenged successfully, the guarantee may become unenforceable. To the extent that the grant of any Note
Guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the Note Guarantee and may not be able to recover
any amounts under the related Note Guarantee. The holders of the Notes may also be required to repay any amounts
received with respect to such Note Guarantee.

Under German law, claims may become time barred (a general term of three years is set forth in the German
Civil Code which may be altered by special provisions) or may be or become subject to the defense of set off or
counterclaim.

The terms "enforceable", "enforceability", "valid", "legal", "binding" and "effective" or any combination thereof
mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type which can be
enforced in accordance with the rules of civil procedure as applied by German courts; the terms do not mean that these

80


-----

obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. Enforcement will in any
event be subject to:

    - the obligations being of a type and kind for which an enforcement procedure does exist under German
law; and

    - the availability of defenses such as, without limitation, set off (unless validly waived), violation of the
principle of loyalty and good faith (Treu und Glauben), violation of the principle of bonos mores
(Verstoß gegen die guten Sitten), circumvention of law, violation of a legal prohibition (Verstoß gegen
_ein gesetzliches Verbot), abuse in the exercise of rights (Rechtsmissbrauch/Schikaneverbot), force_
majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, and duress.

_Luxembourg laws_

Under Luxembourg law, guarantees granted by Luxembourg companies are subject to certain limitations. The
conditions to be satisfied by the granting of guarantees relate to (i) corporate power, (ii) corporate authority, and (iii)
corporate benefit. These rules are derived from general principles and must be applied to specific circumstances, which
have to be analyzed on a case by case basis. See “Limitations on validity and enforceability of Notes Guarantees granted
by any Luxembourg subsidiaries”.

**_Fraudulent conveyance laws may limit your rights as a holder of Notes._**

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance laws, a court could
subordinate or void a Notes Guarantee if it found that:

    - the Notes Guarantee was incurred with an actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or
shareholders of the Guarantor;

    - the Notes Guarantee was granted within a specified timeframe prior to the insolvency declaration of the
Guarantor and it is detrimental for the Guarantor's state;

    - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the Notes Guarantee
and the Guarantor (1) was insolvent, became insolvent within a specified timeframe or was rendered
insolvent because of the Notes Guarantee; (2) was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized
because of the Notes Guarantee; or (3) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond
its ability to pay at maturity.

The measure of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance laws varies depending upon the law applied.
Generally, however, a Guarantor would be considered insolvent if it could not pay its debts as they become due. If a
court decided that any Notes Guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voided the Notes Guarantee, or held it
unenforceable for any other reason, you would cease to have any claim in respect of the Guarantor of the Notes
Guarantee and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and the remaining Guarantors. See "Limitations on validity and
_enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests and certain insolvency law considerations"._

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency
administrator may challenge the Notes Guarantees, and intercompany obligations generally, as fraudulent transfers or
conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, (i) to avoid or
invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor's obligations under its Notes Guarantee; (ii) to direct that holders of the Notes
return any amounts paid under a Notes Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor's
creditors; and (iii) to take other action that is detrimental to you.

_Spanish law_

In accordance with Spanish Insolvency Law, any action carried out or agreement entered into by the debtor in
the two years preceding its declaration of insolvency can be clawed back (rescinded) by the court if the action or
agreement is considered detrimental to the insolvency estate. This may arise even in the absence of fraudulent intent or
link to the insolvency. As a general rule, the insolvency administrator or the creditors who exercise the claw back action
have to prove that the act was detrimental. This notwithstanding, the following acts are presumed detrimental without
there being any possibility to provide evidence to the contrary: (a) acts where no consideration is received for a disposed
asset and (b) acts that result in the early repayment or settlement of obligations which would have become due after the

81


-----

declaration of insolvency (unless such obligations were secured by means of an in rem security). In the following cases,
the presumption is rebuttable: (a) disposals made in favor of "specially related parties" to the debtor (including, inter alia,
shareholders that meet certain requirements, group companies and legal or de facto directors), (b) the creation of a
security interest securing a pre-existing obligation or a new obligation that replaces an existing one and (c) those
payments or other acts extinguishing obligations that would have become due after the declaration of insolvency and
which are secured by means of an in rem security. Claims arising in favor of a creditor as a result of a claw back action
will be subordinated (i.e., paid last) if the court has determined that the creditor acted in bad faith.

In respect to such claw back claims, recent Spanish case law indicates, and certain scholars understand that,
intragroup guarantees and security are deemed such as a transaction entered into in favor to parties that have a special
relationship with the debtor (although the creditor is not a related party), so that the abovementioned rebuttable
presumption of detriment applies. In such a case, Spanish case law considers that such presumption may be rebutted
when the group company providing the intragroup guarantee or security has received an equivalent compensation in
exchange.

Other claims may also be subordinated including, inter alia, (a) claims by legal or natural persons who are
"specially related parties" to the debtor (including, de facto directors) and (b) claims arising from reciprocal obligations if
the court rules, based on the insolvency administrator's report, that the creditor repeatedly obstructed compliance with the
agreement against the interest of the insolvency estate. Security interests granted by the debtor to secure subordinated
claims will be cancelled by the court.

Furthermore, under Spanish law, any creditor (as well as the insolvency administrator (administrador concursal)
may bring an action to rescind a contract or agreement (acción pauliana) against its debtor and the third party which is a
party to such contract or agreement, provided they were performed or entered into fraudulently and the creditor cannot
obtain payment of the amounts owed in any other way. Although case law is not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted
that the following requirements must be met in order for a creditor to bring such action:

    - the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took place after
such debt was created;

    - the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third party;

    - that such act was fraudulent;

    - there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages
suffered; and

    - debtor's insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the debtor's
estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim.

The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements under
Spanish law for the action to rescind to succeed. Pursuant to Article 1,297 of the Spanish Civil Code: (i) agreements by
virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration, and (ii) transfers for consideration carried out by parties
who have been held liable by a court (sentencia condenatoria) or whose assets have been subject to a writ of attachment
(mandamiento de embargo) will be considered fraudulent. The presumption referred to in (i) above is a iuris et de iure
presumption (cannot be rebutted by evidence), unlike the presumption indicated in (ii) above, which is a iuris tantum
presumption (a rebuttable presumption). Pursuant to Article 1,292 of the Spanish Civil Code, payments of non-due debts
made in insolvency may also be rescinded.

According to scholars, if the rescission action were to be upheld the third party would be liable to return the
consideration received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor. Following that, the creditor
would need to carry out the actions necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor. If the consideration received by
the third party under the contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the third party must indemnify the creditor for such
damages.

The legal term to bring a civil rescission claim is four years.

_Dutch law_

Dutch law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent transfer both in and outside of bankruptcy. Under
these provisions, a legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it

82


-----

guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a
third party's obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act
having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person and may be nullified by the
trustee in bankruptcy (curator) in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person
outside bankruptcy, if (i) the person performed such acts without an obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor
concerned or, in the case of the person's bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced as a consequence of the act, and (iii) at
the time the act was or the acts were performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should
have known that its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced. In addition, in the case of a bankruptcy, the trustee
in bankruptcy may nullify the debtor's performance of any due and payable obligation (including (without limitation) an
obligation to provide security for any of its or a third party's obligations) if (i) the payee knew that a request for
bankruptcy had been filed at the moment of payment, or (ii) the performance of the obligation was the result of a
consultation between the debtor and the payee with a view to give preference to the latter over the debtor's other
creditors.

If a Dutch court found that the granting of the Notes Guarantees or the Collateral or any other transaction
entered into by the Dutch Guarantors at any time in connection with the Notes, including the transactions contemplated
by the Intercreditor Agreement, involved a fraudulent transfer as set out above, then the granting of the Notes Guarantees
or the Collateral or any other transaction entered into by the Dutch Guarantors in connection with the Notes could be
nullified. In the case of a successful challenge, holders of the Notes would not enjoy the benefit of the Notes Guarantees,
the Collateral or other transactions. The value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the
Notes whether upon enforcement of the Collateral or otherwise, could also be subject to recovery from such holders of
the Notes, and possibly from subsequent transferees, by prejudiced creditors of the Dutch Guarantors as a result of any
fraudulent transfer. In addition, holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by such prejudiced
creditors.

_Belgian law_

Regardless of any declaration by the commercial court of a suspect period (see further under "Limitations on
_validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests and certain insolvency law_
_considerations—Applicable Insolvency Laws—Belgian Insolvency Law"), transactions of which it can be demonstrated_
that they have been entered into with the fraudulent intention to cause a prejudice to a third creditor, meaning that the
parties knew or should have known that this would aggrieve the interests of the third party creditor, may be declared
ineffective against third parties and the receiver will be authorized to disregard the transaction.

_Italian law_

Under fraudulent conveyance and other provisions of Italian law, a court could void or invalidate all or a portion
of a guarantee or of a security interest under the relevant deed of guarantee or security agreement and, if enforcement and
sale of the Collateral had already been completed, require the recipients of that sale to return the proceeds to the relevant
grantor, if the court found that, inter alia:

(i) the relevant grantor gave such security interest/guarantee with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud
its current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or when the
beneficiary of the security interest/guarantee was aware that the relevant grantor was insolvent when it
gave the relevant security interest/guarantee;

(ii) the relevant grantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for its security
interest/guarantee or the relevant grantor was insolvent at the time the security interest/guarantee was
given;

(iii) the relevant grantor was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant grantor or not to be in the
best interest or for the corporate benefit of the relevant grantor; or

(iv) the grantor giving such security interest/guarantee was aware, or should have been aware, that the
transaction was to the detriment of the creditors.

If a court decided that a security interest or a guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such security
interest or guarantee, the beneficiary of the security interest or of the guarantee may cease to have any claim with respect
to the relevant grantor of a security interest/guarantee.

In any case, it should be noted that: (i) under article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, all transactions for no
consideration, depending on certain circumstances, are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity

83


-----

in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration; and (ii) under article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law,
payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-à-vis
creditors (and could therefore be clawed back), if performed by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the
declaration of insolvency.

Payments or grants of securities and/or other transactions are exempted from claw back or avoidance provisions
in the event of subsequent bankruptcy (or amministrazione straordinaria or liquidazione coatta amministrativa) inter
_alia when executed and/or performed in accordance with (a) out-of-court debt restructuring plans pursuant to Article 67,_
Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, (b) validated debt restructuring agreements with creditors (“accordi di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti”) under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or (c) composition with creditors under_
Articles 160 et seq. of Italian Bankruptcy Law (“concordato preventivo”), including composition with creditors with
continuity of the going-concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) and composition with creditors preceded by the
filing of a preliminary and simplified petition (concordato con riserva under Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law).

In addition, it should be noted that the EU Regulation no. 848/2015 of European Parliament and Council, of
May 20, 2015, contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in
relation to insolvency proceedings within the EU.

_German law_

Under German law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees given by it
during a certain legally specified period (the "hardening period") could be subject to potential challenges by an appointed
insolvency administrator, preliminary insolvency administrator or, in certain cases, other creditors under the German
Insolvency Act. In the absence of insolvency proceedings, creditors may challenge guarantees under the Act of
Avoidance. See "Limitations on validity and enforceability of Notes Guarantees granted by any German subsidiaries—
_Hardening periods and fraudulent transfer"._

If challenged successfully, the guarantee may become unenforceable. To the extent that the grant of any Note
Guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the Note Guarantee and may not be able to recover
any amounts under the related Note Guarantee. The holders of the Notes may also be required to repay any amounts
received with respect to such Note Guarantee.

_Luxembourg law_

Under Luxembourg law, for transactions entered into or payments made by a Luxembourg company during the
period before the opening of the insolvency proceedings, if the liquidator or administrator (including, without limitation,
in relation to a Luxembourg company, any commissaire, juge-commissaire, liquidateur or curateur or similar official) can
show that the Luxembourg company has given “preference” to any person by defrauding the rights of creditors generally,
regardless of when this fraud occurred, a Luxembourg court has the power to void the “abnormal” transaction. See
“Limitations on validity and enforceability of Notes Guarantees granted by any Luxembourg subsidiaries”.

**_Local insolvency laws may not be as favorable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and insolvency laws of another_**
**_jurisdiction with which you may be more familiar._**

The Issuer is incorporated in Spain and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of multiple jurisdictions,
including Belgium, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, the Czech Republic, Poland, Mexico, France,
Argentina, the United States, Chile, Uruguay, Austria, Luxembourg, Germany and Switzerland. See "Summary—The
_Offering—Notes Guarantees". The insolvency laws of these jurisdictions may not be as favorable to holders of the Notes_
as the laws of some other jurisdictions with which you may be more familiar. Certain provisions of the insolvency laws
in these jurisdictions could affect, inter alia, the ranking of the Notes and the Notes Guarantees or claims relating to the
Notes and the Notes Guarantees on an insolvency of the Issuer or the Guarantors, as the case may be. In particular, the
insolvency law of such jurisdictions may be less favorable in terms of, inter alia, priority of creditors, the ability to obtain
post-petition interest and the ability to influence proceedings and the duration thereof, and this may limit ability of the
holders of the Notes to receive payments due on the Notes. See "Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and the security interests and certain insolvency law considerations"._

_Spanish law_

Under Spanish Insolvency Law, the enforcement of in rem security interests could be restricted upon the filing
by the debtor of a pre-insolvency notice in accordance with Article 588 et. seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law.
Moreover, once a debtor is declared insolvent, the enforcement of in rem security interests over assets owned by the

84


-----

debtor will be stayed until the first of the following circumstances occur: (a) approval of a creditors' composition
agreement, unless the composition agreement does not affect such right, (b) one year has elapsed since the declaration of
insolvency without liquidation proceedings being initiated. The stay may be lifted if the insolvency court considers that
the relevant asset is not necessary for the continuation of the debtor's professional or business activities. The secured
creditor could also lose its right to enforce separately within the insolvency proceedings if liquidation is declared and the
creditor did not commence the enforcement prior to either the insolvency declaration or after one year since the
declaration of insolvency. See "The enforcement of the Collateral may be restricted by Spanish law".

Furthermore, in accordance with Spanish Insolvency Law, any action carried out or agreement entered into by
the debtor in the two years preceding its declaration of insolvency can be clawed back (rescinded) by the court if the
action or agreement is considered detrimental to the insolvency estate. This may arise even in the absence of fraudulent
intent or link to the insolvency. As a general rule, the insolvency administrator or the creditors who exercise the claw
back action have to prove that the act was detrimental. This notwithstanding, the following acts are presumed detrimental
without there being any possibility to provide evidence to the contrary: (a) acts where no consideration is received for a
disposed asset and (b) acts that result in the early repayment or settlement of obligations which would have become due
after the declaration of insolvency (unless such obligations were secured by means of an in rem security). In the
following cases, the presumption is rebuttable: (a) disposals made in favor of "specially related parties" to the debtor
(including, inter alia, shareholders that meet certain requirements, group companies and legal or de facto directors),
(b) the creation of a security interest securing a pre-existing obligation or a new obligation that replaces an existing one
and (c) those payments or other acts extinguishing obligations that would have become due after the declaration of
insolvency and which are secured by means of an in rem security. Claims arising in favor of a creditor as a result of a
claw back action will be subordinated (i.e., paid last) if the court has determined that the creditor acted in bad faith. Other
claims may also be subordinated including, inter alia, (a) claims by legal or natural persons who are "specially related
parties" to the debtor (including, de facto directors) and (b) claims arising from reciprocal obligations if the court rules,
based on the insolvency administrator's report, that the creditor repeatedly obstructed compliance with the agreement
against the interest of the insolvency estate. Security interests granted by the debtor to secure subordinated claims will be
cancelled by the court. See "Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests
_and certain insolvency law considerations—Spanish insolvency law"._

_Dutch law_

To the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a person, can be challenged in or outside
bankruptcy of the relevant person and may be nullified by the trustee in bankruptcy (curator) in a bankruptcy of the
relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, if (i) the person performed such acts
without an obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person's bankruptcy, any
creditor, was prejudiced as a consequence of the act, and (iii) at the time the act was or the acts were performed both the
person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that its creditors (existing or future) would be
prejudiced. In addition, in the case of a bankruptcy, the trustee in bankruptcy may nullify the debtor's performance of any
due and payable obligation (including (without limitation) an obligation to provide security for any of its or a third party's
obligations) if (i) the payee knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed at the moment of payment, or (ii) the
performance of the obligation was the result of a consultation between the debtor and the payee with a view to give
preference to the latter over the debtor's other creditors.

In the case of a bankruptcy (faillissement) or suspension of payments (surseance van betaling) declared in the
Netherlands in respect of a person holding title to assets that constitute Collateral, the Security Agent will be entitled to
exercise the rights afforded to a person having a Dutch law security right (being a pledge (pandrecht) or a mortgage
(hypotheek)) over those assets as if there were no bankruptcy or suspension of payment. However, such a bankruptcy or
suspension of payments would affect the position of the Security Agent as a secured party in some respects, the most
important of which are: (i) the competent court may as a general rule set a period of up to four months during which the
Security Agent may not, without the court's consent, (a) claim the asset constituting Collateral if it is under the control of
(in de macht van) the person holding title to the asset or, in the case of a bankruptcy, the trustee in bankruptcy (curator)
or (b) seek recourse against the asset, and (ii) a trustee in bankruptcy may (x) give the Security Agent a reasonable period
to exercise his rights and (y) if the Security Agent fails to sell the asset within that period, claim the asset and sell it,
without prejudice to the Security Agent's entitlement to the proceeds after deduction of a contribution to the bankruptcy
costs and taking into account the Security Agent's rank.

See "—The enforcement of the Collateral may be restricted by Dutch law" and "Limitations on validity and
_enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests and certain insolvency law considerations—Dutch_
_insolvency law"._

_Belgian law_

In the case of a judicial reorganization of a Belgian collateral provider, the Security Agent will, with a few
exceptions, not be entitled, during the suspension period, to enforce its rights as a secured party. The judicial
reorganization by way of transfer under court supervision could also be detrimental to the Security Agent because the
court can approve; provided the price offered is reasonable, a sale of the Belgian collateral provider's activities, including
the pledged assets, without the Security Agent's authorization.

In the case of a bankruptcy of a Belgian collateral provider, the Security Agent may not enforce its rights in
respect of the secured asset during a period during which creditors' claims are verified. The verification process takes
place within a period between 5 and 30 days from the deadline for the declaration of claims, as determined by the court.

As an exception to the above rules, the Belgian Financial Collateral Act of December 15, 2004 ("Loi relative
_aux sûretés financières"/"Wet Financiële Zekerheden"), implementing the Financial Collateral Directive (2002/47/EC),_
provides that the enforcement rights of the creditors benefiting from certain types of financial collateral (including a
pledge over the financial instrument, e.g., a share pledge), such as the Security Agent, are not suspended if the agreement
creating the financial collateral was signed before the opening of the judicial reorganization or bankruptcy or, if after,
only to the extent that the creditor could not legitimately know that the company has filed for bankruptcy. However, a
court has decided to suspend the rights of a pledgee during judicial reorganization, arguing that the enforcement of a
pledge during the moratorium would be abusive.

Moreover, to the extent that the Belgian bankruptcy law applies, a legal act, as listed below, performed by the
collateral provider during the "suspect period", which can span up to six months before a bankruptcy judgment and in
specific cases more than six months (see further under "Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and the security interests and certain insolvency law considerations—Applicable insolvency laws—Belgian_
_insolvency law"), can be challenged and declared void after a bankruptcy declaration:_

    - any transfer of movable or immovable property without consideration and any transaction where the
consideration paid by the bankrupt company significantly exceeds what it received in return;

    - security interests granted if they were intended to secure a debt which existed prior to the date on which
the security interested was granted;

    - any payments, in whatever form, (i.e., cash, in-kind or by way of set-off) of any debt not yet due and
any payments other than in cash or in monetary instruments (e.g., checks, promissory notes, etc.); and

    - any payment of matured debts or a transaction entered into by the bankrupt company when the
counterparty was aware of the cessation of payments of the company and the transaction proves
detrimental to the company's estate.

Whenever the Collateral provider enters into a transaction or makes a payment that proves fraudulent towards its
creditors, such transaction or payment will be declared void, even if the transaction or payment took place before the
suspect period (see further "Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interest
_and certain insolvency law considerations")._

_Luxembourg law_

NH Finance S.A. is formed and existing under the laws of Luxembourg, and as such any insolvency
proceedings applicable to such a company are in principle governed by Luxembourg law to the extent that the COMI as
defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation is located in Luxembourg. The insolvency laws of Luxembourg may not be as
favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you may be
familiar. See “Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interest and certain
_insolvency law considerations”._

_Italian law_

NH Italia S.p.A. is incorporated in the Republic of Italy and, in case of an insolvency event affecting this entity,
it may be declared bankrupt by the Bankruptcy Court of the district where it has its “main place of business” in Italy
(such is the place of the management and administrative center of the business, which in turn coincides - unless proven
otherwise - with the registered office of the company). Any transfer of the main place of business in the year prior the
filing of the bankruptcy petition is disregarded for the purpose of determining the venue and jurisdiction of the
bankruptcy proceedings. Furthermore, according to Article 9, paragraph 3, of Italian Bankruptcy Law, if NH Italia S.p.A.

86


-----

has its main place of business abroad can be declared bankrupt in Italy, even if a declaration of bankruptcy has been
rendered abroad. Furthermore, the relocation of the business to a foreign country does not exclude the jurisdiction of
Italian courts, if it occurred after the filing of a petition for bankruptcy or the request of the Public Prosecutor.

In Italy, the courts play an important role in the insolvency process and in-court procedures may be materially

more complex and time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be
familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy.

The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and restructure its

business protecting, where possible, the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claims. In
case of the extraordinary administration procedure (governed by Legislative Decree No. 270 of July 8, 1999, or, upon
certain eligibility criteria of the debtor, Legislative Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, converted, with modifications,
into Law No. 39 of February 18, 2004), an additional primary aim is to maintain employment. These aims have often
been balanced by selling businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the
businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been repeatedly amended with a view to promoting
rescue procedures rather than liquidation, and a focus on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses
and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options.

Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency

(insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors.
Insolvency occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they become due. This must be a
permanent, and not a temporary, status of insolvency in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent.

In cases where a company is in distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its

creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible to being reviewed by a court in
the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions.

The restructuring and bankruptcy alternatives set forth are available under Italian Bankruptcy Law to companies

which are (i) facing financial difficulties, (ii) in a state of temporary crisis or (iii) insolvent. See “Limitations on validity
_and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interest and certain insolvency law considerations” for_
further information.

_German law_

NH Central Europe GmbH & Co. KG, NH Hotelbetriebs.-u. Dienstleistungs, GmbH, NH Hotelbetriebs-u

Entwicklungs, GmbH, NH Hoteles Deutschland GmbH and JOLLY HOTELS DEUTSCHLAND GmbH are incorporated
in the Federal Republic of Germany and, in case of an insolvency event affecting any of these entities, insolvency or
restructuring proceedings may be initiated in Germany to the extent that the center of main interests ("COMI") of the
companies provided for under EU Regulation 1346/2000 is located in Germany.

German insolvency proceedings may limit the enforcement of guarantees. The insolvency court may prohibit or

suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the insolvent companies' assets during preliminary
proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue
their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with
the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code. Any judicial enforcement action brought against the insolvent company
by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered
by a court, with respect to assets other than real estate also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the
time when insolvency proceedings commence). See "Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees
_and the security interests and certain insolvency law considerations—Applicable insolvency laws—German insolvency_
_law"._

Under German law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees given by it

during a certain legally specified period (the "hardening period") that can span from one month to ten years could be
subject to potential challenges by an appointed insolvency administrator, preliminary insolvency administrator or, in
certain cases, other creditors under the German Insolvency Act. In the absence of insolvency proceedings, creditors may
challenge guarantees under the Act of Avoidance. If challenged successfully, the guarantee may become unenforceable.
To the extent that the grant of any Note Guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the Note
Guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Note Guarantee. The holders of the Notes may
also be required to repay any amounts received with respect to such Note Guarantee. See "Limitations on validity and
_enforceability of Notes Guarantees granted by any German subsidiaries—Hardening periods and fraudulent transfer"._

**_We may not be able to raise the funds necessary to finance and offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of_**
**_certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture, and the change of control provisions_**
**_contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate_**
**_events._**

Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events as described in the Indenture, we will be required to
offer to repurchase all the Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of
purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. The requirement that we offer to repurchase
the Notes upon a change of control is limited only to the transactions specified in the definition of "Change of Control"
within the Indenture. See "Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control". If a
change of control were to occur requiring such offer, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds at the
time of any such event, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the
outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Indenture, the Senior Secured RCF Agreement, the COVID Related ICO
Facilities, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other then existing contractual obligations would allow us to make the
required repurchases. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.
Additionally, certain change of control events would entitle any lender under the Senior Secured RCF Agreement to
cancel its commitment thereunder and to declare any amounts owed to it due and payable. Following a change of control,
any lender under the Senior Secured RCF Agreement may declare the amounts owed to it due and payable, which could
in turn trigger an event of default under the Indenture. See "Description of certain financing arrangements—Senior
_Secured RCF Agreement". The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to a change of control offer could cause a default under_
our outstanding indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. If an event constituting a change of control
occurs at a time when we are prohibited from repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under or
holders of such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such
prohibition. If such consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, or if we are unable to refinance such borrowings,
we will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes.

The source of funds for any repurchase required as a result of any such event may be available cash or cash
generated from operating activities or other sources, including borrowings, third-party financing, sales of assets and sales
of equity or funds provided by subsidiaries. Sufficient funds may not be available at the time of any such events to make
any required repurchases of the Notes tendered, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain third-party
financing.

Any failure by us to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in
turn, constitute an event of default under the Senior Secured RCF, and may constitute a default under certain other
indebtedness. See "Description of the Notes—Change of Control".

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the
event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction
involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or
beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a "Change of Control" as defined in the Indenture. Except as
described under "Description of the Notes—Change of Control", the Indenture will not contain provisions that would
require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger,
recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of "Change of Control" in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of
case law interpreting the phrase "all or substantially all", there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of "all or substantially all" of the Issuer's assets and its restricted subsidiaries
taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is
required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_You may be unable to enforce judgments against us, the Guarantors or our respective directors and officers._**

The Issuer is not, and the Guarantors (other than Jolly Hotels USA, Inc.) are not, incorporated in the United
States. In addition, most of our assets are outside the United States and all the Group's directors and officers live outside
the United States, primarily in Spain. The Issuer's and the Guarantors' auditors are also organized outside the United
States. Although we and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any
action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on these
directors and executive officers or the auditors. Furthermore, because all or substantially all the assets of these persons
are located outside the United States, it may not be possible to enforce judgments obtained in courts in the United States
predicated upon civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States against these persons.

88

Additionally, there is doubt as to the enforceability in many foreign jurisdictions, including Spain and Luxembourg, of
civil liabilities based upon the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States against
the Issuer, the Guarantors, the directors and management and any experts named in this Offering Memorandum who are
not residents of the United States. See "Service of process and enforcement of judgments".

This Offering Memorandum refers to the Duff & Phelps Report, a valuation report provided by a third party
with respect to the Collateral. Property and asset valuations, including those used in the Duff & Phelps Report, are
prepared on the basis of various assumptions, estimates and projections. In particular, the Duff & Phelps Report is based
upon, in part, information provided by management and certain assumptions, including but not limited to the assumptions
that (i) the information provided by us is a fair representation of the appraised properties and assets as of December 31,
2020 for the Mortgage Properties and the Share Collateral, (ii) we, or the entity of which we are a shareholder, have valid
title to the appraised properties and assets, (iii) the property rights in the appraised properties and assets is good and
marketable, (iv) there are no encumbrances on the appraised properties and assets that cannot be cleared through normal
processes and (v) the relevant appraised properties and assets’ business is assumed to continue on going-concern. The
valuations are also based upon our financial forecasts which reflect our judgment, based upon present circumstances and
assuming certain conditions and actions by us. The assumptions or projections used, estimates made or procedures
followed in the Duff & Phelps Report may not be correct, accurate or complete. Actual results may differ materially from
the assumptions and projections used and estimates made in the Duff & Phelps Report, including changes in the demand
for our hotel rooms, changes to our commercial plan and changes in the global economy. In addition, the valuation of our
properties may suffer severe devaluation due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Other appraisers may reach different valuations of our property portfolio and assets. Moreover, the value
determined in the Duff & Phelps Report could significantly differ to the amount that would be obtained from the actual
sale of the Collateral, especially in a distressed or liquidation scenario or if the properties are sold on an individual basis.
For more information, see "—Risks relating to our business and industry—The value of our properties reflected on our
_balance sheet and in this Offering Memorandum and the book value of our hotels and assets included in this Offering_
_Memorandum is based in part upon the results of third-party valuations, and because property and asset valuation is_
_inherently subjective and uncertain, the projections or assumptions used, estimates made or procedures followed in the_
_third-party valuation of our properties and assets may not be correct, accurate or complete and may suffer severe_
_devaluations due to the COVID-19 pandemic"._

Furthermore, Duff & Phelps based its valuation of the NH Italia Shares upon the income approach using the
DCF method.

In delivering the Duff & Phelps Report to us, Duff & Phelps has stated that it does not accept or assume any
liability to any investors in the Notes with respect to either the contents of such report or any statements or conclusions
derived from such report. Duff & Phelps has limited assets and limited professional indemnity insurance. Furthermore,
no parent or affiliated entity of Duff & Phelps, nor any director, officer, employee or consultant of Duff & Phelps,
assumes responsibility for the conclusions or contents of the Duff & Phelps Report.

**_Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro, the potential re-introduction of individual currencies within_**
**_the Eurozone, or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely, could adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future
financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse
economic and political circumstances in individual Member States. Since 2015, the stability of the Eurozone has been
further undermined by the refugee crisis, as EU member states and adjacent countries have struggled to cope with the
significant flows of migrants trying to access the Eurozone. In addition, On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held an
in or out referendum on the United Kingdom's membership within the European Union, the result of which favored the
exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (''Brexit''). On January 31, 2020, Brexit became effective and the
United Kingdom entered into a transition period from January 31, 2020 to December 31, 2020 during which the
European Union treated the United Kingdom as if it were still a member of the European Union (the ''Transition Period'').
Following the expiry of the Transition Period, the United Kingdom ceased to be treated as a member of European Union
at 23:00 on December 31, 2020. The implications of the United Kingdom withdrawing from the European Union and the
impact this will have on our business are similarly unclear. Brexit has given rise to calls for certain regions within the
United Kingdom to preserve their place in the European Union by separating from the United Kingdom. It is also
possible that other members of the European Union could hold a similar referendum regarding their membership within
the European Union in the future. The uncertainty that has been created by the British referendum and the exit of the

-----

United Kingdom from the European Union could adversely affect European and worldwide economic and market
conditions and could contribute to further instability in global financial markets. Such volatility and negative economic
impact could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and
could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes. These and other concerns could lead to the re-introduction of
individual currencies in one or more Member States, including Spain or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible
dissolution of the euro entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of
euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. We cannot assure you that the official
exchange rate at which the Notes may be redenominated would accurately reflect their value in euro. These potential
developments, or market perceptions concerning these developments and related issues, could adversely affect the value
of the Notes.

**_There is no existing public trading market for the Notes and the ability to transfer them is limited, which may_**
**_adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

The Notes are a new issue. There is no existing trading market for the Notes and there can be no assurance that a
trading market for the Notes will develop. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in us will lead to the
development of an active trading market or how liquid that trading market might become. Although the Initial Purchasers
have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and may stop at any time.
The market price of our Notes may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:

    - prevailing interest rates;

    - the market for similar securities;

    - changes in demand, the supply or pricing of our hotel rooms and other services and products;

    - general economic conditions;

    - the activities of competitors;

    - our quarterly or annual earnings or those of our competitors;

    - investors' perceptions of us and the hotel industry;

    - the failure of securities analysts to cover our Notes after this Offering or changes in financial estimates
by analysts;

    - the public's reaction to our press releases or our other public announcements;

    - future sales of Notes; and

    - other factors described under these "Risk factors".

As a result of these factors, you may not be able to resell your Notes at or above the initial offering price, or at
all. In addition, securities trading markets experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been
unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of a particular company. Historically, the market for
non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the price of
securities similar to the Notes. These broad market fluctuations and industry factors may materially reduce the market
price of our Notes, regardless of our operating performance. If an active trading market does not develop, you may not be
able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, or at all.

Although an application has been or will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF, we cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed.
Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to trading on the Euro MTF,
failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes from the Luxembourg Stock Exchange may have a material
effect on a holder's ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market.

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes in the future which could adversely affect the
liquidity of the Notes.

**_There are risks related to withholding tax in Spain, including in connection with the delivery of certain_**
**_documentation by the Paying Agent._**

Under Spanish tax regulations established by Royal Decree 1065/2007, of July 27, as amended by Royal Decree
1145/2011, of July 29 ("Royal Decree 1065/2007") and the First Additional Provision of Law 10/2014, of June 26 ("Law
10/2014"), the Issuer will not be required to levy any withholding tax in Spain on interest payments and income derived
from the redemption or repayment paid by Issuer in respect of the Notes only if certain requirements are met, including
that the Issuer receives from the Paying Agent, in a timely manner, a duly executed and completed statement providing
certain details relating to the Notes (the "Payment Statement").

This information must be provided by the Paying Agent to the Issuer, before the close of business on the
business day immediately preceding the date on which any payment of interest, principal or of any amounts in respect of
the early redemption of the Notes (each a "Payment Date") is due.

It is expected that the Paying Agent and the Issuer will follow certain procedures to facilitate and ensure the
timely reception by the Issuer of a duly executed and completed Payment Statement in connection with each payment
under the Notes. If such procedures are not followed, however, income paid by the Issuer in respect of the Notes will be
subject to withholding tax in Spain, at the current rate of 19%, and the payments the Issuer makes in respect of the Notes
will be net of such withholding tax. See "Certain tax considerations—Spanish tax considerations" for a more detailed
explanation.

However, if such Spanish withholding tax is made because of the failure by the Paying Agent to deliver a duly
executed and completed Payment Statement to the Issuer, affected beneficial owners of the Notes will receive a refund of
the amount withheld directly from the Paying Agent, with no need for action on their part, if the Paying Agent submits a
duly executed and completed Payment Statement to the Issuer no later than the 10th calendar day of the month
immediately following the relevant Payment Date.

The paying agency agreement provides that the Paying Agent will, to the extent applicable, comply with the
relevant procedures to deliver the required information concerning the Notes to the Issuer in a timely manner. See
_"Certain tax considerations —Spanish tax considerations —_ _Compliance with certain requirements in connection with_
_income payments"._

These procedures may be modified, amended or supplemented, among other reasons, to reflect a change in
applicable Spanish law, regulation, ruling or an administrative interpretation thereof. None of the Issuer or the Initial
Purchasers assumes any responsibility therefor.

Accordingly, while the Notes are represented by one or more global notes, are admitted to trading on the Euro
MTF of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, and deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
holders of the Notes must rely on such procedures in order to receive payments under the Notes free of any Spanish
withholding tax, to the extent applicable. Prospective investors should note that neither the Issuer nor the Initial
Purchasers accept any responsibility relating to compliance by the Paying Agent with the procedures established for the
timely provision by the Paying Agent of a duly executed and completed Payment Statement in connection with each
payment of income under the Notes. Accordingly, neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers will be liable for any
damage or loss suffered by any beneficial owner who would otherwise be entitled to an exemption from Spanish
withholding tax because of the Paying Agent's failure to comply with these procedures or because of these procedures
prove ineffective. Moreover, the Issuer will not pay any additional amounts with respect to any such withholding.
Therefore, to the extent a payment of income in respect of the Notes is not exempt from Spanish withholding tax,
including due to any failure by the Paying Agent to deliver a duly executed and completed Payment Statement, beneficial
owners may have to apply directly to the Spanish tax authorities for any refund to which they may be entitled (with no
responsibility for the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers).

Accordingly, to the extent a payment of income in respect of the Notes is not exempt from Spanish withholding
tax, holders (that are beneficial owners) of the Notes may have to apply directly to the Spanish tax authorities for any
refund to which they may be entitled. Noteholders must seek their own advice to ensure that they comply with all
procedures to ensure the correct tax treatment of their Notes.

**_Potential impact by the German interest barrier rules._**

A significant amount of the annual refinancing expenses (interest payments and further expenses which may
qualify as interest expenses within the meaning of the interest barrier rules) may not be (immediately) deductible for
German tax purposes under the German interest barrier rules (Zinsschranke). The interest barrier rules generally provide

91


-----

for a limitation on the deduction of a business' net interest expenses in a financial year to an amount equal to 30% of its
tax adjusted EBITDA in the respective financial year. This may have an adverse effect on our financial situation and thus
on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and could cause the market price of the Notes to decline.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns by reference
to a currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other
factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which investors
measure the return on their investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control.
Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments
could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to
investors when the return on such Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the
return on their investments. Investments in the Notes by U.S. Holders (as defined in "Certain tax considerations—
_Material U.S. federal income tax considerations") may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign_
exchange gains or losses, if any. See "Certain tax considerations—Material U.S. federal income tax considerations".

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at which they may be_**
**_sold._**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been registered under, and we are not obliged to register the Notes
or the Notes Guarantees under, the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. See "Important
_information for investors". We have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register any of the Notes or the Notes_
Guarantees, and do not have any intention to do so. You may not offer the Notes for sale in the United States except
pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws, or pursuant to an effective registration statement. The Notes and the Indenture will
contain provisions that will restrict the Notes from being offered, sold or otherwise transferred except pursuant to the
exemptions available pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S, or other exceptions under the U.S. Securities Act.
Furthermore, we have not registered the Notes under any other country's securities laws. It is your obligation to ensure
that your offers and sales of the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities
laws. See "Important information for investors". In addition, by its acceptance of delivery of any Notes, the holder
thereof agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor accounts for which it has purchased the Notes that it shall
not transfer the Notes in an amount less than €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 thereafter.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to_**
**_revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not
reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein and other
factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and
may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a
credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. For example, since the
outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, both Fitch and Moody's have downgraded our credit ratings. Any suspension,
reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies
may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading
of the Notes.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant_**
**_clearing system to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until Notes are issued in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes are issued in
exchange for book-entry interests, which may occur only in very limited circumstances, owners of book-entry interests
will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary of Euroclear or Clearstream, or its nominee,
is the sole registered holder of the global notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect
of the relevant global notes representing the Notes will be made to the Paying Agent for further credit to Euroclear or
Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants' accounts that hold book- entry interests in the
global notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the
common depositary of Euroclear or Clearstream, or its nominee, we will have no responsibility or liability for the
payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a
book-entry interest in the relevant Notes, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and

92


-----

if you are not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your
interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct rights to act
upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own a
book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from
Euroclear or Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for
the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any matters or on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the relevant definitive
registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted
from acting through Euroclear or Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through
Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

_31, 2021 and for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, have been derived from the unaudited condensed_
_interim consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2021 which were_
_subject to limited review by PricewaterhouseCoopers Auditores, S.L. and have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34._
_This summary financial information is not necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future period or_
_our financial condition at any future date._

_IFRS 16 came into force on January 1, 2019, replacing IAS 17. Our financial statements as of and for the year_
_ended December 31, 2019 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS 16. The Group decided to apply the modified_
_retrospective method, as described in Note 2.1.1 of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31,_
_2019. Our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 have consequently not been restated._
_According to IFRS 16, upon entry into a lease, a liability in an amount equal to the present value of the lease instalments,_
_as well as an asset representing the right-of-use of the underlying asset during the lease term, must be recognized on the_
_balance sheet. The liability includes fixed instalments and those that are in substance fixed installments, as well as_
_variable instalments depending on an index or interest rate._

_In accordance with IFRS 5—Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, as described in_
_Note 12 of our financial statements as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, certain non-_
_strategic assets and liabilities undergoing divestment with committed sales plans were reclassified as "Non Current_
_Assets and Liabilities Classified as Held for Sale" in the consolidated balance sheet and as "Profits (Loss) for the Year_
_from Discontinued Operations Net of Tax" in the comprehensive consolidated income statement. The contribution of such_
_assets and liabilities was accordingly excluded from all other line items in the comprehensive consolidated income_
_statement and consolidated balance sheet. As described in Note 16 of our financial statements as of and for the year_
_ended December 31, 2020, the Group decided to reclassify as continuing operations certain assets which had been_
_classified as discontinued operations in the prior year._

_According to IAS 29, Argentina became a hyperinflationary economy during 2018 and our financial statements_
_as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 onwards have been prepared applying this standard. Relatedly, our_
_financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 recorded a higher consolidated result derived from_
_hyperinflation at our Argentine subsidiaries, when such recording should have been made directly in reserves for net tax._
_Our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 were not restated to reclassify such amount;_
_however, such amount was reclassified from profit or loss to equity in the comparative figures for 2018, which are_
_included in our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, as described in Note 2.2 of our_
_financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019._

assigned to the Company and €3.2 million to non-controlling interests). This reclassification has no impact on
total equity and the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 were not restated. The
financial information presented herein is extracted from the comparative period presented in our consolidated
financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019.

**Management's discussion and analysis of**
**financial condition and results of operations**

_The following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition (1) as of and for_
_the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 as derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the_
_Group for the same periods, except as otherwise indicated, in each case prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by_
_the European Union, and (2) as of March 31, 2021 and for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, have been_
_derived from the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements of the Group for the three months ended_
_March 31, 2021 which were subject to limited review by PricewaterhouseCoopers Auditores, S.L. and have been_
_prepared in accordance with IAS 34._

_IFRS 16 came into force on January 1, 2019, replacing IAS 17. Our financial statements as of and for the year_
_ended December 31, 2019 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS 16. The Group decided to apply the modified_
_retrospective method, as described in Note 2.1.1 of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31,_
_2019. Our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 have consequently not been restated._
_According to IFRS 16, upon entry into a lease, a liability in an amount equal to the present value of the lease instalments,_
_as well as an asset representing the right-of-use of the underlying asset during the lease term, must be recognized on the_
_balance sheet. The liability includes fixed instalments and those that are in substance fixed installments, as well as_
_variable instalments depending on an index or interest rate._

_In accordance with IFRS 5—Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, as described in_
_Note 12 of our financial statements as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, certain non-_
_strategic assets and liabilities undergoing divestment with committed sales plans were reclassified as "Non Current_
_Assets and Liabilities Classified as Held for Sale" in the consolidated balance sheet and as "Profits (Loss) for the Year_
_from Discontinued Operations Net of Tax" in the comprehensive consolidated income statement. The contribution of such_
_assets and liabilities was accordingly excluded from all other line items in the comprehensive consolidated income_
_statement and consolidated balance sheet. As described in Note 16 of our financial statements as of and for the year_
_ended December 31, 2020, the Group decided to reclassify as continuing operations certain assets which had been_
_classified as discontinued operations in the prior year._

_According to IAS 29, Argentina became a hyperinflationary economy during 2018 and our financial statements_
_as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 onwards have been prepared applying this standard. Relatedly, our_
_financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 recorded a higher consolidated result derived from_
_hyperinflation at our Argentine subsidiaries, when such recording should have been made directly in reserves for net tax._
_Our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 were not restated to reclassify such amount;_
_however, such amount was reclassified from profit or loss to equity in the comparative figures for 2018, which are_
_included in our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, as described in Note 2.2 of our_
_financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019._

_The following discussion includes a geographical breakdown of our financial performance, which is based upon_
_our consolidated financial statements, and a geographical breakdown of our key operating performance indicators,_
_including RevPAR, Occupancy and ADR. Our geographical breakdown is as follows: (1) Spain, which includes Spain,_
_Portugal, France, Andorra, Tunisia and the United States; (2) Italy; (3) Central Europe, which includes Austria, the_
_Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Switzerland; (4) Benelux, which includes Belgium,_
_Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Ireland and the United Kingdom; and (5) Latin America, which includes Argentina,_
_Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Haiti, Mexico and Uruguay. See "Important information for investors—Other_
_data—Other operating measures"._

**Overview**

We are a leading international hotel operator and we are ranked among the top ten largest hotel chains in Europe
by number of hotel rooms, according to the latest available Hospitality On report. As of March 31, 2021, we operated
355 hotels consisting of 54,806 hotel rooms in 29 countries.

101


-----

Based on a report by an independent market research firm, and measured by number of hotel rooms in
operation, as of December 2019, we were the third largest hotel chain in the Netherlands, the fourth largest in Italy and
Belgium, the fifth largest in Spain and Portugal and the eighth largest in Germany. Of the 355 hotels we operated as of
March 31, 2021, we owned 73 (or 22% by number of hotel rooms), we leased 229 (or 65% by number of hotel rooms)
and we managed 53 hotels (or 14% by number of hotel rooms) owned or leased by third parties pursuant to management
agreements. We believe that our versatile operating structure and our geographic diversity enhance our resilience to
industry cycles while also providing us with flexibility to take advantage of future growth opportunities.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, our net turnover was €320.4 million and our Adjusted EBITDA
was negative €426.5 million. Our net turnover and Adjusted EBITDA increased from €1,613.4 million and
€264.5 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2018 to €1,708.1 million and €319.4 million, respectively,
in the year ended December 31, 2019. Our net turnover and Adjusted EBITDA decreased from €277.0 million and
negative €31.4 million, respectively, in the three months ended March 31, 2020, to €61.2 million and negative
€112.3 million, respectively, in the three months ended March 31, 2021. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, our
Occupancy, ADR and RevPAR were 14.3%, €65.5 and €9.4, respectively. For further information on these performance
measures, see "Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Key factors
_affecting our financial condition and results of operation—Occupancy, Average Daily Rate (ADR) and Revenue per_
_Available Room (RevPAR)"._

We have a centralized business model that allows us to provide a consistent level of service to customers across
hotels in different regions and to achieve economies of scale. Our central corporate and regional offices provide our
hotels with a wide variety of key functions, including sales, reservations, marketing, administrative and IT systems.

We have strengthened our brand proposition by reorganizing our hotels into an upper-upscale segment, an
upscale segment and a mid-tier segment and we have developed the following core dedicated brands, each tailored to
represent a clearly defined level of service, quality and value:

    - _NH Collection is our upper-upscale urban segment brand, which consists of our best properties and is_
designed for clients that are willing to pay a premium for higher quality products and services;

    - _NHOW is our upper-upscale design brand, for which we do not have a standard design applied across_
all hotels. Instead, we have combined new forms of contemporary architecture, design and luxury by
prestigious architects and interior designers to create an elegant and extravagant experience for our
guests; and

    - _NH Hotels remains our core brand for our upscale segment hotels, which consists of urban hotels with_
higher standards and more detail-oriented product and service levels, and our mid-tier urban segment
hotels, which focus on delivering value and comfort for our customers.

Since their public tender offer in 2018, we have benefitted from the industry knowledge and support of MINT,
which operates over 172 hotels and resorts across Asia, Australia, Africa, the Middle East and South America. As a result
of the integration of the Group into Minor Hotels (an affiliate of MINT), the parties have agreed to a joint brand
positioning for all markets and segments, on the basis of the reciprocal master licensing agreement signed between the
parties on February 7, 2019 allowing each party to use the other party's corresponding commercial brands in the
geographical areas where each party operates. The brands covered by this master licensing agreement comprise Anantara,
Avani, Tivoli and Oaks (in each case with Minor Hotels as licensor) and the brands NH Collection, NH Hotels and
NHOW (in each case with the Group as licensor). As a result of this master licensing agreement, we have increased the
number of brands we offer in the luxury and upscale segment and currently operate six hotels in Europe under the luxury
Anantara brand and 10 hotels under the upper-upscale Tivoli brand:

    - Anantara is an award-winning and world-renowned Asian luxury brand offering both design and
service-led timeless experiences. Positioned in key markets around the globe, Anantara hotels, resorts
and spas open up a window to the modern character of their destination, upholding world-class
operational standards to make every stay uniquely personal; and

    - _Tivoli is a collection of upscale and deluxe properties in prime locations around the world. Tivoli is_
now a global brand, with destinations ranging from idyllic beach settings in Brazil to cosmopolitan city
spots across Europe and luxury locations in the Middle East. Every Tivoli hotel is unique. Some are
inspired by exotic surroundings, others offer a touch of metropolitan luxury. Each one delivers
consistent premium service combined with impeccable taste and comfort.

Since 2013, we have implemented various upgrades and refined our brands across our operations. This has
included investing in upgraded basic facilities, such as flat screen televisions and rain showers, and refining our dining
and beverage options. We have worked to align our hotels with particular brand aesthetics to create a comfortable and
standardized experience for our customers. We have also implemented a centralized pricing strategy which organizes
price by destination, allowing us to structure relative prices among our various hotels in each destination, and by room
type. Through this pricing mechanism, guests may choose to upgrade for more desirable features, such as a better view.
We have refurbished several of our leased and owned hotels, which have generally shown improved Occupancy,
RevPAR and ADR as a result, and have overhauled our IT systems, launching a new website and completing the
migration of our back office systems to SAP, an enterprise software system which integrates our front and back office
and computer reservation systems, in all business units ("BUs").

In the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year, all regions reported a decrease in RevPAR,
which is principally due to the low levels of occupancy beginning in March 2020 across all regions due to the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic. The second quarter of the year was the most affected quarter during the pandemic due to
lockdowns in various countries, temporary hotel closures and travel restrictions, which were reinstated in the last few
months of 2020. In particular, for our hotels in Spain, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by 71.4%, 22.9% and 63.0%,
respectively, in 2020 compared with 2019. For our hotels in Central Europe, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by
67.3%, 16.4% and 60.9%, respectively, in 2020 compared with 2019. For our hotels in Italy, RevPAR, ADR and
Occupancy fell by 75.4%, 22.3% and 68.3%, respectively, in 2020 compared with 2019. For our hotels in Benelux,
RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by 74.2%, 18.2% and 68.4%, respectively, in 2020 compared with 2019 and, in Latin
America, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by 76.7%, 21.7% and 70.3%, respectively, in 2020 compared with 2019,
which was also due to the negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

In the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter in 2020, all regions reported a decrease in RevPAR,
which is principally due to the low levels of occupancy beginning in March 2020 across all regions. The first quarter of
2021 has been affected by lockdowns in various countries, temporary hotel closures and travel restrictions, which largely
remained in effect during the beginning of 2021. In particular, for our hotels in Spain, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell
by 71.2%, 32.7% and 57.3%, respectively in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. For our
hotels in Central Europe, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by 88.4%, 29.6% and 83.5% respectively in the first quarter
of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. For our hotels in Italy, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by 65.9%,
25.6% and 54.2%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. For our hotels in
Benelux, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by 88.2%, 28.7% and 83.5%, respectively in the first quarter of 2021 as
compared to the same period in 2020 and in Latin America, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by 72.5%, 34.1% and
58.2% respectively, in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, which was also due to the
negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

We actively manage our asset portfolio, including our 73 owned hotels which had a book value of €1.3 billion as
of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, although we believe that the actual market value of such assets is higher, due
to the fact that prices at which we have been able to sell our assets in recent years have been typically higher than their
respective book values. Between June 2020 and February 2021, 30 owned hotels were appraised by third parties and
were assigned a market value of approximately €875 million, while their book value as of December 31, 2020 is recorded
as approximately €593 million. This means that the market value for those 30 appraised hotels exceeds their book value
by approximately 48%. We regularly evaluate the performance of individual hotels to identify underperforming
properties, and aim to terminate, or not renew, lease agreements and management agreements for underperforming
hotels, in particular if they contain undesirable terms (such as management agreements with costly performance
guarantees), as well as to sell certain of our underperforming owned hotels and redirect our resources to markets and
hotels where our operations have been successful. One of the ways in which we actively redirect our resources is to
increase the proportion of our operations conducted under management arrangements in order to take advantage of the
less capital intensive nature of management arrangements.

In addition, we are actively working to continue to increase Occupancy and Average Daily Rates through
selective investments, including refurbishment of existing hotels and opening new hotels. We also intend to complete the
streamlining of our operating platforms to increase efficiency. To date, we have migrated most of our back office systems
to SAP, and we have invested in the development of our website (with a focus on a mobile-friendly interface as our
customers increasingly access our website through their mobile devices) with increased functionality in order to increase
the proportion of direct bookings. In the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, the proportion of
revenue generated from our website grew from 11.5% to 14.3%. We also seek to reallocate our resources to grow in the
markets where we believe there is increasing demand for hotel rooms and where we currently have limited presence.
During 2020, we opened 11 hotels with 1,966 rooms in markets where we believe there is increasing demand for hotel
rooms and we closed 17 hotels with 3,866 rooms.

-----

As of March 31, 2021, we have entered into agreements to operate 20 new hotels with 3,739 rooms (our
"committed pipeline hotels"), which are expected to commence operations mainly between 2021 and 2023. We will
operate our committed pipeline hotels under lease and management agreements with third-party hotel owners and most of
our committed pipeline hotels will be operated under our core NH Hotels and NH Collection brands. We estimate that we
will invest a total of approximately €30 million into our committed pipeline hotels between 2021 and 2023.

We are a public limited company (sociedad anónima) incorporated under the laws of Spain and listed on the
Spanish Stock Exchanges with an authorized share capital of €784,360,486 consisting of 392,180,243 shares as of
March 31, 2021. Our market capitalization was €1.6 billion as of June 11, 2021.

The following charts set forth the geographic breakdown of our net turnover for the twelve months ended March

**The COVID-19 pandemic and related measures**

Since the start of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-March 2020, lockdowns, travel restrictions
and social distancing measures have severely impacted the hospitality demand in Europe and other regions in which we
operate. From March to end of May 2020, approximately 95% of hotels in our portfolio were temporarily closed, and
those which remained open had limited activity, remaining open primarily for charitable purposes. As a result, the second
quarter of 2020 was our most severely impacted quarter during the pandemic, with an extremely low level of demand. In
many cases, temporary closures of our hotels have been mandatory under local laws and regulations.

As a result of the lockdown across Europe and other regions in which we operate, during the months of April
and May 2020, RevPAR remained severely reduced as compared to prior to the pandemic, as booking rates decreased
significantly due to travel restrictions, lockdowns and cancellation of events. As a consequence, only 1% of the hotel
rooms in our portfolio were occupied during the month of April 2020. Starting at the end of May 2020, we gradually
reopened our portfolio during the summer months, with approximately 80% open in August and September 2020, until
successive waves of COVID-19, primarily in Europe, resulted in our hotels closing again from October, with only 60%
of hotels in our portfolio open at the end of December 2020. However, since the beginning of 2021, the gradual roll out
of vaccines, together with the progressive easing of restrictions in certain European countries, has allowed us to
accelerate the reopening of our portfolio. As such, at the end of May 2021, approximately 78% of hotels in our portfolio
were open.

As a result of such temporary closures and low Occupancy and RevPAR, our net turnover decreased to
€536.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from €1,708.1 million in the prior year, and our EBITDA decreased
to €0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to €567.0 million in the prior year.

In 2020, the Group implemented "Feel Safe at NH" at all its hotels. This new plan, with measures approved by
experts, is intended to address the challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Group has reviewed its operational
procedures and made nearly 700 adaptations to its operating standards to safeguard the health and safety of our guests
and employees worldwide. Grouped into 10 main lines of action and supported by specialists in various fields, the
measures implemented include the digitization of hotel services, sanitation processes, including social distancing
procedures and the use of personal protective equipment, among others. We also reached a collaboration agreement with
Société Générale de Surveillance ("SGS"), a world leader in inspection, analysis and certification, which allows us to
monitor the implementation of this protocol to verify that the Group's hotels are clean and safe environments.

Additionally, various initiatives were launched in 2020 to adapt to new travel trends:

    - _Extended stay: Discounts of up to 35% on stays from seven days, in order to incentivize guests to work_
away from home during a longer period or enjoy a longer holiday vacation;

    - _Smart spaces: New innovative business-to-business proposal with exclusive spaces to work and_
organize small business meetings, while taking advantage of all of the amenities at our hotels (such as a
day-use room, a fitness center and restaurants); and

    - _Hybrid meetings: Combining in person and virtual attendees to enhance the value of events, reaching a_
greater audience from a number of different locations.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a contingency plan to adapt our operations and
preserve liquidity where possible, including temporary lay-offs, reductions in hours and wages of employees at our hotels
and central offices, renegotiations with suppliers to reduce procurement costs, renegotiations with hotel proprietors to
reduce or defer fixed rent expenses, and reduction or deferral of planned or committed capital expenditures. As further
described below, at the end of April 2021, we also implemented a collective dismissal procedure at our central and
corporate services in Spain, following negotiations with employee representatives.

Given the lack of visibility on the speed of business recovery, the following measures have been implemented to
assure cost control and preserve liquidity and are expected to continue to remain in place in the short-term:

    - _Workforce: The Group has carried out temporary lay-offs, as well as reductions in hours and wages of_
employees at our hotels and central offices. These processes continued during the second half of 2020,
with a view to reducing the work force temporarily, and will continue during the first part of 2021 in
various countries. In February 2021, we announced our intention to initiate a collective dismissal
procedure in our central and corporate services in Spain, and the related agreement has since been
announced as part of the collective dismissal procedure and ratified by the Workers' Assembly. This
collective dismissal was implemented at the end of April 2021. This process in Spain is part of a larger
global plan being implemented in accordance with local legislation.

    - _Other Operating expenses:_

`o` The Group has negotiated with suppliers to reduce procurement costs, searched for lower-cost
alternative products and negotiated improvements in payment terms;

`o` All Group staff travel has been suspended since beginning of March 2020;

105


-----

`o` Suspension of non-priority consultancy advisory work from third parties, as well as employee
training; and

`o` Significant reduction in marketing and advertising costs, despite the need to incentivize revenues.

    - _Leases: Certain temporary reduction or deferrals of fixed rent expenses have been obtained since the_
second quarter of 2020, in light of the pandemic and hotel closure mandated by several European
governments. Additional negotiations are in progress with landlords for 2021.

    - _Capital expenditures: Investments were generally discontinued or canceled except those legally_
required or at an advanced stage. Capital expenditure (such as renovations, maintenance, IT and new
openings) in 2020 was approximately €100 million, or 50%, lower than originally planned. Capital
expenditures will continue to be limited throughout 2021. Our capital expenditure decreased to €14.9
million in the first quarter of 2021 from €34.0 million in the same period of 2020, representing a 56%
reduction. We plan to maintain limited capital expenditure through 2021.

    - _Dividend withdrawal: Withdrawal of the 2019 dividend proposal of €0.15 per share, which would have_
involved an estimated disbursement of approximately €59 million.

Through these cost reduction measures, in the nine months from April to December 2020, we have been able to
minimize our cost base and reduce our non-rent costs by approximately 61% and our costs including rents by
approximately 52%, compared to the same period in the prior year. Excluding perimeter changes, the decrease in total
rents amounted to approximately 32% over the same period, explained by the €63.6 million increase in our fixed rent
concessions and our lower variable rents. Due to our disciplined cost control, we were able to offset approximately 50%
of EBITDA decline in 2020. We have continued our effective cost reduction methods through the first quarter of 2021
and have successfully offset 69% of EBITDA decline as a result. Overall, since April 2020 until March 2021, we have
been able to minimize our cost base and reduce our non-rent costs by approximately 60% and our costs including rent by
approximately 51%, compared to the same period in the prior year, allowing us to offset approximately 54% of EBITDA
decline in the twelve months ended March 31, 2021. Likewise, in the first quarter of 2021, our average cash outflow was
approximately €29 million per month (75.5% of operating cash flow and 24.5% of investing and financial cash flow), a
reduction from our average cash outflow of approximately €42 million per month (67.9% of operating cash flow and
32.1% of investing and financial cash flow) in the year ended December 31, 2020.

With the roll-out of vaccines and the easing of travel restrictions, the Group anticipates renewed consumer
confidence and a return to travel to a certain extent. However, it is impossible to predict the change in demand and the
length of time it will take for the market to recover once people receive the vaccine and the pandemic subsides. As such,
the Group does not expect to see a material improvement in the short term. See, "Risk Factors―Risks relating to our
_business and industry―The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on our industry and business,_
_and may continue to have a significant negative impact in the future."_

**_Reopening and recovery strategy_**

Our flexible cost structure has allowed a gradual reopening according to demand with a focus on optimizing
profitability since the end of May. Starting at the end of May 2020, we gradually reopened our portfolio during the
summer months, with approximately 80% open in August and September 2020, until successive waves of COVID-19,
primarily in Europe, resulted in our hotels closing again from October, with only 60% of hotels in our portfolio open at
the end of December 2020. However, since the beginning of 2021, the gradual roll out of vaccines, together with the
progressive easing of restrictions in certain European countries, has allowed us to accelerate the reopening of our
portfolio. As such, at the end of May 2021, approximately 78% of hotels in our portfolio were open.

The recovery in domestic leisure demand is already noticeable and is gaining momentum as Europe increases its
vaccination rate and eases restrictions. We believe that the difficulties experienced in 2020 and in early 2021 are behind
us and that a gradual recovery will soon begin.

The Group plans to use its strong market positioning in the European countries, with excellent locations and
high brand awareness, in addition to increased domestic demand. Our recovery is expected to be initially driven by
domestic and intra-European leisure domestic demand as internationally mobility is expected to remain low. In 2019,
intra-European demand represented between 71 and 76% of our revenues, while domestic demand represented 67% in
Germany, 60% in Spain, 48% in Italy and 47% in the Netherlands during the same period. In addition, we believe that the
business-to-business group may take longer to recover, due to broader socio-economic factors relating to the pandemic

106

and, in particular, social distancing that restrict the size of events, subject to any advancements in the distribution of
vaccines or other scientific advances relating to COVID-19.

**Key factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations**

Beyond the COVID-19 pandemic discussed above, we consider the following factors, which are discussed
further below, as the key business drivers affecting our results of operations:

    - economic conditions;

    - portfolio and asset management;

    - Occupancy, Average Daily Rate ("ADR") and Revenue per Available Room ("RevPAR");

    - repositioning our brand and hotel portfolio and our refurbishment plan;

    - expenses;

    - cost savings initiative;

    - food and beverage sales;

    - seasonality and weather;

    - currency translation; and

    - repeat visitors and guest loyalty.

**_Economic Conditions_**

Our results of operations are affected by the level of consumer travel. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic
disrupted our business beginning in March 2020 and caused an immediate economic downturn. The economies of many
jurisdictions in which we operate continue to be severely affected. Given these economic uncertainties, we cannot predict
what the impact will be on overall travel and leisure spending, or more specifically, on our guest visitation, guest
spending, or other related trends. See, "Risk Factors―Risks relating to our business and industry―The COVID-19
_pandemic has had a significant negative impact on our industry and business, and may continue to have a significant_
_negative impact in the future."_

**_Portfolio and asset management_**

Our business incorporates three hotel operating models: we own hotels, we lease hotels from the owners and we
manage hotels owned or leased by third parties (including our franchise hotels). Our revenue mix and our risks and
results of operations are affected by the types of hotel contracts into which we enter. We seek to optimize the structure of
our hotel portfolio by monitoring the performance of our existing hotels and the expiry of our agreements relating to the
hotels that we lease or manage. As our portfolio matures, we seek to extract more value from our existing hotels by
renewing profitable agreements on more favorable terms, and we seek to exit hotel properties that fail to meet financial
targets or other criteria we have set. In the past, we have achieved significant long-term rent savings by renegotiating or
terminating unprofitable leases, primarily in Spain and Italy. We also seek to increase the proportion of our hotels
operated under "asset-light" management agreements, increase the weight of variable leases and improve the terms of our
management agreements and lease agreements and enhance resilience to industry cycles.

We also have sold certain of our hotels from time to time, and we may continue to sell, or sell and leaseback,
hotels as part of our asset management strategy. We have a strong record of opportunistically selling assets and achieving
capital gains on those assets. The following table summarizes our asset sales since 2010.

(1) The ratio of sale price to EBITDA in each case does not take into account corporate costs and is calculated on
the basis of EBITDA for the full fiscal year preceding the disposal, except in the case of the NH Grand Hotel
Krasnapolsky, which is calculated based upon EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2013.

(2) The Hilton portfolio consisted of three subsidiaries that each owned a hotel in Mexico, all of which were
operated under the Hilton brand. Additionally, the cancellation of three management agreements was included
in this transaction, which is taken into account in the calculations presented in this table.

(3) Other non-hotel assets consisted of the shops in the NH Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky.

(4) Represents the sale price with respect to the sale and leaseback of five hotels. In connection with this sale, we
exercised our option to purchase ten hotels we previously leased.

(5) Reflects the disposal of the Group's 25% interest in a joint venture that owns the Harrington Hotel.

(6) Minority interests consisted of a minority investment in a resort hotel in the Dominican Republic.

(7) Minority interests consisted of a minority investment in three hotels in Germany.

(8) Minority interests consisted of a minority investment in a managed hotel in Italy.

(9) Sale and lease back transaction.

Sales of certain of our hotels facilitate the repositioning of our business and also allow us to invest in our other
owned and leased properties.

Our portfolio and asset management may impact our net income. For example, in 2019, net income was
negatively impacted by non-recurring activity (negative €13 million) mainly explained by the impairment of a non-hotel
asset, partially offset by asset disposals. In 2018, net income benefitted from non-recurring activity (positive €32 million)
mainly from the net capital gains from asset rotation.

We regularly evaluate opportunities to expand, refurbish and upgrade our existing hotels to enhance our revenue
base and profitability and increase the value of our owned assets. On average, we expect to spend approximately 4% to
5% of our annual revenue from leased and owned hotels on the maintenance of our existing long-term leased hotels and
owned hotels, which amounts are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the asset. In addition to capitalized

108


-----

maintenance expenditure, each hotel has its own ongoing maintenance budget. Moreover, as part of our repositioning
initiative, we intend to more intensively invest in certain of our owned assets to increase their value, and in certain of the
hotels we operate under long-term leases, which we believe will result in higher Occupancy and Average Daily Rates
("ADR").

**_Occupancy, Average Daily Rate (ADR) and Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)_**

Revenue from our existing hotels is primarily affected by Occupancy and ADR. Both Occupancy and ADR are
strongly correlated to general economic conditions, the strength of the travel industry and the supply and demand of hotel
accommodation in a specific market. We believe that our brand positioning across a variety of our hotel segments, the
geographic distribution of our hotel portfolio and the different arrangements under which we operate our hotels allow us
to diversify risks related to specific hotels in our portfolio.

In order to react appropriately to developments in our local markets, we regularly monitor ADR, Occupancy and
RevPAR of our hotels. We believe that generally maintaining consistent pricing across hotel rooms in each category but
also taking into account regional economic conditions in our room rates has allowed us to gain market share and has
stabilized our RevPAR in the periods presented.

_RevPAR_

RevPAR is the product of the Average Daily Rate for a specified period multiplied by the Occupancy for that
period. RevPAR does not include non-room revenues, which consist of ancillary revenues generated by a hotel property,
such as food and beverage, renting out conference rooms for meetings, conventions and other events as well as telephone,
parking and other guest services. Our management uses RevPAR to identify trend information with respect to room
revenues of comparable properties and to evaluate hotel performance on a regional and segment basis. RevPAR is a
commonly used performance measure in the hotel industry.

We believe that a change in RevPAR is a reliable indicator of a change in revenue from our hotels because
RevPAR takes into account both ADR and Occupancy. However, RevPAR changes that are driven predominately by
changes in Occupancy have different implications for overall revenue levels and incremental profitability than do
changes that are driven predominately by changes in ADR. For example, assuming the same room rates and variable
operating costs, including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs, increases in Occupancy at a hotel
would lead to increases in room revenues compared to lower levels of Occupancy and such increased Occupancy may
also result in increased ancillary revenues, including food and beverage. In contrast, changes in ADR typically have a
greater effect on margins and profitability, because rates increase while variable operating costs remain relatively stable.

The following table sets forth the geographical breakdown of consolidated RevPAR for our hotels:

**For the year ended December 31,**

**For the three months ended**

**March 31,**

Group ........................................ **70.5** **4.2** **73.5** **(72.2)** **20.5** **44.6** **(79.0)** **9.4**

(1) Represents the percentage change in RevPAR between 2018 and 2019, between 2019 and 2020 or between the
three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, as applicable.

_Occupancy_

Occupancy is the quotient of the total number of Room Nights sold during a specified period divided by the total
number of hotel rooms available for each day during that period. Occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels'
available room capacity. Management uses Occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given
period, which is mainly driven by conferences, trade fairs and other events in the hotel's proximity. Occupancy is also
affected by the supply of hotel rooms in the area surrounding each of our hotels, and increases in hotel room supply,
which can increase competition and make it more difficult to achieve high Occupancy. Occupancy also helps us

109


-----

determine achievable ADR levels, based upon hotel category and hotel facilities, as demand for our hotel rooms increases
or decreases.

The following table sets forth the geographical breakdown of consolidated Occupancy for our hotels:

**For the year ended December 31,** **For the three months ended March 31,**

(1) Represents the percentage point difference in Occupancy between 2018 and 2019, between 2019 and 2020 or
between the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, as applicable.

_Average Daily Rate (ADR)_

Average Daily Rate is the quotient of total room revenues for a specified period divided by total Room Nights
sold during that period. ADR trends indicate how much customers are willing to pay for accommodation in a particular
region and a specific hotel. It also provides insights regarding the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of
hotels. ADR is a commonly used performance measure in the industry. We use ADR to assess the pricing levels that we
are able to generate by customer group, as changes in rates have a different effect on overall revenues and incremental
profitability than changes in Occupancy, as described above.

The following table sets forth the geographical breakdown of consolidated ADR for our hotels:

**For the year ended December 31,** **For the three months ended March 31,**

months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, as applicable.

**_Repositioning our brand and hotel portfolio and our refurbishment plan_**

We reorganized our hotels into three core brands to ensure that our marketing and service levels are consistent
across each brand. Each core brand has been tailored to represent a clearly defined level of service, quality and value for
our upper-upscale, upscale and mid-tier hotels. To aid the distinction among our brands and to maintain the position of
each of these brands, all aspects of all our brands, including design, technical services, graphics, promotions and training
have been carefully planned. In addition, we plan to carry out quality assurance inspections, including through in-person
reviews, on all our hotels to monitor quality and performance according to our predefined services and standards criteria.

As a result of the public tender offer and the integration of the Group into Minor Hotels in 2018 (an affiliate of
MINT), the parties have agreed to joint brand positioning for all markets and segments, on the basis of the reciprocal
master licensing agreement signed between the parties on February 7, 2019 by means of which each party licenses to the
other party the use of its corresponding commercial brands in the geographical areas where the other party operates.

The brands covered by the licensing agreement are Anantara, Avani, Oaks and Tivoli (in each case with MINT
as licensor) and NH Collection, NH Hotels and NHOW (in each case with the Group as licensor). In accordance with this
master licensing agreement, we currently operate six hotels in Europe under the luxury Anantara brand and 10 hotels
under the upper upscale Tivoli brand.

As of December 31, 2020, we have completed the execution of the approximately €371 million of investments

110


-----

(€320 million as of December 31, 2019) under our repositioning program since the plan was launched in 2014. As of
December 31, 2020, a total of 107 hotels have been refurbished, representing approximately 30% of our hotel portfolio.
These hotels were selected as we believe they are the most likely to yield higher Occupancy and ADR and to enhance the
value of our owned and long term leased assets. Out of the 11 hotels that are Mortgage Properties or properties that are
owned or leased by entities whose shares form part of the Share Collateral (excluding NH Italia), we have refurbished
five hotels. Regarding the assets which are owned or leased by NH Italia, 13 refurbishments have been completed and
eight more are in progress and we intend to refurbish additional hotels that are owned or leased by NH Italia.

Our refurbishment program involves modernizing rooms and common areas by refreshing paint and floor
coverings and replacing furnishings and finishings. In certain hotels, we have completed or intend to complete a
refurbishment of the entire building, including all mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems. The hotels we have
refurbished have generally experienced increased RevPAR.

In 2020, we opened 11 hotels: two management agreements (one NHOW in London and one Anantara in
Tunisia) and nine lease agreements (one NHOW in Amsterdam, one NH Collection in Verona and eight hotels under the
agreement reached with Covivio in Rome, Florence, Venice (two), Nice, Prague and Budapest (two) under Anantara, NH
Collection and NH brands) with a total of 1,966 rooms. In the first quarter of 2021, there have not been any new
openings.

In addition, we will continue to actively manage our asset portfolio. In the period from 2018 to 2020, there were
17 lease agreements that were not renewed. In 2020, we sold three hotels in Benelux (NH Gent Sint Pieters, NH Best and
NH Geldrop) for €14.8 million. In 2019, there were no relevant asset disposals while, in 2018, the sale and leaseback of
NH Collection Barbizon Palace in Amsterdam generated net cash inflow of €121.8 million and two leased contracts were
also restructured (one cancellation and one acquisition). We intend to continue implementing this strategy in the future.

We are strengthening our presence in strategic markets in Europe and Latin America by entering into new
management and lease agreements with variable components. As of March 31, 2021, we have entered into agreements to
operate 20 new hotels with 3,739 rooms (our "committed pipeline hotels"), which are expected to commence operations
mainly between 2021 and 2023. We will operate our committed pipeline hotels under lease and management agreements
with third-party hotel owners and most of our committed pipeline hotels will be operated under our NH Hotels and NH
Collection brands. We estimate that we will invest a total of approximately €30 million on our committed pipeline hotels
between 2021 and 2023.

**_Expenses_**

One of the largest components of our operating expenses is personnel expenses. Our personnel expenses
represented 26.2% of our net turnover in 2018 and 26.3% in 2019, while they represented 50.0% in 2020 and 88.9% in
the first three months of 2021 due to the lower revenues generated as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our
personnel expenses include salaries, training, development and other benefits. We seek to control our personnel expenses
by forecasting our temporary personnel needs based upon anticipated business volume, including Occupancy, and food
and beverage sales from restaurants, bars, conference facilities and in-room dining. We also seek to reduce personnel
expenses by outsourcing certain functions, such as housekeeping and janitorial services, to third party vendors, which are
recorded as other operating expenses.

A significant portion of our other operating expenses is rent expense, which is primarily determined by our
ability to negotiate favorable terms under our lease agreements and the general economic conditions in the region in
which the hotel is located. In addition, the variable portion of our rent expense is affected by the revenue level at our
leased hotels. In recent years, we have renegotiated directly with the lessor lease payments and other terms and
conditions in leases for certain of our hotels, primarily for hotels with negative EBITDA, which has reduced our
long-term costs. Since we cannot generally terminate or cancel our leases before their expiry, we enter into private
negotiations with the third-party owner on a case by case basis. We typically incur certain costs in connection with the
early termination or cancellation of our leases, which vary in each jurisdiction. In connection with the termination and
renegotiation of leases, we paid €9.4 million in 2018, we did not incur any cost in connection with the early termination
of leases in 2019 and we paid €2.1 million in 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we have not incurred any costs in
connection with the early termination of leases.

Other operating expenses include fees paid for professional and other services; commissions payable to third
parties; energy costs; repair and maintenance costs; laundry expenses; sales and distribution costs; advertising costs;
expenses related to information technology and telecommunication; allowances for contingency provisions; operational
taxes, including real estate and property taxes; and property insurance payments and are described further under "—
_Description of key line items—Other operating expenses"._

**_Acquisitions and disposals_**

We have acquired and disposed of assets, the proceeds of which have facilitated the repositioning of our
business and the repayment of debt and have also allowed us to make strategic investments, refurbish and upgrade our
existing hotels to enhance our revenue base and profitability and to increase the value of our owned assets. We intend to
continue replacing certain of the hotels we close by opportunistically opening hotels, including through leases and
management agreements, where we determine the financial return and strategic rationale are sound. We intend to
strengthen our presence in strategic markets by entering into management, franchise and variable lease agreement.
During this time, we expect our three core brands, NH Collection, NH Hotels and NHOW, to be fully developed and our
hotel portfolio to be stronger.

**_Cost savings initiative_**

Since 2013, we have been implementing a cost savings initiative to reduce our fixed costs. To date, we have
already consolidated our janitorial and maintenance services on a regional basis, rather than hotel by hotel and have
outsourced our janitorial services where it is more efficient to do so. This restructuring of our janitorial personnel makes
our cost structure more flexible by allowing us to increase or decrease our services in accordance with changes in
Occupancy levels. During 2014 and 2015, we also completed the centralization of our administrative staff in most of the
countries where we operate through the implementation of a shared services center with Accenture.

Since 2013, the cost saving initiative has been a key driver underlying the increase in our EBITDA. Once the
repositioning initiative, IT investment phase and revenue management strategy have been implemented, we intend to
improve efficiency of the Group by introducing a new operating model aimed at continuing to implement a further series
of cost savings initiatives to reduce our fixed costs, with the goal of increasing EBITDA going forward.

During 2017, we achieved savings from: (i) further efficiency improvements in our administrative functions as a
result of our shared services center with Accenture; (ii) better invoicing capabilities due to the migration of our back
office and front office systems to SAP and the use of other relevant IT tools; (iii) the integration of Commercial and
Revenue Management ("CRM"), enabling faster check in and check out; and (iv) optimization of CRM functions through
a revenue management software, the NH Gamechanger RMS (a 'white label' solution from Duetto Cloud) that
automatizes pricing and related capabilities and provides insights on pricing and demand. Additionally, we will continue
focusing on reducing sales commissions payable to third parties by implementing a global approach to accounts and
customers and developing an optimized channel mix which includes direct sales channels through our website and our
booking offices. Our channel mix will also include sales through online travel agencies ("OTAs"). OTAs provide us a
higher net ADR than other channels and allow us to gain access to long distance markets.

We have invested approximately €51 million since 2014 to overhaul our IT management systems across our
entire business, including centralizing our data collection, increasing automation of certain processes and developing a
new website, which we expect will further reduce our costs and positively affect our net turnover. The migration to SAP
will provide us with more efficient access to data across our business, enabling us to enhance the customer experience we
can offer and implement economies of scale which, we believe, will improve our competitiveness. We are also in the
process of implementing new M&E management tools in all our BUs, including: (i) the virtual planner, which allows our
teams and customers to virtually design meetings in 3D and enables them to anticipate the appearance of the selected
meeting room; (ii) the voice management tool, implemented at our Group Sales Offices to manage calls more efficiently;
and (iii) the M&E online store, which allows our customers to book M&E services online, freeing up time for our hotel
reservation agents. With our M&E management tools, we aim to improve our operational efficiency and productivity,
which we believe will lead to improved customer satisfaction and competitiveness.

The Group continues to be at the forefront of innovation. Our digital transformation has allowed processes and
systems to be made more efficient, improving basic processes, leading to further differentiation from competition. One of
our greatest achievements has been to centralize all our properties and functions into a single integrated system. This
allows us to have a fully-integrated digital platform: NH Digital Core Platform, which is a pioneering technological
solution in our sector that has allowed the integration of all our hotels' systems which has become the basis for the Group
to expand customer knowledge, maximize efficiency and innovate on a larger scale in all value areas.

Additionally, we have implemented a contingency plan to adapt operations and safeguard business continuity in
an environment where COVID-19 has created unprecedented challenges and uncertainties in the hotel industry such as, in
many cases, temporary closures which have been mandatory under local laws and regulations. See "The COVID-19
_pandemic and related measures" for more details._

**_Other operating expenses excluding rent_**

We are focusing on increasing the net ADR through an optimized channel mix. On the one hand, we are
working on reducing our brokering costs by trying to increase our direct sales channels and boosting the customer loyalty
through increased investments in marketing and IT. On the other hand, increased cooperation with online travel agencies
(OTAs), at the expense of other cheaper channels, provides a higher net ADR and allows us to gain access to long
distance markets. We have been working with primary global OTAs as we believe they may bring added value to our
chain as they invest in brand recognition, reduce the search cost for clients and give us access to markets where the NH
brand is not recognized by consumers. OTAs have become an important distribution channel also in connection with our
more mature markets, especially as younger generations' reliance on the internet tends to increase, enhancing NH brand
visibility. We are also cooperating with smaller OTAs specialized in niche markets or businesses (e.g. OTAs focused on
high-end clients) which we believe allows us to diversify our product with a lower cost. OTAs represent a flexible
channel that, in periods of need, we are able to promptly revise, for instance by offering promotions aligned with the
strategy followed in our direct channel. Between 2013 and 2018, we overhauled our IT management systems across our
entire business, including centralizing our data collection, increasing integration and automation of certain critical
processes, increasing our efficiency and developing new budget and planning systems, which we expect will further
reduce our costs in the long term. After the completion of our IT transformation plan, we began our digital evolution
roadmap in 2019 in order to increase our digitalization. Since 2019, we have launched various digital solutions to
improve the client experience, increase revenues and reduce costs, while improving efficiencies and sustainability. Some
examples are: "Fastpass", a tool which allows customers to check in online, choose their room and checkout online; a
guest mobile service which allows our customers to request any services needed during their stay through their mobile
device; tablets at reception which digitize the registration process at the front desk and facilitate GDPR compliance;
artificial intelligence at our central reservation office to assist us in responding to customer queries; robotics and
additional automations to gain efficiencies and also reduce paper printing; CRM tools for our commercial teams which
provide a 360 degree view of our clients, M&E management tools to improve revenue in quotations and to optimize the
processes; and added mobility for our employees (through housekeeping mobile, HUB for maintenance and tablets at
points of sale). We believe that our digitalization plan has allowed us to improve our business functionality and we will
continue to implement new initiatives to continue this trend.

**_Food and beverage sales_**

Food and beverage sales through restaurants, bars, conference facilities and in room dining in the hotels we
operate contribute significantly to our revenue. In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, food and
beverage revenue was, €325.0 million, or 20.1%, of our total net turnover, €340.6 million, or 19.9%, of our total net
turnover, and €111.2 million, or 20.7%, of our total net turnover, respectively. In the three months ended March 31, 2020
and 2021, food and beverage revenue was €57.1 million, or 20.6%, of our total net turnover, and €12.9 million, or 21.0%,
of our total net turnover, respectively. Historically, movements in our food and beverage sales have correlated with
movements in our room revenues, but our food and beverage sales have increased at a lower rate than our room revenues
and decreased at a higher rate than our room revenues, due to the severe restrictions put in place relating to COVID-19
and their impact on food and beverage services, we have had to adapt our service models, capacities and timetables in
order to comply with current legislation.

During 2014, we refined our adapted food and beverage offering in selected hotels to align menus and service
with our new brand architecture and experience and to further increase the profitability of our food and beverage offering
and the associated restaurants and other food service areas in our hotels. To this end, we sought to introduce a consistent
food and beverage experience for our meetings and events services, to explore the development of a distinctive bar
concept, and to revise our breakfast pricing at the BU level. We also implemented best practices from successful
refinements across a broader selection of hotels and made other select enhancements based on customer feedback. For
example, we introduced various new food options, such as vending machines, healthy, antioxidant options and 24-hour
room service in certain of our hotels.

During 2015, we developed our global food and beverage service operations by offering new concepts, such as
new items in our minibars, fresh corners, open bars and coffee breaks specifically tailored to our customers' preferences.
This has enabled us to improve our results from our food and beverage operations, having improved our revenue per
customer ratio in the main food and beverage services we provide (breakfast, minibar and restaurant) through a healthier
and more attractive offer. Moreover, we continue to optimize spaces through external collaborations or own
developments in order to maximize the productivity of our restaurants.

Since 2016, we have been continuously developing our global food and beverage service operations by tailoring
our services for each brand, for example, by offering gastronomic experiences for our NH Collection Brand. In addition,
we have sought to optimize the use of our space by collaborating with external restaurateurs, particularly in the Spain,
Benelux and Italy BUs.

113


-----

For our NH Collection brand, we have collaborated with gastronomic leaders, such as David Muñoz and Diego
Cabrera, to develop a cuisine that corresponds to that brand's values of excellence and service.

**_Seasonality and weather_**

Our business is seasonal in nature, and because the majority of our customers are typically business travelers we
generally experience higher Occupancy and net turnover from April through June and from September through October
when there are more business travelers in our primary markets compared to the rest of the year. In contrast, our
Occupancy is at its lowest, and we may incur a loss, during the first quarter of each year. In recent years, our first quarter
EBITDA only made a limited contribution to our full-year EBITDA due to generally low demand for hotel
accommodation following the holiday season in December and lower levels of demand by business travelers. Our first
quarter EBITDA is also negatively affected when Easter occurs in the first quarter of the year due to fewer business
travelers, though this is partially offset by an increase in leisure travelers. In the second, third and fourth quarters,
EBITDA generally makes greater contributions to our full-year EBITDA.

Our results are also affected by periods of abnormal, severe or unseasonal weather conditions, including natural
disasters such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and other adverse weather and climate conditions. Mild weather may
increase Occupancy levels in leisure destinations, particularly during peak travel season. Weather also typically affects
our energy costs, which increase when there is an abnormally severe or prolonged winter or summer.

**_Currency translation_**

We report our financial results in euro, but we make investments and engage in transactions in countries whose
currency is not the euro. Accordingly, a significant portion of our operations is conducted in functional currencies other
than the euro. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, approximately 6% of our net turnover was recorded in
currencies other than the euro, mainly U.S. dollars, Swiss francs, Argentine pesos, Mexican pesos, Colombian pesos,
Czech Koruna and Hungarian forint. As a result, we are required to translate those results from the functional currency
into Euro at the market based average exchange rates during the period reported. When comparing our results of
operations between periods, there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expenses that are derived
from fluctuations in exchange rates experienced between those periods. We manage our exposure to currency translation
risk by incurring indebtedness, if needed, in the same currency as certain of our investments. See "—Quantitative and
_qualitative disclosures about market risk—Foreign currency exchange risk"._

**_Repeat visitors and guest loyalty_**

As a chain brand with an international presence, we rely on repeat visits by our customers to sustain our
business model. We strive to attract repeat customers, particularly business customers, that will visit the same hotel on
multiple occasions. In addition, we aim to leverage our brand name and reputation for consistent quality across our
international locations to attract our existing customers to our other locations. Guest loyalty is an important factor
affecting our Occupancy. We have initiated various campaigns to promote awareness of our brands, and we have
developed new service concepts to improve guest satisfaction. We believe that these activities and concepts contribute to
our brand reputation and awareness, which are key factors in our ability to attract and retain guests. We monitor customer
satisfaction through our "Quality Focus On Line" tool, which analyzes results for both individual hotels and for our
Group in the aggregate. Loyalty programs are also an important tool in increasing guest loyalty. As of March 31, 2021,
our NH Rewards loyalty program counted more than 9.8 million members (9.7 million as of December 31, 2020). We are
in the process of migrating our loyalty program from NH Rewards to Global Hotel Alliance ("GHA"). GHA is preparing
to launch a redesigned version of its DISCOVERY program during the fourth quarter of 2021, which will include a
digital rewards currency and unique benefits and offers for local members. The migration to GHA will allow the
Company to benefit from a major global program with access to key feeder markets.

**_Perimeter changes_**

From time to time, we may acquire or dispose of hotels, enter into or terminate certain management and lease
agreements (especially underperforming agreements), refurbish our hotels, or change the type of contract under which we
operate our hotels (such as from an owned or leased hotel to a managed hotel). Such activities affect our perimeter and
results of operations. In addition, perimeter changes reduce the comparability of our financial results from one period to
the next. For example, in 2019, we acquired the Tivoli portfolio in Portugal, adding 2,452 hotel rooms to our portfolio
(adding three hotels operated under lease contract (20 years lease term) and 10 hotels operated under management
contract, which have an impact on our management fee, which is based on revenues and gross operating profit).
Additionally in 2020, the Group signed a long term sustainable lease contract with Covivio and acquired from Covivio
the operating companies that operate eight hotels with an investment of €50 million. These eight hotels, with a total of
1,966 rooms, are located in key European cities such as Budapest (two), Florence, Nice, Prague, Rome and Venice (two).

**Description of key line items**

**_Net turnover_**

Our net turnover includes hotel revenue from owned and leased hotels, fee revenue from our management
agreements, real estate revenues and other non-hotel revenue. Revenue from owned and leased hotels consists of room
sales and food and beverage sales through restaurants, bars, conference facilities and in-room dining. Additionally, we
obtain revenue from renting out conference rooms for meetings, conventions and other events as well as telephone,
parking and all other guest services. Fee revenue from our management agreements consists of base fees as a percentage
of total hotel revenue and incentive fees as a percentage of the gross operating profit or adjusted gross operating profit of
the hotels included in our management agreements. In addition, we may collect marketing fees for global marketing
efforts based upon total hotel room revenue, and, under some management agreements, we receive a technical assistance
fee for providing advice to the hotel owner regarding hotel construction.

**_Other operating income_**

Other operating income includes extraordinary income not allocable within our regular operations, including
operating subsidies, compensation paid to us in connection with termination of contracts, indemnities and the
capitalization of expenses related to work we have completed with respect to our own hotels.

**_Net gain (loss) on disposal of non-current assets_**

Net gain (loss) on disposal of non-current assets includes gains and losses from the disposal of assets, including
the disposal of owned hotels, and the early termination of lease agreements.

**_Procurements_**

Procurements consist of purchases and inventory impairments. Purchases include expenses for supplies acquired
from third parties for our operations. Purchases generally increase or decrease when our net turnover increases or
decreases. Inventory impairments includes variation on the valuation of our real estate inventories based upon expert
appraisal opinions.

**_Personnel expenses_**

Personnel expenses include wages, salaries and similar costs, social security contributions, termination or
redundancy costs, contributions to pension plans, similar costs and expenses and provisions made for similar costs and
expenses in the future. The allowances for termination or redundancy costs includes the amounts that can be reasonably
quantified and recognized as an expense in the year in which the decision to terminate the employment relationship is
taken.

**_Depreciation_**

Depreciation mainly includes the expense for the depreciation of our tangible fixed assets, consisting primarily
of our buildings, technical installations, machinery, fittings, furniture and equipment, the costs for which are distributed
over their estimated useful lives, in accordance with the following table:

**Estimated years**

**of useful life**

Buildings ............................................................................................................................................ 33-50

Plant and machinery ........................................................................................................................... 10-30

Other fixtures, tools and furniture ...................................................................................................... 5-10

Other fixed assets ............................................................................................................................... 4-5

Depreciation also includes the amortization of our right of use assets resulting from the application of IFRS 16.

**_Net losses from asset impairment_**

Net losses from asset impairment includes the difference between the estimated recoverable value and the book
value of our tangible, intangible and right of use fixed assets. Fixed assets are initially valued at their original cost and
such values are subsequently evaluated each year for any appropriate impairment losses. The recoverable amount is
either the net sale value or the value in use, whichever is higher. The value in use is calculated on the basis of estimated

115


-----

future cash flows discounted at an after tax discount rate that reflects the current market valuation with respect to the cost
of money and the specific risks associated with the asset.

**_Variation in the provision for onerous contracts_**

Onerous agreements are those agreements which we have determined the costs of fulfilling the obligations
thereunder exceed the economic benefits expected therefrom. We record a provision at the present value of future losses
under the agreement, or, if we decide to terminate the agreement, the amount payable in connection with the termination.
To the extent that such agreement is terminated, the corresponding provision is released. The pre-tax discount rates used
reflect the current market value of money, as well as the specific risks associated with these agreements.

With the application of IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019, the existing onerous provision was allocated to the right
of use line item.

**_Other operating expenses_**

Other operating expenses includes rent expense; fees paid for professional and other services; commissions
payable to third parties; outside labor; energy costs; repair and maintenance costs; laundry expenses; sales and
distribution costs; advertising costs; expenses related to information technology and telecommunication; allowances for
contingency provisions; operational taxes, including real estate and property taxes; and property insurance payments.

Fees paid for professional and other services are fixed and variable and include fees paid for yearly auditing
services; remuneration and expenses for directors, executive committee members and audit committee members; fees for
advisory services, including legal, tax, labor and food and beverage advisory services; and administrative, notary, trial
and litigation expenses. Commissions payable to third parties include amounts paid to third-party sales intermediaries,
such as Expedia, Trivago and Booking.com. Outside labor includes costs associated with outsourced housekeeping,
janitorial and other services. Energy costs are fixed and variable and include the cost of water, electricity, gas, oil and
energy service costs and installations. Repair and maintenance costs are fixed and variable and include all costs related to
replacing and repairing furniture, fixtures, textiles, walls, floors, finishings such as painting and fire safety materials and
costs incurred for maintenance contracts and external cleaning services such as window maintenance, waste disposal,
municipal cleaning services and vehicle maintenance. Under our leases, we are generally required to set aside a minimum
amount for maintenance capital expenditures on an annual basis. Laundry expenses relate to laundry services supplied by
third-party service providers. Sales and distribution costs include both a fixed and variable component and include
agency fees and costs in connection with public relations and communications services, including photography, graphics
production and merchandising and client gifts during promotional events. Advertising costs include all costs related to
marketing. Expenses related to information technology and telecommunication include both a fixed and variable
component and consist of expenses for software maintenance, including support and applications, hardware maintenance,
hardware renting, server maintenance, data communication lines and external IT and telecommunications support.
Allowances for contingency provisions include unrecovered receivables and litigation expenses. Operational taxes are
fixed and include local taxes on any owned real estate. Property insurance payments are fixed and include insurance
premiums paid for buildings and business interruption coverage and claims expenses.

**_Profit (loss) from entities valued through the equity method_**

Profit (loss) from entities valued through the equity method includes the results of companies included in our
consolidated results and over which we have significant influence but that we do not control jointly with a third party.
For the purposes of the preparation of our financial statements, significant influence is deemed to exist in investments in
which we, directly or indirectly, hold over 20% of the voting power, and in certain instances where our holding is less
than 20%, but significant influence can be clearly demonstrated. Companies in which our direct or indirect holding is
between 20% and 50%, but in which we do not hold majority voting rights or in which we do not have effective control
or joint control with another third-party entity, are consolidated using the equity method.

**_Financial income_**

Financial income primarily consists of interest income from cash deposits as well as interest income from loans,
evolution of discounted values and dividends. Evolution of discounted values represents the evolution of certain financial
assets, such as guarantee deposits for rent, which are recorded at present value in accordance with IFRS. As these
financial assets approach maturity, their present value increases.

116


-----

**_Change in fair value of financial instruments_**

Change in fair value of financial instruments includes the gains and losses derived from changes in the fair value
of financial instruments related to hedging arrangements.

**_Financial expenses_**

Financial expenses include interest incurred on our indebtedness, financial expenses for means of payment,
which includes commissions and costs for our point of sales transactions, and costs related to factoring and confirming
lines of credit entered into in the ordinary course of business.

**_Results from exposure to hyperinflation (IAS 29)_**

Results from exposure to hyperinflation (IAS 29) relate to the application of IAS 29 standard to the Group's
companies allocated in hyperinflationary economies. Results from exposure to hyperinflation (IAS 29) include gains or
losses derived from the effect of the hyperinflation on the net monetary position of the affected companies.

**_Net exchange rate differences_**

Net exchange rate differences include any gains or losses derived from exchange rate differences related to
assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the euro, which is our functional currency. Net exchange rate
differences mainly relate to transactions in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs, Argentine pesos, Mexican pesos and Colombian
pesos.

**_Gain (loss) of financial investments_**

Gain (loss) of financial investments includes the difference between the estimated recoverable value and the
book value of our financial investments. The recoverable amount is the market value of the investment. Gain (loss) of
financial investments also includes disposals of our financial assets and disposals of shares we own in our hotel operating
companies, except when such shares are sold in a leaseback arrangement, in which case the gain or loss resulting from
the sale is included in the gain (loss) on disposal of non-current assets line item.

year and Reserves of fully consolidated companies, amounting to €19.4 million (Results from exposure to
hyperinflation (IAS 29) €25.1 million and Corporation tax €(5.7) million); of which €16.2 million are assigned
to the Company and €3.2 million to non-controlling interests). This reclassification has no impact on total equity
and the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 were not restated. The financial
information presented herein is extracted from the comparative period presented in our consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019.

(2) Our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflect the application of
IFRS 16, which became effective on January 1, 2019. Our consolidated financial statements as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2018 were not restated for the application of IFRS 16. The main impact of the
application of IFRS 16 on the consolidated statement of profit and loss as of December 31, 2019 are an increase
in amortization of right of use assets of €181.1 million, an increase in financial expenses of €89.6 million and a
decrease in rent expenses of €257.3 million.

_Net turnover_

In the three months ended March 31, 2021, our net turnover was €61.2 million, a decrease of €215.8 million, or
77.9%, from €277.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the severe

-----

impact, since mid-March 2020, of the COVID-19 pandemic, which lead to a 31.9% decrease in ADR, a 32.0 percentage
point decrease in Occupancy.

_Other operating income_

In the three months ended March 31, 2021, other operating income was €1.0 million, a decrease of €3.4 million,
or 76.6%, from €4.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was mainly due to the
capitalization of expenses related to the internal refurbishment works performed for certain assets in 2020, which was
affected by the reduction of refurbishments performed by the Group during the three months ended March 31, 2021.

_Net gain (loss) on disposal of non-current assets_

In the three months ended March 31, 2021, our net gain on disposal of non-current assets was €2.9 million, an
increase of €3.0 million, compared to a loss of €0.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was
primarily due to the cancellation of lease contracts which under the IFRS 16 application had a positive effect due to the
cancellation of lease liabilities.

_Procurements_

In the three months ended March 31, 2021, procurements were €2.5 million, a decrease of €10.8 million, or
81.0%, from €13.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020. This was primarily due to the decrease of business
activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of the contingency plan to minimize the effect of the
COVID-19 pandemic on the business.

_Personnel expenses_

In the three months ended March 31, 2021, personnel expenses were €54.4 million, a decrease of €49.3 million,
or 47.5%, from €103.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020. This was primarily due to the decrease of
business activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of the contingency plan to minimize the
effect of the COVID-19 pandemic In addition, the Group received €8.8 million in subsidies from governments to offset
personnel expenses.

_Depreciation_

In the three months ended March 31, 2021, depreciation was €72.0 million, a decrease of €2.6 million, or 3.5%,
from €74.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the lower capital
expenditure investments.

_Net losses from asset impairment_

In the three months ended March 31, 2021, we recorded net losses from asset impairment of €2.3 million,
compared to net losses from asset impairment of €1.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020, due to an
impairment reversal.

_Variation in the provision for onerous contracts_

In the period of three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, there was not a significant result in this line.

_Other operating expenses_

In the three months ended March 31, 2021, other operating expenses were €48.2 million, a decrease of €79.6
million, or 62.3%, from €127.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020. This was primarily due to the
implementation of the contingency plan as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Profit (loss) from entities valued through the equity method_

In the period of three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, there was not a significant result in this line.

_Financial income_

In the three months ended March 31, 2021, financial income was €0.3 million, a decrease of €0.2 million from
€0.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to a global decrease in
the interest rates and a lower level of cash and cash equivalents.

_Change in fair value of financial instruments_

In the period of three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, there was not a significant result in this line.

_Financial expenses_

In the three months ended March 31, 2021, financial expenses were €32.4 million, a decrease of €0.3 million, or
0.9%, from €32.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily explained by higher
gross financial debt compared to the first quarter of 2020 (as a result of the drawdown of the Senior Secured RCF and the
COVID Related ICO Facilities) which was offset by lower financial expenses for payments to credit card issuers as a
consequence of the decrease in business activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Results from exposure to hyperinflation (IAS 29)_

In the period of three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, there was not a significant result in this line.

In the period of three months ended March 31, 2021 corporation tax was €15.4 million positive, an increase of
€3.3 million, from €12.1 million positive in the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily
attributable to negative earning before tax ("EBT") which lead to the activation of tax losses in Netherlands and Italy.

_Profit (loss)for the year from discontinued operations net of tax_

In the period of three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, there was not a significant result in this line.

_Profit (loss) for the financial year_

In the period of three months ended March 31, 2021 loss was €125.0 million negative, a decrease of €68.3
million, from €56.7 million negative in the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable
to the negative evolution of business due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

**_Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019_**

_Net turnover_

In the year ended December 31, 2020, our net turnover was €536.2 million, a decrease of €1,171.9 million, or
68.6%, from €1,708.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, mainly due to the significant impact, since midMarch 2020, of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused demand in the hotel sector to decrease significantly due to
lockdowns and travel restrictions.

_Other operating income_

In the year ended December 31, 2020, other operating income was €7.9 million, a decrease of €1.5 million, or
16.0%, from €9.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This was primarily due to a decrease of payroll
capitalizations, partially offset by an insurance compensation of €2.3 million linked to a fire incident.

_Net gain (loss) on disposal of non-current assets_

In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred a net loss of €0.5 million and €0.7 million,
respectively, on disposals of non-current assets.

_Procurements_

In the year ended December 31, 2020, procurements were €25.4 million, a decrease of €51.4 million, or 66.9%,
from €76.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This was primarily due to the decrease of business activity
because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of the contingency plan to minimize the effect of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

_Personnel expenses_

In the year ended December 31, 2020, personnel expenses were €268.2 million, a decrease of €180.6 million, or
40.2%, from €448.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This was primarily due to the implementation of the
contingency plan in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, consisting mainly of temporary layoffs (due to force majeure
or production reasons), and voluntary reductions in working days and wages, as well as reduced social security
contributions and expenses.

_Depreciation_

In the year ended December 31, 2020, depreciation was €302.5 million, an increase of €5.4 million, or 1.8%,
from €297.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is primarily due to the impact of the
repositioning investments in 2019 and by the perimeter changes.

_Net profits (losses) from asset impairment_

In the year ended December 31, 2020, net profits (losses) from asset impairment was a loss of €76.3 million
negative, an increase of €81.2 million, from a gain of €4.9 million positive in the year ended December 31, 2019. This
increase is primarily explained by the impairment registered as a result of a worsening of future cash flow expectations.

_Variation in the provision for onerous contracts_

In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was not a significant result in this line.

_Other operating expenses_

In the year ended December 31, 2020, other operating expenses were €249.5 million, a decrease of €374.7
million, or 60%, from €624.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This was primarily due to the
implementation of the contingency plan in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which included a significant reduction
in fixed and variable costs directly corresponding to the decrease in activity of the hotel business in 2020. This was
partially offset by the impact of perimeter changes.

_Gain (loss) from entities valued using the equity method_

In the year ended December 31, 2020, profit (loss) from entities valued using the equity method was a loss of
€7.5 million mainly due to the integration of the results of Sotocaribe, S.L., which had been previously classified as
available for sale. There was no significant result for this line in the result for the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Financial income_

In the year ended December 31, 2020, financial income was €1.7 million, a decrease of €2.5 million, or 59.5%,
from €4.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease is mainly due to a one-off €1.5 million dividend
received in 2019 from an investment sold in 2019, and reductions in interest income (corresponding to loans valued at
amortized cost) and other financial income.

_Change in fair value of financial instruments_

In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was not a significant result in this line.

121


-----

_Financial expenses_

In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was not a significant variation in this line, excluding
IFRS 16 impacts, the result in this line was €41.4 million and €45.9 million in financial expenses, respectively. In the
year ended December 31, 2020, there was a decrease of the financial expenses for means of payments of €12.8 million
compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of the decrease of the business activity caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic, which was offset by an increase of €8.1 million in interest expenses, mainly due to the full
drawdown of the Senior Secured RCF, the COVID Related ICO Facilities, other short-term bilateral credit lines and a
€4.5 million increase of lease interest under IFRS 16 due to the perimeter changes.

_Results from exposure to hyperinflation (IAS 29)_

In the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred a loss of €0.8 million from exposure to hyperinflation, which
includes the net effect recognized from the application of accounting standards to the financial statements of Argentine
subsidiaries. In the year ended December 31, 2019, there was not a significant result in this line.

_Net exchange rate differences_

In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was not a significant variation in this line.

_Gain (loss) of financial investments_

In the year ended December 31, 2020, Gain (loss) of financial investments was a gain of €6.7 million, an
increase of €16.7 million from a loss of €10.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase is mainly due
to the impairment of an investment, the committed investment and a loan related to Sotocaribe, S.L. amounting to €18.6
million expense partially offset by the gain of €8.5 million for the sale of the investment in Varallo Comercial, S.A. and
Adquisiciones e Inversiones Europeas, S.L recorded in the year ended December 31, 2019. The gain recognized in the
year ended December 31, 2020 is mainly due to the reversal of the impairment recorded on the investment in Sotocaribe,
S.L. (the impairment reversed is equal to the loss recorded in the entities valued through the equity method since this
investment was previously classified as available for sale).

_Corporation tax_

In the year ended December 31, 2020, Corporation tax was a gain of €75.2 million, an increase of €113.8
million compared to a €38.6 million expense in the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was mainly due to the
negative EBT, which leads to the activation of tax losses in Netherlands, Italy and Germany.

_Profit (loss)for the year from discontinued operations net of tax_

In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was not a significant result in this line.

_Profit (loss) for the financial year_

In the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred a loss of €440.4 million, a decrease of €533.3 million
compared to a profit of €92.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease reflects the negative impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.

**_Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018_**

_Net turnover_

In the year ended December 31, 2019, our net turnover was €1,708.1 million, an increase of €94.7 million, or
5.9%, from €1,613.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily the result of an increase of €73.1
million, or 6%, in room revenues driven by the 5.1% increase in ADR leading to an increase of 4.8% in RevPAR.

_Other operating income_

In the year ended December 31, 2019, other operating income was €9.4 million, an increase of €3.2 million, or
52.5%, from €6.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily due to the capitalization of expenses
related to refurbishments of our owned hotels.

-----

_Net gain (loss) on disposal of non-current assets_

In the year ended December 31, 2019, net gain (loss) on disposal of non-current assets was a loss of €0.7
million, a decrease of €86.7 million from a gain of €86.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This was
primarily due to the disposal of NH Collection Barbizon in 2018 (by way of sale and leaseback) with a capital gain
amounting to €87 million (before tax) from such disposal.

_Procurements_

In the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there was not a significant variation in this line, with
procurement costs of €76.8 million and €74.8 million, respectively.

_Personnel expenses_

In the year ended December 31, 2019, personnel expenses were €448.8 million, an increase of €26.1 million, or
6.2%, from €422.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, which was partially as a result of the increase in
collective labor agreements in Spain, Germany and Benelux and a larger workforce following certain perimeter changes
including the integration of the Tivoli acquisition.

_Depreciation_

In the year ended December 31, 2019, depreciation was €297.1 million, an increase of €180.8 million, or
155.5%, from €116.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was mainly due to the impact of accounting
changes introduced by the application of IFRS 16, which resulted in amortization expense for right-of-use assets (as
defined in IFRS 16) amounting to €181.1 million as of December 31, 2019).

_Net profits (losses) from asset impairment_

In the year ended December 31, 2019, net profits (losses) from asset impairment was a profit of €4.9 million, an
increase of €5.2 million, from a loss of €0.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This was mainly a result of the
impairment reversal due to the improvement in future cash flow expectations at certain hotels.

_Variation in the provision for onerous contracts_

In the year ended December 31, 2019, there is no income related to the variation in the provision for onerous
contracts as a consequence of the implementation of IFRS 16. With the application of IFRS 16 as of January 1, 2019, the
existing onerous provision was allocated to the right of use line item. In the year ended December 31, 2018, variation in
the provision for onerous contracts represented an increase of €4.3 million.

_Other operating expenses_

In the year ended December 31, 2019, other operating expenses were €624.2 million, a decrease of €233.1
million, or 27.2%, from €857.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This was mainly due to the accounting
changes introduced by the application of IFRS 16 (in total, we have €257.3 million of lease expenses, without recording
such leases as required by IFRS 16) partially offset by the expenses increase due to perimeter changes, including the
integration of the Tivoli brand. In 2019, the Group experienced a higher level of activity in its hotel business, which led
to an increase in some operational expenses directly related to the level of activity, such as the supplies and laundry
service, among others. Also, the increase recorded in RevPAR resulted in an increase in associated agency commission
expenses. However, savings were achieved in other items such as marketing and merchandising, among others.

_Profit (Loss) from entities valued through the equity method_

In the year ended December 31, 2019, profit (Loss) from entities valued through the equity method had no
impact on our result while resulting in a loss of €0.5 million in the previous year.

_Financial income_

In the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, financial income was €4.2 million and €6.0 million,
respectively, representing a year-on-year decrease of €1.8 million, or 30.4%. This was a result of an increase in dividend
and interest income partially offsetting a decrease in other financial income.

123


-----

_Change in fair value of financial instruments_

In the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there was not a significant result in this line.

_Financial expenses_

In the year ended December 31, 2019, financial expenses were €135.5 million, an increase of €75.5 million, or
125.8%, from €60.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to the accounting
changes introduced by the application of IFRS 16 (resulting in an increase of €89.6 million in interest expenses on leases)
partially offset by a €10.8 million interest savings, mainly explained by the early redemption of the convertible bond in
June 2018 and by the early repayment of a portion of the 2019 Notes in the fourth quarter of 2018.

_Results from exposure to hyperinflation (IAS 29)_

In the year ended December 31, 2019, exposure to hyperinflation had a negligible impact on our results, while
resulting in a loss of €0.6 million the previous year (which reflected the net effect recognized from the application of IAS
29 to the financial statements of Argentine subsidiaries from the date of first application at December 31, 2019.

_Net exchange rate differences_

In the year ended December 31, 2019, net exchange rate differences reflected an expense of €2.3 million, a
decrease of €3.4 million from income of €1.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was mainly
due to exchange rates fluctuations in Latin America.

_Gain (loss) of financial investments_

In the year ended December 31, 2019, Gain (loss) of financial investments was a loss of €10.0 million, a
decrease of €9.6 million, from a loss of €0.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is mainly due to
the impairment of an investment, the committed investment and a loan related to Sotocaribe, S.L. amounting to €18.6
million expense partially offset by the gain of €8.5 million for the sale of the investment in Varallo Comercial, S.A. and
Adquisiciones e Inversiones Europeas, S.L.

_Corporation tax_

In the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred a Corporation tax expense of €38.6 million, a decrease of
€41.1 million, or 51.6%, from an expense of €79.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was
mainly due to the tax effect of the disposal by sale-and-leaseback of NH Collection Barbizon in 2018 amounting to a
€32.0 million improvement and the accounting changes introduced by the application of IFRS 16 (decrease of €4.4
million in Corporation tax).

_Profit (loss) for the year from discontinued operations net of tax_

In the year ended December 31, 2019, there was not a significant result in this line, while in the year ended
December 31, 2018, we incurred a loss of €0.6 million, mainly due to the discontinued operations of Sotocaribe, S.L.

_Profit (loss) for the financial year_

In the year ended December 31, 2019, profit for the year was €92.9 million, a decrease of €12.2 million, or
11.6%, from a profit of €105.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was mainly due to the
disposal of NH Collection Barbizon in 2018 (for consideration of €55 million net of taxes), the accounting changes
introduced by the application of IFRS 16 and the increase in personal expenses aforementioned, partially offset by the
increase in profitability of the business (increase of 4.8% in RevPAR through 5.1% increase in ADR).

**Liquidity**

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and cash proceeds and drawings available from
our financing activities. Our ongoing asset rotation strategy through sale and leasebacks provide additional liquidity.
After giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, as of March 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents would have been
€365 million, with available undrawn amount of €31 million, which is comprised of €25 million from bilateral credit
lines and €6 million from the Senior Secured RCF.

124


-----

Cash flows from our financing activities include, among others, borrowings under our credit facilities, including
the Senior Secured RCF. Our liquidity requirements arise primarily from our capital expenditures and our need to meet
debt service requirements and to fund. Our cash flows generated from operating activities together with our cash flows
generated from financing activities have historically been sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements.

Due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken several pro-active steps to mitigate its impact on our
financial position and to strengthen our liquidity. This includes drawing €250 million under the Senior Secured RCF in
March 2020. We have since limited repayments of the Senior Secured RCF to €14 million, leaving €236 million drawn as
of March 31, 2021. We also drew €39 million under unsecured short-term bilateral credit facilities through 2020. On
April 29, 2020, we entered into a €225 million Term Facility Agreement, which was fully drawn as of March 31, 2021.
Our obligations under the Term Facility Agreement are 70% guaranteed by the Instituto de Crédito Oficial (the "ICO") in
Spain under the guarantee facility program for businesses and self-employed persons to mitigate the economic effects of
COVID-19, which was approved pursuant to the Spanish Royal Decree-law 8/2020 of March 18, 2020, on extraordinary
measures to deal with the economic and social impact of the pandemic caused by COVID-19 (the "ICO Guarantees"). On
May 18, 2020, we also entered into a €25 million Sabadell Bilateral Facility Agreement, which is also guaranteed by an
ICO Guarantee (the "Sabadell Bilateral Facility Agreement" and, together with the Term Facility Agreement, the "
COVID Related ICO Facilities"). To further mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in May 2021, we obtained
a waiver of financial covenant testing under the COVID Related ICO Facilities until June 30, 2022 (inclusive) so their
compliance will not be verified until December 31, 2022, as well as an extension of the maturity from 2023 to 2026.
Additionally, we obtained a waiver of the financial covenants set forth in the Senior Secured RCF Agreement up to and
including December 31, 2021, as well as a significant reduction to the levels required to be met up to and including June
30, 2022 (returning these ratios to their original levels as of December 31, 2022). In connection with the Offering, the
lenders under the Senior Secured RCF have also agreed to a waiver of the financial covenants for the full year of 2022.
The effectiveness of this waiver is conditional upon the closing of the Offering on the Issue Date. See "Business–Our
_strengths–_ _Proactive strengthening of our capital structure and liquidity position" and "Description of certain financing_
_arrangements."_

The liquidity of the Group has been additionally reinforced during the year with new bilateral loans, taking
advantage of the different governmental support and guarantee programs, as follows:

    - a two-year loan of €10.0 million was signed with Caixabank in May 2020, and guaranteed by an ICO
Guarantee. In May 2021, this loan was amended and extended for three additional years, maturing in
May 2025;

    - a three-year loan of €7.5 million was signed with Abanca in July 2020, and guaranteed by an ICO
Guarantee. In April 2021, this loan was amended and extended for three additional years, maturing in
July 2026;

    - a six-year loan of €15.0 million was signed with Banco Banca Popolare di Milano in October 2020, and
guaranteed by the Italian government (SACE guarantee); and

    - several additional bilateral loans amounting to €6.6 million were signed in other regions, of which €4.1
million are also guaranteed by local governments.

All these new bilateral loans reinforce the liquidity position of the Company.

(1) Our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflect the application of IFRS 16,
which became effective on January 1, 2019. Our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31,
2018 were not restated for the application of IFRS 16. The main impact of the application of IFRS 16 on the
consolidated statement of cash flow as of December 31, 2019 are an increase in adjusted result in €252.3 million
and a decrease in net cash flow from financing activities in €252.3 million.

(2) Represents pre-tax profit (loss) from continuing operations attributable to shareholders of the Issuer and to
non-controlling interests.

**_Cash flows from operating activities_**

_Three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to three months ended March 31, 2020_

Net cash flow from operating activities decreased by €34.1 million to €14.0 million negative for the three
months ended March 31, 2021 from €20.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was
primarily attributable to a decrease of the adjusted result by €87.8 million to €52.1 million negative for the three months
ended March 31, 2021 from €35.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and an increase of net change in
assets/liabilities by €40.7 million to €30.2 million positive for the three months ended March 31, 2021 from €10.5 million
negative for the three months ended March 31, 2020. In addition, tax on profits paid increased by €13.0 million to €7.9
million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from €5.1 million negative for the three months ended March 31,
2020.

Adjusted result decreased by €87.8 million to €52.1 million negative for the three months ended March 31, 2021
from €35.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower
consolidated profit (loss) before tax due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Net change in assets/liabilities increased by €40.7 million to €30.2 million positive for the three months ended
March 31, 2021 from €10.5 million negative for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily
attributable to a decrease of €43.6 million in trade creditors accounts in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first
quarter of 2020, as a consequence of reduced activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic and an improvement in supply
change management. In addition, other current liabilities decreased by €19.7 million in the first quarter of 2021 as
compared to the first quarter of 2020. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower level of business activity as
compared to March 2020 which had higher cash movements of payable VAT and withholding taxes. This decrease was
partially offset by a decrease of €25.4 million in trade and other receivables accounts in the first quarter of 2021 as
compared to the first quarter of 2020 mainly due to an improvement in the collection of receivables.

-----

_Year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to year ended December 31, 2019_

Net cash flow from operating activities decreased by €599.4 million from a €505.3 million inflow for the year
ended December 31, 2019 to a €94.1 million outflow for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was mainly due to a
consolidated loss before tax and discontinued operation of €515.5 million in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
compared to a consolidated profit before tax and discontinued operations of €131.4 million in 2019.

Net variation in assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease of €43.5 million in 2020, compared to a decrease of
€68.3 million in 2019. This was mainly due to reduced advance payments from customers due to lower activity and
refunds of certain prepayments and overflow of supplier's invoices from the last months of 2019.

Additionally, tax on profit paid increased €63.8 million from a €56.0 million expense for the year ended
December 31, 2019 to a €7.8 million income for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was mainly due to the lower
EBT performance.

_Year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to year ended December 31, 2018_

Net cash flow from operating activities increased by €253.1 million from €252.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to €505.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was mainly due to the
implementation of IFRS 16 which changed the recognition and registration of fixed lease payments (fixed lease payments
are now recorded as debt repayment as defined in IFRS 16).

In addition, net variation in assets and liabilities decreased €36.3 million from €23.9 million positive to €12.3
million negative mainly due to (i) stabilized average collection period after optimization achieved in previous years and a
significant increase in the activity (€28.8 million), (ii) regularization on supply chain process during 2019 reducing
average payments terms (€5.0 million) and (iii) the legal provisions and severance payments paid in 2020 (€16.3
million), these effects are partially offset by the variation in other current assets (€10.0 million) mainly explained by the
indemnity paid to the NH Zurich owner for the early termination of the lease agreement.

In addition, tax on income paid decreased €5.6 million from a €61.6 million expense to a €56.0 million expense
mainly due to the payments of corporation tax corresponding to the asset disposals in the year ended December 31, 2018
(the corporate income tax ("CIT") on the sale and leaseback of NH Collection Barbizon Palace was €32.4 million
negative) partially offset by the payment corresponding with the final settlement of the CIT 2018 in Italy amounting to
€10 million (payment made in 2019) and by the higher CIT paid in 2019, mainly in Italy and Spain, due to the stronger
business performance amounting to €16.8 million.

**_Cash flows from (used in) investing activities_**

_Three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to three months ended March 31, 2020_

Net cash flow from (used in) investing activities increased by €11.9 million to €14.7 million of cash flow used
for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to €26.7 million of cash flow used for the three months ended
March 31, 2020. The cash flow obtained from disposals by the Group decreased by €17.2 million from €17.3 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, mainly explained by
the disposal of a minority stake in the first quarter of 2020. Regarding investing activities, the cash used decreased by
€29.1 million, from €44.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €14.9 million for the three months ended
March, 2021. This decrease is mainly explained by the loan cancellation of a minority stake in a plot of land in the
Mexican Caribbean (€5.7 million negative) and related taxes (€4.2 million negative) in 2020 and the decrease of the
repositioning investment payments in 2021.

_Year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to year ended December 31, 2019_

Net cash flow from (used in) investing activities increased by €28.3 million to an outflow of €137.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to €166.0 million outflow for the year ended December 31, 2019. This was
mainly due to the disposal of a minority stake (contributing €17.3 million) and three hotels in Benelux (contributing an
aggregate of €14.8 million), the integration of eight hotels previously operated by the Boscolo Collection (costing €51.2
million), the cancellation of a loan on a minority stake in a plot of land in the Mexican Caribbean (costing €5.7 million)
and related taxes (costing €4.2 million) and an investment in a managed hotel in London (costing €2.9 million) partially
offset by the less capital expenditure in the year ended December 31, 2020.

-----

_Year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to year ended December 31, 2018_

Net cash flow from (used in) investing activities decreased by €233.7 million to a €166.0 million outflow for the
year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a €67.7 million inflow for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was
primarily attributable to a decrease of inflow from disposals by €177.1 million from €202.5 million to €25.4 million
mainly due to the sale of NH Collection Amsterdam Barbizon in 2018 which provided a cash inflow of €154.1 million.
Additionally, investment outflows increased by €56.8 million to €192.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019
from €135.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was mainly due to the investments made as part of our
repositioning program, particularly the refurbishment works of the NH Collection Flower Market, NH Conference Centre
Leeuwenhorst, NH Vienna Airport, NH Palermo, NH Ambassador, NH Luz de Huelva, NH Hamburg Altona and NH
New York Jolly Madison Towers.

**_Cash flows from (used in) financing activities_**

_Three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to three months ended March 31, 2020_

Net cash flow from (used in) financing activities decreased by €262.0 million to €56.1 million negative for the
three months ended March 31, 2021 from €205.9 million positive for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This
decrease was primarily attributable to the drawdown of €250 million under the Senior Secured RCF on March 26, 2020
(of which €236 million remained drawn as of March 31, 2021) and the drawdown of other credit lines.

_Year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to year ended December 31, 2019_

Net cash flow from (used in) in financing activities increased by €582.0 million to a €262.2 million inflow for
the year ended December 31, 2020 from a €319.8 million outflow for the year ended December 31, 2019. This was
mainly due to the drawdown of the €225 million Term Facility Agreement on April 29, 2020, the €25 million Sabadell
Bilateral Facility Agreement on May 27, 2020, the €10 million new term loan (with Caixabank) on May 6, 2020, the
€250 million Senior Secured RCF on March 26, 2020, with a partial repayment of €14 million on December 1, 2020, and
the drawdown of other credits lines, partially offset by the decrease in dividends paid out.

_Year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to year ended December 31, 2018_

Net cash flow from (used in) financing activities decreased by €185.3 million to a €319.8 million outflow for the
year ended December 31, 2019 from a €134.5 million outflow for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was mainly
due to the increase in the liability instruments for the application of IFRS 16 amounting to €252.3 million (fixed lease
payments are recorded as debt repayment as defined in IFRS 16) and the higher dividend paid in 2019 partially offset by
(i) the debt increase regarding the available portion of the New York Capex Term Facility, (ii) the decrease in the interest
paid for debts due to debt interest savings, explained by the early redemption of a convertible bond in June 2018 and (iii)
the partial early repayment of the Notes and the lower debts repayments made in 2019.

**Capital expenditures**

Our capital expenditures consist primarily of expenditures towards maintenance of our hotel facilities, the
opening of new hotels and information technology. Maintenance capital expenditures include repairs, ordinary course
maintenance expenses and expenditures necessary to comply with legal requirements, such as occupational, health and
safety standards. The following table sets forth our capital expenditures for the periods indicated as derived from our cash
flow statement.

**Capital expenditures .......................................................................................... 133.7** **190.8** **105.5** **34.0** **14.9**

For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, investments in property, plant and equipment were
mainly related to hotel refurbishment and recent openings such as the refurbishment of the NH Collection Madrid
Abascal in Spain, the renovations of the NH Trieste in Italy; the opening of the NH Hannover in Central Europe;
refurbishment of the NHOW Brussels Bloom hotel in Benelux and the refurbishment of the NH Collection New York

128


-----

Madison Avenue, in New York.

In 2018, 2019 and 2020, investments in property, plant and equipment mainly related to our brand development
initiative, refurbishment program, the maintenance of our hotel facilities and investments in intangible assets mainly
related to investments for the overhaul of our IT management systems and the upgrade of our software applications.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, we invested approximately €371 million as part of our repositioning
initiative launched in 2014. A total of 107 hotels were refurbished, representing approximately 30% of our hotel
portfolio. These hotels have been selected as we believe they are the most likely to yield higher Occupancy and ADR and
to enhance the value of our owned and long term leased assets. Out of the 11 hotels that are Mortgage Properties or
properties that are owned or leased by entities whose shares form part of the Share Collateral (excluding NH Italia), we
have refurbished five hotels. Regarding the assets which are owned or leased by NH Italia, 13 refurbishments have been
completed and eight more are in progress and we intend to refurbish additional hotels that are owned or leased by NH
Italia. Our refurbishment program involves modernizing rooms and common areas by refreshing paint and floor
coverings and replacing furnishings and finishings. In certain hotels, we intend to complete a refurbishment of the entire
building, including all mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems. Although we have embarked on a capital-intensive
refurbishment program, we have staggered the costs over several years, and we are therefore able to substantially control
or reduce such costs by restructuring the program as needed.

While we implement our brand development initiative and repositioning, we expect that our maintenance capital
expenditures as a percentage of net turnover will decrease. Between 2013 and 2018, we overhauled our IT management
systems across our entire business, including centralizing our data collection, increasing integration and automation of
certain critical processes, increasing our efficiency and developing new budget and planning systems, which we expect
will further reduce our costs in the long term. After the completion of our IT transformation plan, we began our digital
evolution roadmap in 2019 in order to increase our digitalization. Since 2019, we have launched various digital solutions
to improve the client experience, increase revenues and reduce costs, while improving efficiencies and sustainability. We
invested approximately €14.5 million in 2019 and €8.3 million in 2020 and we plan to continue investing in order to
further increase our digitalization in the coming years.

As of March 31, 2021, we were contractually committed to invest €21.4 million in the opening of our committed
pipeline hotels in 2021 and 2022.

We expect to finance our capital expenditures mainly from the cash generated by our operating and financing
activities.

Our working capital requirements largely arise from the timing of receipt of our trade and other receivables,
which primarily consist of amounts owed to us by our customers; inventories primarily include catering products sold
through our hotel operations; and other current assets composed of prepaid expenses. Our liabilities to our trade creditors
include accounts payable arising from our regular trading activities, and advance payments from customers, which
includes customer deposits arising from our hotel. Our other current liabilities include accrued wages and salaries, other
current debts and taxes.

We have historically funded our working capital requirements through funds generated from our operations,
through funds generated from indebtedness and through funds from other finance resources. Our working capital

129


-----

typically is greatest during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year due to higher Occupancy, RevPAR and ADR,
and is lowest during the first quarter of our fiscal year due to lower Occupancy in our hotels.

Our working capital decreased by €29.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to an
increase of €11.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020. This was mainly due to a decrease of €43.6 million
in trade creditors accounts in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020, as a consequence of
reduced activity due to COVID-19 pandemic and an improvement in supply change management. In addition, other
current liabilities decreased by €19.7 million in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020. This
decrease was primarily attributable to lower levels of business activity compared to March 2020 which had higher cash
movements of payable VAT and withholding taxes. This decrease was partially offset by a decrease of €25.4 million in
trade and other receivables accounts in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020 due to an
improvement in collection of receivables.

Our working capital increased by €56.6 million in 2020 compared to an increase of €13.5 million in 2019,
mainly explained by reduced advance payments form customers due to lower activity, refunds of prepayments and
overflow of supplier's invoices from the last months of 2019.

Our working capital increased by €13.5 million in 2019 compared to a decrease of €33.8 million in 2018, mainly
due to the (i) stabilized average collection period after optimization achieved in previous years and a significant increase
in activity (€28.8 million) (ii) regularization on supply chain processes during 2019, reducing average payment terms
(€5.0 million) and (iii) legal provisions and severance payments paid in 2020 (€16.3 million). These effects were partially
offset by the variation in other current assets (€10.0 million) mainly explained by the indemnity paid to the NH Zurich
owner for the early termination of the lease agreement.

**Capital resources**

Our main sources of financing following the Refinancing will be the Notes, the Senior Secured RCF, the
COVID Related ICO Facilities and various lines of credit. We currently have and, after the issuance of the Notes, will
continue to have a significant amount of outstanding debt with substantial debt service requirements. As of March 31,
2021, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions as described under "Use of proceeds", the aggregate amount of our
outstanding debt would have been €1,051 million (excluding operating lease liabilities and the Shareholder Loan).

In October 2020, the lenders under the COVID Related ICO Facilities and lenders under the Senior Secured
RCF granted a financial covenants waiver with respect to December 2020 and June 2021. In May 2021, the lenders under
these facilities granted certain extensions to the financial covenants waiver. In addition, the relevant lenders have agreed
an extension of the term of the COVID Related ICO Facilities, from April 29, 2023 to April 29, 2026. See "Recent
_Developments Financial Covenant Waivers and Extensions of Maturity of Certain Credit Facilities" and "Risk factors—_
_Risks relating to our business and industry—We may not meet certain financial ratios and levels imposed on us by the_
_Senior Secured RCF or the COVID Related ICO Facilities"._

**_Senior Secured RCF_**

On September 22, 2016, the Issuer entered into the Senior Secured RCF. The Senior Secured RCF is secured by
the same Collateral as the Notes on a pari passu basis, as described under "Description of certain financing
_arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement". For a description of the Senior Secured RCF, see "Description of certain_
_financing arrangements—Senior Secured RCF Agreement"._

**_Term Facility Agreement_**

On April 29, 2020, the Issuer entered into the Term Facility Agreement. This facility is unsecured. For a
description of this agreement see "Description of certain financing arrangements—Term Facility Agreement and
_Sabadell Bilateral Facility Agreement "._

**_Off-balance sheet arrangements_**

We do not currently have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements.

_Operating lease agreements_

Contractual obligations under operating lease agreements are no longer off-balance sheet arrangements, as they
have been included on our financial statements from January 1, 2019 due to the application of IFRS 16.

**Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk**

Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency
exchange risk, liquidity risk and market risks. Our risk management policy, which is managed centrally by our senior
management, focuses on minimizing the potential adverse effects on our financial performance. The following section
discusses the significant financial risks to which we are exposed. This discussion does not address other risks that we are
exposed to in the normal course of business, such as operational risks. See "Risk factors".

**_Credit risk_**

We have adopted risk management procedures to both reduce and monitor credit risk. Our main financial assets
include cash and cash equivalents, as well as trade and other accounts receivables. We have no significant concentration
of third-party credit risk due to the diversification of our financial investments, as well as to the distribution of trade risks
with short collection periods among a large number of customers. Part of our trade and other accounts receivable are
guaranteed through guarantees, sureties and advance payments by tour operators.

131


-----

We evaluate our bad debt provision on a regular basis for each debtor. We record a provision for any trade and
other accounts receivable overdue more than 180 days. The outstanding provision of non-recoverable bad debt was
€8.4 million as of March 31, 2021 compared to €9.0 million as of December 31, 2020, €5.1 million as of December 31,
2019, and €6.5 million as of December 31, 2018.

Credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents arises from the risk that the counterparty becomes insolvent and
accordingly is unable to return the deposited funds as a result of the insolvency. To mitigate this risk, we seek to transact
and deposit funds with financial institutions we deem credit worthy, and we monitor transaction volumes in order to
reduce the risk of concentration of our transactions with any single party.

**_Interest rate risk_**

We have, and after the Refinancing will continue to have, a substantial amount of floating rate borrowings, and
thus we are exposed to risks related to fluctuations in the levels of interest rates. After giving pro forma effect to the
Transactions, approximately 62% of our total gross borrowings as of March 31, 2021 would have been floating rate debt.
We estimate that an increase in interest rates of 25 basis points, or 0.25%, on our floating rate debt as of March 31, 2021,
as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the Transactions, would result in an increase in finance expense of approximately
€1.8 million. As of March 31, 2021, we have two interest rate swaps on the mortgages of our Wilan Ander and Wilan
Huel hotels.

**_Foreign currency exchange risk_**

We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations that may affect our sales, results, equity and cash flows. This
exposure mainly arises from investment in foreign countries and transactions by Group companies operating in countries
whose currency is not the euro, including Argentina, Chile, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Mexico,
Switzerland and the United States. To mitigate these risks, we seek to align the composition of our financial debt with
cash flows in the different countries in which we operate.

In this sense, we have local debt facilities denominated in currencies other than the euro. In Chile, we have a
secured loan denominated in Chilean Peso; the outstanding balance of this loan as of March 31, 2021 was equivalent to
€16.5 million. In Chile, we have also an unsecured loan denominated in Chilean Peso, which has an outstanding balance
as of March 31, 2021 of €1.0 million. In Colombia, we have unsecured debt facilities denominated in Colombian Pesos;
the outstanding balance on these loans as of March 31, 2021 was equivalent to €1.7 million. In Argentina, we have an
unsecured loan denominated in Argentinian Pesos; the outstanding balance of this loan as of March 31, 2021 was
equivalent to €1.3 million. In the United States, we have unsecured loans denominated in USD; the outstanding balance
on these loans as of March 31, 2021 was equivalent to €42.9 million.

**_Liquidity & Refinancing risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to fulfil present or future obligations if we do not have sufficient funds
available to meet such obligations. Liquidity risk arises mostly in relation to cash flows generated and used in financing
activities, and particularly by servicing our debt, in terms of both interest and capital, and our payment obligations
relating to our ordinary business activities. We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity include:

    - a reduction in operating cash flows due to a lowering of net income from our operations, which could
be due to downturns in our performance or the industry as a whole;

    - adverse working capital developments;

    - exposure to increased interest rates in relation to our borrowings that bear interest at a variable rate; and

    - higher capital expenditures, including in connection with our repositioning initiative.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as
they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

    - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

    - reduce or delay our planned acquisitions;

    - sell assets;

132


-----

    - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

    - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, the Senior Secured RCF and
the COVID Related ICO Facilities on or before maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes, the Senior Secured RCF and the
COVID Related ICO Facilities, limit our ability to pursue these alternatives, as may the terms of any future debt.

We manage liquidity risk by monitoring the maturity schedule of our financial debt, as well as managing and
maintaining credit lines to allow any forecast cash needs to be met. Although we believe that our expected cash flows
from operations, together with available borrowings, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service
needs, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future debt and
equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due ("Refinancing
Risk"), including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We anticipate that our high leverage will continue for
the foreseeable future. Our high level of debt may have important negative consequences for you. For more information,
see "Risk factors—Risks relating to the Notes and our structure—Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations
_could adversely affect our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Notes_
_Guarantees". See also "Description of certain financing arrangements" and "Description of the Notes"._

**Critical accounting estimates**

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that management apply accounting standards
and methods which, under certain circumstances, are based upon difficult subjective measurements and estimates based
upon past experience and on assumptions considered, at various times, to be reasonable and realistic in terms of the
respective circumstances. The use of such estimates and assumptions affects the amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the interim unaudited
financial statements, as well as other financial information disclosed therein. Actual results for those areas requiring
management judgment or estimates may differ from those recorded in the financial statements due to the occurrence of
events and the uncertainties which characterize the assumptions and conditions on which the estimates are based.

The primary areas applicable to our Group that require greater subjectivity of management in making estimates
and where a change in the conditions underlying the assumptions could have a significant impact on our consolidated
financial statements include:

**_Asset impairment_**

Non-current assets (including right of use arising from the application of IFRS 16) are annually, or whenever
there are indicators of a loss of value, tested for impairment, and whenever there are indicators of difficulty in recovery
an impairment loss is recorded. The annual test of impairment is performed at the end of each fiscal year, not at half year
closing. The existence of such indicators can be verified through subjective valuations, based upon information available
within the Group or externally and based upon historical experience. Moreover, in the presence of a potential
impairment, this is determined with appropriate valuation techniques. The correct identification of the factors, indicating
a potential impairment and the estimates to determine the loss, may depend on conditions which vary over time, affecting
the assessments and estimates. Similar considerations regarding the existence of indicators and the use of estimates in the
application of valuation techniques can be found in the valuations to be made in the event of the reversal of impairment
losses charged in previous periods.

**_Useful life of tangible and intangible assets_**

The cost of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is depreciated or amortized on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. The economic useful life of the asset is determined at the time of
purchase, based upon historical experience for similar assets, market conditions and expected future events which may
affect them, such as technological changes. The effective economic useful life may, therefore, be different from the
estimated useful life. Each year developments in technology and the business, any contractual and legislative changes
related to the utilization of the assets and their recoverable value are reviewed to update the residual useful life. Such
updating may modify the period of depreciation and consequently the annual rate and charge for the current and future
periods.

133


-----

**_Goodwill_**

Goodwill is, annually or whenever there are indicators of a loss of value, tested for impairment, and any
impairment losses arising as a result of the impairment test are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.
Generally, the impairment test is performed at the end of the year, but if there are any indicators of loss of value an
impairment test is performed before the end of the year. The impairment test involves allocating goodwill to "cash
generating units" ("CGU") and the determination of the relative fair value. Our primary CGUs relate to hotels. When the
fair value is lower than the carrying amount of the CGU, an impairment loss is recognized on the goodwill allocated to
the CGU. The allocation of goodwill to a CGU and the determination of fair value require assumptions and estimates
based upon factors which may change over time, with consequent effects, which may be significant, on the assessments.

**_Asset valuation_**

We evaluate, annually or whenever there are indicators of a loss of value, possible losses of asset value, which
would require us to reduce the book value of our tangible and intangible assets. A loss is deemed to occur when the
recoverable value of an asset is less than its book value. The recoverable amount is either the net sale value or the value
in use, whichever is higher. The value in use is calculated on the basis of estimated future cash flows discounted at an
after tax discount rate that reflects the current market valuation with respect to the cost of money and the specific risks
associated with the asset. Future estimates have been established over a period of five financial years, except in cases in
which the remaining term of a lease agreement is less, plus a residual value.

The after-tax discount rates used by the Group for these purposes range in Europe from 7.3% to 11.5% and in
Latin America from 10.6% to 16.2% (without taking into account Argentina, where the after-tax discount rate has been
calculated taking into account its hyperinflationary economic situation and varies between 44.6% in 2021 and 35.6% in
2025, based on estimated inflation).

**_Onerous contracts_**

Onerous agreements are those which we have determined the costs of fulfilling the obligations exceed the
economic benefits expected therefrom. We evaluate the benefits expected on the basis of estimated future cash flows
discounted at an after-tax discount rate that reflects the current market valuation with respect to the cost of money and the
specific risks associated with the asset. We follow the principle of recording a provision at the present value of the
difference between the costs and benefits of the contract, or the compensation expected to be paid for abandonment of the
contract, if applicable. The pre-tax discount rates used reflect the current market value of money, as well as the specific
risks associated with these agreements. We used discount rates after tax used by the Group for these purposes range from
6.2% to 9.0% in Europe, and from 10.6% to 18.4% in Latin America for the year ended December 31, 2018. With the
application of IFRS 16 as of January 1, 2019, the existing onerous provision was allocated to the right of use line item.

Provisions for and evaluation of contingencies

We accrue a provision for probable liabilities relating to contingencies. The quantification of this provision is
based upon assumptions and estimates, which in turn are based upon information and knowledge that may vary over
time. Therefore, the final outcome of such contingencies may be significantly different from those considered during the
preparation of the financial statements.

**_Changes to accounting policies and new accounting standards_**

The accounting standards (IFRS) are subject to change from time to time. For a discussion of recent and pending
changes to the accounting standards (IFRS), please see Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2020 and see Note 1.a) of our condensed interim consolidated financial statements as of and for
the three months ended March 31, 2021.

**_Overview_**

According to Marketline, in 2019, the hotel industry generated approximately $946 billion in revenue worldwide

compared to approximately $916 billion in 2018, representing a growth rate of 3.2%. In 2020, the hotel industry is expected
to see its worldwide revenue decrease to approximately $692 billion, as a result of travel restrictions and lockdowns related
to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2020, Europe is expected to represent the second largest market with 31.7% of worldwide hotel industry

revenues, behind the Asia-Pacific region (34.8%) and significantly greater than the United States (22.0%). In Europe, the
hotel industry generated approximately $310 billion in revenue in 2019, representing a decrease of 1.1% compared to the
previous year. In 2020, the hotel industry's revenue is expected to decrease to approximately $220 billion, as a result of
travel restrictions and lockdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Within Europe, Italy, the United Kingdom, France
and Spain are the largest markets accounting for respectively 16.5%, 15.3%, 10.8% and 10.0% of the revenue in Europe in
2020.

**_Industry evolution_**

**_Historical industry evolution_**

The global hotel industry has experienced strong and regular growth in recent years at a CAGR of 7.0% between

2011 and 2019. This growth resulted from the worldwide increase in tourism driven by continued global economic growth
and a consistent increase in consumer disposable income. These trends have mainly been observed in the Asia Pacific
region, especially in China and India, where a growing middle class increasingly has had the means and desire to travel
internationally, particularly for tourism reasons. Additional factors supporting the growth of the hotel industry include
increased air connectivity and the increasing affordability of flights, particularly from low-cost airline carriers.

Growth slowed during 2019 to 3.2% and a significant decrease of 26.8% is expected for 2020, as a result of the

impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The following chart shows revenue and revenue growth in the global hotel industry from 2011 to 2020 (with

The European hotel industry also experienced consistent growth in recent years, at a CAGR of 5.8% between 2011
and 2019. This growth was led by southern and Mediterranean Europe and, overall, Europe represents 51% of global
international arrivals in 2019. Despite the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the hotel industry in Europe is still expected
to generate an estimated $219.5 million of revenues in 2020, which remains above the levels achieved in 2011 and 2012.

**_COVID-19 pandemic_**

The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global pandemic of a contagious disease caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (or SARS-CoV-2) ("COVID-19"). As of May 19, 2021, more than 164 million cases
have been confirmed, with more than 3.4 million deaths attributed to COVID-19, making it one of the deadliest pandemics
in history. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant global social and economic disruption, including the largest
global recession since the Great Depression. Authorities worldwide have responded in an unprecedented global manner to
contain the spread of the disease by implementing international and regional travel bans, lockdowns, quarantines and
business closures. Travel restrictions and regional lockdown measures caused many hotels to close between mid-March
and May 2020.

Many establishments began reopening in June 2020 but a significant decrease in international arrivals and reduced
domestic travel significantly reduced occupancy rates. According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (the
''UNWTO''), international travel could have decreased by 60-80% in 2020 as countries across the world imposed flight
bans to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Since December 2020, several vaccines have been developed and are starting
to be distributed. On May 17, 2021, 27% of the European total population are estimated to have received at least one
vaccine dose and the populations of many Western Europe countries are already above 30%.

According to Savills Research, the ongoing successful vaccination rollout and containment of the virus is
beginning to allow certain countries to encourage tourists to travel again. This is also improving consumer attitudes towards
travel. For example, in Israel, those with a vaccine certificate can now visit hotels, gyms, bars and concerts, following the
world's quickest vaccination campaign. Iceland began welcoming back vaccinated tourists from any country as of
March 18, 2021, without a requirement to quarantine, with Greece following suit shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, progress
under the UK's vaccination program has allowed the government to outline a roadmap for the reopening of hotels. As of
March 31, 2021, the United Kingdom appears to have a far greater share of bookings from May through to September
2021, as compared to other major European countries, in line with more confidence regarding domestic summer travel
generated by the higher level of inoculation.

**_Forecast industry evolution_**

According to Marketline, the global hotel industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.9% per annum from 2020
to 2025. The industry is forecast to recover as pandemic-related concerns lessen throughout the region, while the improving
macroeconomic conditions of several countries serve to stimulate domestic demand as well as overseas demand across the
region. An immediate and significant recovery in demand is expected in 2021 once travel restrictions are lifted and
consumers resume leisure and business travel. The hotel industry in Europe is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.7% per
annum over the same period from 2020 to 2025.

**_Recent industry trends_**

**_Focus on Western Europe market_**

Western Europe, including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the

Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, is the largest tourism market in the world.

Capital cities in Western Europe have generally experienced an increase in hotel demand in past years, but supply

has remained relatively stable due to a lack of available sites and relatively high prices of land and buildings with which to
establish hotels. The development of low-cost airlines, many of which operate from major Western European hubs, has
contributed to an increase in passenger traffic and demand for short holidays, particularly to what have recently become
known as ''city-break'' destinations.

In 2019, RevPAR increased in most Western European countries. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, RevPAR has

significantly decreased in 2020 as a result of lockdowns, travel restrictions and limited tourist activity. Many establishments
had to close between mid-March and May 2020 and began reopening in June, but a significant drop in international arrivals
and reduced domestic travel significantly reduced occupancy rates. According to Marketline, in France, the hotel
occupancy rate was as low as 3.3 % on March 17, 2020 compared to 65.3 % on February 26, 2020.

The following tables show the historical evolution of occupancy rates, ADR and RevPAR by Western European

country from 2018 to 2020, as well as the historical evolution of European occupancy rates ADR and RevPAR by type of
hotel from 2019 to 2020.

**_Increased presence of online travel agencies_**

For hotel operators, distribution can be direct or indirect. Direct distribution means that bookings are made directly

through the central reservation office, online or using an application, by telephone or in the hotel directly. Indirect
distribution means that that booking is done through a travel agency or an online travel agency such as Expedia or Booking
Holdings (which operates booking.com, agoda.com, kayak.com). Over recent years, the share of bookings represented by
the online channel has increased as a result of mobile sales development and greater usage of hotels' applications.

The existence of online hotel search aggregators increases consumer awareness with regards to price, enhancing

customer power. Online reviews have a decisive impact on consumer decisions and the ability to easily make cancellations
online also gives customers greater power and flexibility. Online travel agencies have impacted the brand appeal of large
hotel operators by increasing consumers' awareness of quality and price. They also offer their own loyalty schemes and
discounts.

**_European investment activity_**

European hotel investment volumes grew between 2016 and 2019 (above 15% growth annually). Simultaneously,

139


-----

the share of hotel investment volumes within total commercial real estate investment across Europe, the Middle East and
Africa ("EMEA") has increased from 6.3% in 2016 to 8.2% in 2019, driven by the strong market performance and increasing
popularity of the asset class among investors seeking to diversify their portfolios. In 2020, hotel investment volumes
decreased by 66% to €9.4 billion, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The following chart shows the evolution of European hotel investment from 2016 to 2020, as well as the year-on
year change and the share it represents of total commercial real estate volume.

**European hotel investment volume evolution (2016-2020)**

Source: CBRE, March 2021

CBRE expect deal flow to pick-up towards the second half of 2021, as a result of sellers revising their position

based on further pressure on working capital, funders taking a more aggressive position, greater clarity on recovery and
the large volume of capital targeting hospitality real estate. With over 100,000 new rooms planned for 2021, many countries
in Europe have a material development pipeline comprising hotels that are already in construction.

**_Key industry drivers_**

**_Macroeconomic trends_**

The hotel industry is cyclical and generally follows, with a time-lag, general economic conditions, as observed

during the economic crisis from 2007 to 2009. There is a history of increases and decreases in demand for hotel rooms, in
occupancy levels and in rates obtained by owners of hotels through economic cycles. Variability of results through some
of the cycles in the past has been more severe due to changes in the supply of hotel rooms in certain markets or in certain
categories of hotels. The combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in
significant volatility in results for owners and managers of hotel properties. As the costs of running a hotel tend to be more
fixed than variable, the rate of decline in earnings will generally be higher than the rate of decline in revenues. Over the
past 15 years, there has been a positive correlation between Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") and travel and tourism
expenditure.

GDP Growth Growth in Travel and Tourism Expenditure

Source: World Bank, Statista

Global GDP continuously grew between 2011 and 2020, with the annual growth rate varying between 2% and
3.5% each year. After growth in global GDP of 2.8% in 2019, GDP is expected to contract by 3.3% in 2020, as a result of
the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and the unprecedented global response to contain the spread of the disease. The global
economy is projected to grow at 6.0% in 2021 and 4.4% in 2022.

Among advanced economies, the United States is expected to surpass its pre-COVID GDP level in 2021, while
many other regions are expected to return to their pre-COVID levels only in 2022.

In the euro area, after growth in GDP of 1.3% in 2019, GDP is expected to contract by 6.6% in 2020 and to grow
by 4.4% and 3.8% in 2021 and 2022, respectively (source IMF), driven by the roll-out of vaccines.

**_Travel and tourism activity_**

Tourist arrivals indicate general levels of activity in the hospitality industry. According to UNWTO, after an
increase in international tourists arrivals (overnight visitors) by 3.8% in 2019 reaching a total of 1,461 million globally,
demand for international travel decreased by 73.9% in 2020 to 381 million, amid new outbreaks and tighter travel
restrictions, and continues to remain weak at the beginning of 2021. The fall in international tourism arrivals by 73.9%
observed in 2020 is unprecedented over the past 30 years, and compares with a decrease of 4.0% during the global economic
crisis in 2009 and a decrease of 0.4% in 2003 during the SARS epidemic.

and 2020 (with figures for 2020 presented on an estimated basis).

Europe remains the world's most popular tourist destination with a share of 51% of global tourist arrivals in 2019,

according to UNWTO. This share increased to 58% in 2020. According to UNWTO, France, Spain and Italy are the first,
second and fifth ranked countries, respectively, in terms of the number of international tourist arrivals worldwide in 2019.

In the past decade, domestic and international air traffic volumes have increased, due to greater and cheaper

accessibility to air transport, as well as increases in disposable income and a greater need for travel as a result of the
internationalization of many businesses and industries.

Looking ahead, the UNWTO anticipates that the level of international tourist arrivals observed in 2019 could be

achieved again in 2023 or 2024, depending on the pace of the recovery in demand. A significant recovery is expected in
the short-term as vaccine distribution programs across Europe allow governments to ease travel restrictions and, in turn,
encourage hotel operators to re-open hotels.

**_Supply dynamics_**

Global hotel supply is unlikely to follow the pace of demand growth, in particular in Western Europe where

development is constrained by a shortage of land and high prices. This supply-demand imbalance is expected to continue.

According to STR data, in 2018, there were a total of 308,000 rooms in the development pipeline with 105,000 in
construction and 69,000 in final planning. In some cities, concerns about over-tourism and damage to residential quality of
life means that local authorities seek to regulate the development of new hotels in certain areas. For example, in Amsterdam,
the policy of "NEE, tenzij" meaning "no, unless", seeks to ensure that the development of hotels in central Amsterdam is
in the city's best interests, with projects that are creative, economically support the neighborhood, have a good social plan
and are sustainable. In Barcelona, there has been a four-year moratorium for construction of new hotels that ended in 2019.

Concurrently while some cities have low overall new supply levels, certain cities can have high pipelines (such as
London, which we believe has the highest pipeline).

**_Hotel operating models_**

The hotel industry is characterized by four main types of operating models: (i) owned, (ii) leased, (iii) managed
and (iv) franchised.

    - Under the ownership operating model, the hotelier owns the hotel and is responsible for multiple
aspects of its operations, with greater fixed costs, higher exposure to the cyclicality of the economic
environment and higher sensitivity to variations in RevPAR.

    - The leased hotel operating model relies on either (a) fixed long-term lease contracts, usually 20 to 25
years, providing for fixed rental payments or (b) variable lease contracts, usually of shorter durations
than fixed term lease contracts in which rental payments are computed as a function of results of
operations, such as hotel revenue. Many hotel leases include both fixed and variable components,
enabling the landlord to share in the successful results of the hotel while providing a minimum level of
income protection.

    - Under the management operating model, hotel operators contribute their expertise and operate the
hotel under their brand name in exchange for fees while hotel proprietors remain responsible for capital
investment and maintenance expenditures. Therefore, the hotel operator bears fewer costs and risks in
this operating model compared to the owned or leased hotel operating models.

    - Under franchise agreements, a brand owner provides franchisees the right to use its brand name for an
agreed duration in exchange for a portion of the revenues generated by the franchisees' hotel operations
in the form of licensing fees. No capital expenditure is undertaken by the franchisor. Such franchise
agreements are more common with respect to the economy and mid-scale hotel segments and tend to be
for a fixed duration, usually of five to fifteen years.

Operating hotels under management contracts or franchise agreements reduces the hotel operator's or franchisor's
exposure to economic and market downturns and requires fewer capital expenditures and other operational expenses.
Therefore, these operating models result in less volatility and higher margins compared to hotels operated under capitalintensive owned and leased operating models

**_Types of hotels_**

Hotels range by price and services and can be broadly classified from least to most expensive as follows:

    - **Economy or limited service hotels typically offer the lowest rates per room.**

    - **Midscale hotels typically offer rates that are higher than those of economy hotels and provide**
additional services such as food and beverage service beyond breakfast. Midscale hotels are
predominant in the European and North American markets.

    - **Upscale hotels, including upper-midscale, upscale and upper-upscale hotels, offer a broader range of**
products and services to customers, including meeting room facilities and multiple dining options.
Certain upscale hotels may be located in seaside destinations and may be tailored to vacation and
leisure travelers.

    - **Luxury hotels offer the highest rates. The clientele for luxury hotels is mixed, including both business**
travelers and more demanding leisure guests. Demand for this high-end category tends to be more
volatile and more exposed to cycles of economic contraction.

**_Barriers to entry_**

Entry on a small scale for a new player is possible, but given the importance of brand recognition and technology
for expansion, significant capital outlay is required to achieve a large-scale business. Regulation and the limited availability
of properties for development may also discourage new entrants (e.g. moratorium for new hotel licenses in Barcelona or
the policy of "NEE, tenzij" in Amsterdam).

Within the industry, where switching costs are negligible and competing on price alone is no longer a key to
success, brand recognition, presence in key locations and innovation help to attract first-time customers and repeat business.
Differentiation between brands becomes important, as one particular brand becomes synonymous with quality, price, or a
specific target audience. Major players therefore have a wide portfolio of brands, ranging from budget to luxury imprints.

Although entry of a new large-scale direct competitor is unlikely, a substitute that is becoming increasingly
prominent are online services such as Airbnb, FlipKey and Couchsurfing. For example, according to Marketline, Airbnb
listings of available accommodation worldwide as of December 2019 reached over six million, greater than that of the five
largest hotel brands combined. The average nightly price for an Airbnb booking varies across Europe. In the United
Kingdom, for instance, the average price is $87, whereas in Poland it is $36. This represents a relatively newer source of
competition to traditional hotel operators which has resulted in traditional hotel operators rolling out brands to attract
millennial consumers who typically favor Airbnb. For this reason, many European countries, such as France, Italy, the
Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and Portugal, have regulated the service, imposing booking fees, tourist taxes or limitation
on issuance of licenses.

**_Competition_**

The industry is dominated by large international players who compete intensely among themselves and with
numerous smaller independent local players. Independent, unbranded hotels are typically owned and operated by individual
owners whereas branded hotels are generally operated under franchise agreements, management agreements or lease
agreements.

A hotel brand is typically recognized by travelers and typically signifies consistent service and product standards
with which guests may be familiar, particularly in markets unknown to the traveler. Branding a hotel may also increase the
hotel's marketability through the brand's local, regional and international sales, marketing and distribution channels. Some
international hotel operators are large, have significant market share and operate under well-known international brand
names (e.g. AccorHotels, Best Western, InterContinental Hotels Group, Marriott and Whitbread), and others have
established a long-standing presence in certain regions or cities. In mid-size urban areas and suburbs of large cities, branded
hotel operators primarily compete with local and international chains, as well as independently owned and managed hotels.
Depending upon the class and location of the hotel, competition is based primarily upon price, including discounted and
promotional pricing, quality of facilities and services offered, physical location within a particular market and the ability
to earn and redeem customer loyalty program points. Hotel owners and operators are required to modernize, refurbish and
maintain their hotels on a regular basis in order to compete effectively with other hotels.

The European hotel market remains highly fragmented, with stand-alone hotels or small portfolios owned by local
operators comprising the vast majority of the market. Europe has the most competitive industry in the world due to the
prevalence of small players which encourages a price-competitive environment.

Independent hotel operators are being acquired by large hotel companies or joining them as affiliates to benefit
from their marketing power and customer loyalty schemes. This is reducing the share of the market operated by independent
hotels and increasing competition between market leaders. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated market consolidation
with smaller hotels struggling to manage the financial consequences of lockdown and reduced occupancy. Many
establishments have been forced to close or be taken over by leading hotel operators. According to Marketline, for larger
hotel chains with stronger balance sheets, the pandemic has provided a chance to acquire smaller, struggling establishments,
that could help larger companies accelerate their recovery post pandemic. The security that brands offer customers and
their economies of scale have generated outperformance relative to independents during previous crises, a trend expected
to continue as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, including through further consolidation and consumer
preferences.

**Business**

**Overview**

We are a leading international hotel operator and we are ranked among the top ten largest hotel chains in Europe
by number of hotel rooms, according to the latest available Hospitality On report. As of March 31, 2021, we operated
355 hotels consisting of 54,806 hotel rooms in 29 countries.

Based on a report by an independent market research firm, and measured by number of hotel rooms in
operation, as of December 2019, we were the third largest hotel chain in the Netherlands, the fourth largest in Italy and
Belgium, the fifth largest in Spain and Portugal and the eighth largest in Germany. Of the 355 hotels we operated as of
March 31, 2021, we owned 73 (or 22% by number of hotel rooms), we leased 229 (or 65% by number of hotel rooms)
and we managed 53 hotels (or 14% by number of hotel rooms) owned or leased by third parties pursuant to management
agreements. We believe that our versatile operating structure and our geographic diversity enhance our resilience to
industry cycles while also providing us with flexibility to take advantage of future growth opportunities.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, our net turnover was €320.4 million and our Adjusted EBITDA
was negative €426.5 million. Our net turnover and Adjusted EBITDA increased from €1,613.4 million and
€264.5 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2018 to €1,708.1 million and €319.4 million, respectively,
in the year ended December 31, 2019. Our net turnover and Adjusted EBITDA decreased from €277.0 million and
negative €31.4 million, respectively, in the three months ended March 31, 2020, to €61.2 million and negative
€112.3 million, respectively, in the three months ended March 31, 2021. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, our
Occupancy, ADR and RevPAR were 14.3%, €65.5 and €9.4, respectively. For further information on these performance
measures, see "Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Key factors
_affecting our financial condition and results of operation—Occupancy, Average Daily Rate (ADR) and Revenue per_
_Available Room (RevPAR)"._

We have a centralized business model that allows us to provide a consistent level of service to customers across
hotels in different regions and to achieve economies of scale. Our central corporate and regional offices provide our
hotels with a wide variety of key functions, including sales, reservations, marketing, administrative and IT systems.

We have strengthened our brand proposition by reorganizing our hotels into an upper-upscale segment, an
upscale segment and a mid-tier segment and we have developed the following core dedicated brands, each tailored to
represent a clearly defined level of service, quality and value:

    - _NH Collection is our upper-upscale urban segment brand, which consists of our best properties and is_
designed for clients that are willing to pay a premium for higher quality products and services;

    - _NHOW is our upper-upscale design brand, for which we do not have a standard design applied across_
all hotels. Instead, we have combined new forms of contemporary architecture, design and luxury by
prestigious architects and interior designers to create an elegant and extravagant experience for our
guests; and

    - _NH Hotels remains our core brand for our upscale segment hotels, which consists of urban hotels with_
higher standards and more detail-oriented product and service levels, and our mid-tier urban segment
hotels, which focus on delivering value and comfort for our customers.

Since their public tender offer in 2018, we have benefitted from the industry knowledge and support of MINT,
which operates over 172 hotels and resorts across Asia, Australia, Africa, the Middle East and South America. As a result
of the integration of the Group into Minor Hotels (an affiliate of MINT), the parties have agreed to a joint brand
positioning for all markets and segments, on the basis of the reciprocal master licensing agreement signed between the
parties on February 7, 2019 allowing each party to use the other party's corresponding commercial brands in the
geographical areas where each party operates. The brands covered by this master licensing agreement comprise Anantara,
Avani, Tivoli and Oaks (in each case with Minor Hotels as licensor) and the brands NH Collection, NH Hotels and
NHOW (in each case with the Group as licensor). As a result of this master licensing agreement, we have increased the
number of brands we offer in the luxury and upscale segment and currently operate six hotels in Europe under the luxury
Anantara brand and 10 hotels under the upper-upscale Tivoli brand:

    - Anantara is an award-winning and world-renowned Asian luxury brand offering both design and
service-led timeless experiences. Positioned in key markets around the globe, Anantara hotels, resorts
and spas open up a window to the modern character of their destination, upholding world-class
operational standards to make every stay uniquely personal; and

    - _Tivoli is a collection of upscale and deluxe properties in prime locations around the world. Tivoli is_
now a global brand, with destinations ranging from idyllic beach settings in Brazil to cosmopolitan city
spots across Europe and luxury locations in the Middle East. Every Tivoli hotel is unique. Some are
inspired by exotic surroundings, others offer a touch of metropolitan luxury. Each one delivers
consistent premium service combined with impeccable taste and comfort.

Since 2013, we have implemented various upgrades and refined our brands across our operations. This has
included investing in upgraded basic facilities, such as flat screen televisions and rain showers, and refining our dining
and beverage options. We have worked to align our hotels with particular brand aesthetics to create a comfortable and
standardized experience for our customers. We have also implemented a centralized pricing strategy which organizes
price by destination, allowing us to structure relative prices among our various hotels in each destination, and by room
type. Through this pricing mechanism, guests may choose to upgrade for more desirable features, such as a better view.
We have refurbished several of our leased and owned hotels, which have generally shown improved Occupancy,
RevPAR and ADR as a result, and have overhauled our IT systems, launching a new website and completing the
migration of our back office systems to SAP, an enterprise software system which integrates our front and back office
and computer reservation systems, in all business units ("BUs").

In the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year, all regions reported a decrease in RevPAR,
which is principally due to the low levels of occupancy beginning in March 2020 across all regions due to the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic. The second quarter of the year was the most affected quarter during the pandemic due to
lockdowns in various countries, temporary hotel closures and travel restrictions, which were reinstated in the last few
months of 2020. In particular, for our hotels in Spain, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by 71.4%, 22.9% and 63.0%,
respectively, in 2020 compared with 2019. For our hotels in Central Europe, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by
67.3%, 16.4% and 60.9%, respectively, in 2020 compared with 2019. For our hotels in Italy, RevPAR, ADR and
Occupancy fell by 75.4%, 22.3% and 68.3%, respectively, in 2020 compared with 2019. For our hotels in Benelux,
RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by 74.2%, 18.2% and 68.4%, respectively, in 2020 compared with 2019 and, in Latin
America, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by 76.7%, 21.7% and 70.3%, respectively, in 2020 compared with 2019,
which was also due to the negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

In the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter in 2020, all regions reported a decrease in RevPAR,
which is principally due to the low levels of occupancy beginning in March 2020 across all regions. The first quarter of
2021 has been affected by lockdowns in various countries, temporary hotel closures and travel restrictions, which largely
remained in effect during the beginning of 2021. In particular, for our hotels in Spain, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell
by 71.2%, 32.7% and 57.3%, respectively in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. For our
hotels in Central Europe, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by 88.4%, 29.6% and 83.5% respectively in the first quarter
of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. For our hotels in Italy, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by 65.9%,
25.6% and 54.2%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. For our hotels in
Benelux, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by 88.2%, 28.7% and 83.5%, respectively in the first quarter of 2021 as
compared to the same period in 2020 and in Latin America, RevPAR, ADR and Occupancy fell by 72.5%, 34.1% and
58.2% respectively, in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, which was also due to the
negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

We actively manage our asset portfolio, including our 73 owned hotels which had a book value of €1.3 billion as
of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, although we believe that the actual market value of such assets is higher, due
to the fact that prices at which we have been able to sell our assets in recent years have been typically higher than their
respective book values. Between June 2020 and February 2021, 30 owned hotels were appraised by third parties and
were assigned a market value of approximately €875 million, while their book value as of December 31, 2020 is recorded
as approximately €593 million. This means that market value for those 30 appraised hotels exceeds their book value by
approximately 48%. We regularly evaluate the performance of individual hotels to identify underperforming properties,
and aim to terminate, or not renew, lease agreements and management agreements for underperforming hotels, in
particular if they contain undesirable terms (such as management agreements with costly performance guarantees), as
well as to sell certain of our underperforming owned hotels and redirect our resources to markets and hotels where our
operations have been successful. One of the ways in which we actively redirect our resources is to increase the proportion
of our operations conducted under management arrangements in order to take advantage of the less capital intensive
nature of management arrangements.

In addition, we are actively working to continue to increase Occupancy and Average Daily Rates through
selective investments, including refurbishment of existing hotels and opening new hotels. We also intend to complete the
streamlining of our operating platforms to increase efficiency. To date, we have migrated most of our back office systems
to SAP, and we have invested in the development of our website (with a focus on a mobile-friendly interface as our
customers increasingly access our website through their mobile devices) with increased functionality in order to increase
the proportion of direct bookings. In the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, the proportion of

146


-----

revenue generated from our website grew from 11.5% to 14.3%. We also seek to reallocate our resources to grow in the
markets where we believe there is increasing demand for hotel rooms and where we currently have limited presence.
During 2020, we opened 11 hotels with 1,966 rooms in markets where we believe there is increasing demand for hotel
rooms and we closed 17 hotels with 3,866 rooms.

As of March 31, 2021, we have entered into agreements to operate 20 new hotels with 3,739 rooms (our
"committed pipeline hotels"), which are expected to commence operations mainly between 2021 and 2023. We will
operate our committed pipeline hotels under lease and management agreements with third-party hotel owners and most of
our committed pipeline hotels will be operated under our core NH Hotels and NH Collection brands. We estimate that we
will invest a total of approximately €30 million into our committed pipeline hotels between 2021 and 2023.

We are a public limited company (sociedad anónima) incorporated under the laws of Spain and listed on the
Spanish Stock Exchanges with an authorized share capital of €784,360,486 consisting of 392,180,243 shares as of
March 31, 2021. Our market capitalization was €1.6 billion as of June 11, 2021.

The following charts set forth the geographic breakdown of our net turnover for the twelve months ended March

Spain. In 1997, our shares were first listed on the Spanish Stock Exchanges. By 1998, we owned 88 hotels in Spain, we
were listed on the IBEX 35 index and we had expanded our operations into Latin America and Europe.

In 2000, we initiated a European expansion strategy aimed at creating a strong global brand in the urban hotel
segment. We acquired the Dutch hotel company Krasnapolsky Hotels and Restaurants N.V., and we added 14 hotels in
Mexico, with the acquisition of the Chartwell chain in June 2001. In 2002, 46 hotels in Germany, six hotels in Austria
and one hotel in Switzerland were added to our portfolio with the acquisition of Astron Hotels.

Between 2003 and 2005, our organic growth allowed us to enter new European markets, such as Italy and
Romania, as well as new cities such as London. We continued our international expansion strategy in 2007 and 2008
through the acquisition of the Italian Framon hotel chain and the remaining ownership interests in the Jolly Hotels chain,
in which we acquired an initial interest in 1999. In 2009, we entered into an agreement with Hesperia, a shareholder of
the Issuer at such time, pursuant to which we agreed to manage several hotels owned or operated by Hesperia.

In 2014, we acquired Intesa Sanpaolo's 44.5% shareholding in our joint venture NH Italia, which became a
wholly-owned subsidiary as a result of this acquisition, in exchange for an issuance of our shares.

Our arrangements with Hesperia were terminated in connection with the exit of Hesperia from our shareholding
in 2018.

In 2018, MINT launched a public tender offer for the share capital of the Issuer, which enabled it to reach a
shareholding of 94.13%. As a result of such tender offer and the integration of our businesses, the parties agreed to a joint
brand positioning for all markets and segments, on the basis of a reciprocal master licensing agreement, by means of
which each party licenses to the other party the use of its corresponding commercial brands in the geographical areas
where the other party operates. We operate a number of hotels in Europe under this agreement.

As of March 31, 2021, we operated 355 hotels consisting of a total of 54,806 rooms in 29 countries.

**Our strengths**

**_We operate in the hotel and travel industry, which benefits from key growth trends despite the effects of the COVID-_**
**_19 pandemic_**

In 2020, the hotel industry is expected to see its worldwide revenue decrease to an estimated $692 billion from
$946 billion in 2019, as a result of the travel restrictions and lockdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Europe
(which represents 31.7% of the global market), revenue generated by the hotel industry is expected to decrease to an
estimated $220 billion in 2020 from $310 billion in 2019.

However, according to Marketline, the global hotel industry is expected to recover quickly in the coming years.
It forecasts that the global industry will grow at a compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") of 10.9% from 2020 to 2025
and at a CAGR of 10.7% in Europe over the same period. The industry is forecasted to experience a significant recovery
from 2021 to 2022 in particular, as pandemic-related concerns are expected to lessen and the vaccination rollouts and
containment of the virus are expected to allow countries to encourage tourists to travel again.

the first half of 2021 and will build up in the second half of 2021 to recover to 2019 levels by 2023.

Once travel restrictions are lifted, an immediate and significant recovery in tourism-related demand is expected
and Europe is anticipated to be well placed to benefit from this trend. According to the United Nations World Tourism
Organization ("UNWTO"), Europe is the world's most popular tourist destination with a 51% share of global tourist
arrivals in 2019 and a 58% share in 2020. France, Spain and Italy were ranked as first, second and fifth countries,
respectively, in terms of the number of tourist arrivals in 2019. The UNWTO anticipates that the level of international
tourist arrivals seen in 2019 could be achieved again in 2022-2024, depending on the pace of the recovery in demand.

This recovery is expected to be a result of the continuation of several growth trends, which were paused due to
the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on the travel and hotel industry. The global hotel industry has experienced
strong and regular growth in recent years at a CAGR of 7.0% from 2011 to 2019. This growth was primarily due to the
worldwide increase in tourism driven by continued global economic growth and a consistent increase in consumer
disposable income. These trends have mainly been observed in the Asia Pacific region, especially in China and India,
where a growing middle class increasingly has the means and desire to travel internationally for tourism reasons,

particularly to Europe. Additional factors supporting the growth of the hotel industry include improved air connectivity
and the increasing affordability of flights, particularly from low-cost airline carriers in Europe. These trends are expected
to resume their positive contribution to the travel and hotel industry from 2021 onwards.

More broadly, improving macroeconomic conditions are also expected to stimulate the travel and hotel industry.
The past two decades have seen a positive correlation between growth in GDP and travel and tourism related
expenditure. The International Monetary Fund ("IMF") forecasts that the global economy will grow by 6.0% in 2021 and
by 4.4% in 2022. Among developed economies, the United States is expected to surpass its pre-COVID GDP level in
2021, while many other regions are expected to return to their pre-COVID levels in 2022. In the euro area, GDP growth
is expected to rebound by 4.4% in 2021 and by 3.8% in 2022. This is expected to be driven by the continued roll-out of
COVID-19 vaccination programs and a resumption of economic activity.

**_We are a leading European hotel operator with a large and diversified hotel presence and a strongly recognized brand_**

We are a leading international hotel operator, ranked among the top ten hotel chains by number of hotel rooms
in Europe (as of December 31, 2020) and the top 30 globally (as of December 31, 2019), with 355 hotels offering 54,806
rooms across 29 countries as of March 31, 2021. Based on a report by an independent market research firm, and
measured by number of hotel rooms in operation, as of December 31, 2019, we were the third largest hotel chain in the
Netherlands, the fourth largest in Italy and Belgium, and the fifth largest in Spain and Portugal, with a significant
presence in Latin America. Through our geographically diversified footprint, we are well positioned to take advantage of
favorable economic and travel trends in our various local markets, reducing our reliance on particular localities,
supported by a greater contribution from domestic demand, which was as follows in certain of our core countries (based
on 2019 figures): 67% in Germany; 60% in Spain; 48% in Italy; and 47% in the Netherlands.

Moreover, 95% of our hotels are located in urban markets and target the upscale segment of those markets.

Our core brands include NH Collection, NHOW and NH Hotels, and we aim to deliver a consistent customer
experience across all our hotels:

      - _NH Collection is our upper-upscale urban segment brand, which consists of our best properties and is_
designed for clients that are willing to pay a premium for higher quality products and services;

      - _NHOW is our upper-upscale design brand, for which we do not have a standard design applied across_
all hotels. Instead, we have combined new forms of contemporary architecture, design and luxury by
prestigious architects and interior designers to create an elegant and extravagant experience for our
guests; and

      - _NH Hotels remains our core brand for our upscale segment hotels, which consists of urban hotels with_
higher standards and more detail-oriented product and service levels, and our mid-tier urban segment
hotels, which focus on delivering value and comfort for our customers.

Furthermore, as a result of the integration with MINT, we have increased our brand offer in the luxury and
upscale segment. Under a reciprocal master licensing agreement signed in February 2019, we are licensed to use MINT's
brands and currently operate six hotels in Europe under the luxury Anantara brand and 10 hotels under the upper upscale
Tivoli brand:

      - _Anantara is an award-winning and world-renowned Asian luxury brand offering both design and_
service-led timeless experiences. Positioned in key markets around the globe, Anantara hotels, resorts
and spas open up a window to the modern character of their destination, upholding world-class
operational standards to make every stay uniquely personal; and

      - _Tivoli is a collection of upscale and deluxe properties in prime locations around the world. Tivoli is_
now a global brand, with destinations ranging from idyllic beach settings in Brazil to cosmopolitan city
spots across Europe and luxury locations in the Middle East. Every Tivoli hotel is unique. Some are
inspired by exotic surroundings, others offer a touch of metropolitan luxury. Each one delivers
consistent premium service combined with impeccable taste and comfort.

We operate most of our hotels under our core NH Hotels brand, which provides a strong branding identity. Our
brands have remained consistently visible and popular based on our average overall TripAdvisor and Google scores, as

For more information on our brands, please see "Business—Brand development". Of the hotels included in a
survey conducted in 2019 by GFK, we were the most recognized hotel brand in Spain, ranking second in the country in
the ''core target'' category in relation to brand prompted awareness, which includes business and city travelers. In the
Netherlands and Italy, we ranked fourth and fifth, respectively, in the same ''core target'' category.

In addition, we seek to achieve a growing presence in our other markets, and we seek to successfully expand our
operations into international markets. The European hotel market remains highly fragmented, with a significant portion

of hotels being independently operated, compared to an increasing shift away from independently operated hotels to
branded hotels worldwide. We believe that we are positioned to benefit from increasing levels of brand penetration, as a
result of increasing customer preferences for international and widely recognized hotel brands. We believe customers
prefer international hotel brands, especially compared to independent hotels at similar prices, and we believe we are wellpositioned to benefit from the opportunities to capitalize on the fragmented European hotel markets. Furthermore, our
widely recognized and well-marketed brand enables us to attract customers to our newly opened hotels. We believe that
we have established a reputation as a leading international hotel operator and that this enables us to optimize our market
share compared to local operators.

**_Strong operating performance before the pandemic and well positioned for an industry recovery_**

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, net turnover and Adjusted EBITDA steadily increased from €1,376.6 million
and €138.3 million, respectively, in 2015 to €1,708.1 million and €319.4 million, respectively, in 2019, with 2019 being a
record year for Adjusted EBITDA which has more than doubled since 2015.

The following charts set forth our net turnover and Adjusted EBITDA from 2014 to 2020. Our Adjusted
EBITDA margin in 2019 was 18.7%, which has steadily increased every year from 2015 when it was 10%.

We achieved similar trends of consistent growth in our Occupancy and ADR prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,
which we believe was directly due to our upgrading of our hotel portfolio by prioritizing the refurbishment of our hotels,
resulting in increased profitability. Profitability has also been impacted by the shift from leased to managed hotels.
Additionally, we have improved the quality of leased portfolios through targeted renegotiations, early termination and not
renewing certain lease agreements. For example, in the period from 2018 to 2020, there were 17 lease agreements that
were not renewed. Our portfolio optimization is focused on an asset-light structure with 14% of our properties managed,
22% owned and 65% leased, as at March 31, 2021. This includes 54,806 hotel rooms, which has remained consistent
over the past few years. Operating a similar number of hotel rooms, but higher quality assets, has helped us to build a
more profitable business.

The following charts set forth our Occupancy and ADR for the period from 2015 to 2020:

The hospitality sector faced unprecedented challenges in 2020 due to the severe impact of the COVID-19
pandemic. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our net revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, Occupancy and ADR decreased
by 68.6%, 202.7%, 65.1% and 20.2%, respectively, during the year ended December 30, 2020. Despite various
lockdowns and travel restrictions around the world, the operating and financial transformation we achieved in previous
years, together with the contingency measures implemented, have enabled us to address the challenges of this
extraordinary complex year and safeguard our business continuity. The flexible cost structure is one of our competitive
advantages, which has allowed for the reopening of more than 300 hotels since June 2020 to capture domestic customers'
demand, resulting in 80% of our portfolio being open in August 2020. Due to the impact of a second wave of COVID-19,
with new travel restrictions and lockdowns imposed after the summer, many hotels closed again, and the percentage of
hotels open in December 2020 dropped to 60%. However, since the beginning of 2021, the gradual roll out of
vaccination programs, together with the progressive easing of restrictions in some European countries, has allowed us to
accelerate the reopening of our portfolio. As such, at the end of May 2021, approximately 78% of hotels in our portfolio
were open.

In anticipation of travel restrictions being lifted, we believe we are well positioned for an industry recovery. The
recovery in domestic leisure demand is already noticeable and is gaining momentum, as Europe gradually increases its
vaccination rate, consumers gain confidence and governments start to ease restrictions. In 2019, the proportion of

153


-----

revenues coming from the business to customer channel was 60% with the remaining 40% coming from the business to
business channel. We believe that this historical business mix will facilitate our prospects for a recovery in our operating
performance, as we believe that demand from leisure travelers is more likely to rebound quicker than demand from
business travelers. Although we expect our leisure travelers to return more quickly than business travelers, we have
implemented initiatives to entice business travelers, including extended stays, providing discounts of up to 35% for stays
longer than seven days, large work spaces for business travelers to work in or use for group meetings, and virtual meeting
capabilities.

The following graph sets forth these initiatives in more detail:


**Up to 35% on stays from seven days to work away**
**from home during a long period or enjoy a longer**
**holiday vacation**


**New innovative business to business proposal with**
**exclusive spaces to work and organize small business**
**meetings taking advantage of all the benefits of our**
**hotels (day-use room, gyms, restaurant)**


**To enhance the value of the events reaching a greater**
**audience from different destinations combining in-**
**person and virtual attendees**

The recovery phase likely will be driven initially by domestic and intra-European demand. In 2019, intraEuropean demand representing between 71-76% of our revenues with domestic demand at 67% in Germany; 60% in
Spain; 48% in Italy; and 47% in the Netherlands during the same period.

Additionally, our hotels are in desirable and attractive locations and well-visited cities that are among the most
popular tourist destinations such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Madrid and Milan. Our hotels are located in city centers
close to tourist attractions. Due to travel restrictions, in the third quarter of 2020, domestic occupancy increased. This
demonstrates that our recovery is not fully reliant on international tourism normalizing to their pre-pandemic levels.

Our ability to benefit from an anticipated recovery in the industry is helped by our strong brand identity. In a
survey conducted in 2019 by GFK, we were one of the most recognized hotel brands in Spain, ranking second in the
country in the "core target" category in relation to brand prompted awareness, which includes business and city travelers.
In the Netherlands and Italy, we ranked fourth and fifth, respectively, in the same category. We also monitor customer

**_Robust cash flow generation following the completion of the investment program and significant action taken on costs_**
**_and cash flow to mitigate the effects of the pandemic_**

Our robust cash flow generation demonstrates that we are fully oriented toward improving efficiency to improve
our profitability. Following the completion of significant capital expenditure investments made from 2014 to 2016, our
historical operating cash flow generation has since offset our capital expenditure. Our Total net cash flow from operating
activities increased from €32.1 million in 2014 to €505.3 million in 2019, due in large part to the impact of IFRS 16, and
decreased to negative €94.1 million in 2020, mainly due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the same period,
our capital expenditure increased from €109.9 million in 2014 to €190.8 million in 2019, before decreasing to €105.5
million in 2020. We concluded a phase of heavy capital expenditure investment in 2016. From 2018 until March 2021,
we initiated a second phase of repositioning capital expenditure investments. Our adjusted operating cash flow (after
capital expenditure) increased from negative €77.8 million in 2014 to positive €37.2 million in 2016. This positive
operating cash flow (after capital expenditure) continued from 2017 to 2019 due to lower capital expenditure. The
successful completion of our investment program, together with renegotiations of our lease agreements to shift towards
variable leases, has enabled us to have a lighter asset structure, requiring less capital expenditure. Over the same period,
while maintaining substantially the same number of hotel rooms, our net turnover and Adjusted EBITDA have grown by
approximately 1.4x and 2.7x, respectively, or from €1,247.0 million and €119.5 million in 2014 to €1,708.1 million and
€319.4 million in 2019, respectively, demonstrating the increase of higher quality assets in our portfolio.

The following charts set forth our Total net cash flow from operating activities, capital expenditure and adjusted
operating cash flow (after capital expenditure) from 2014 to 2020.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant cost control measures and developed a
contingency plan to reduce our costs. This achieved our aim of minimizing costs whilst hotels were closed, preserving
our liquidity to meet operational needs and ensuring that hotel activity could be resumed efficiently and under maximum
guarantees in terms of health and safety. Given the lack of visibility on the pace of business recovery, the cost control
measures were implemented, and continue to be implemented, to minimize operational expenses and preserve liquidity.

In the nine months from April to December 2020, we were able to minimize our cost base and reduce our nonrent costs by approximately 61% and our costs including rents by approximately 52%. Excluding perimeter changes, the
decrease in total rents amounted to approximately 32%, explained by the €63.6 million increase in our fixed rent
concessions and our lower variable rents. We were able to secure certain temporary reductions in fixed leases starting in
the second quarter of 2020 and negotiations with a view to reducing rents will continue into the first half of 2021. In
addition, since April 2020, our cost base has decreased due to a reduction in our staff and operating expenses by
approximately 60% and 62.5%, respectively. This was achieved by downsizes in our workforce by means of furloughs,
shorter working hours and wage cuts, which have extended through mid-2021. Additionally, all Group staff travel has
been suspended since early March 2020 and non-priority third party advisory services have also been suspended. We
have also significantly reduced our marketing and advertising spend. Furthermore, members of the board of directors of
the Issuer have foregone all their remuneration for the rest of 2021, while the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
operating performance persists. As a result of our effective cost control measures, we were able to offset approximately
50% of the EBITDA decline in 2020. We continued to implement cost control measures through the first quarter of 2021
and successfully offset approximately 69% of the EBITDA decline during such period. Overall, from April 2020 until
March 2021, we have been able to minimize our cost base and reduce our non-rent costs by approximately 60% and our
costs including rent by approximately 51%, compared to the same period in the prior year, allowing us to offset
approximately 54% of EBITDA decline in the twelve months ended March 31, 2021.

To further preserve cash flow, we withdrew our 2019 dividend proposal of €0.15 per share, which would have
involved an estimated payment of approximately €59 million in 2020 and reduced our capital expenditure investments by
approximately €100 million, an approximate 50% reduction from our original investment plan for 2020. We reduced our
capital expenditure to €14.9 million in the first quarter of 2021 from €34.0 million in the same period of the prior year,
representing reduction of approximately 56%, and plan to maintain limited capital expenditure through 2021. In the first
quarter of 2021, our average cash outflow was approximately €29 million per month (75.5% of operating cash flow and
24.5% of investing and financial cash flow), a reduction from our average cash outflow of approximately €42 million per
month (67.9% of operating cash flow and 32.1% of investing and financial cash flow) in the year ended December 31,
2020.

**_Proactive strengthening of our capital structure and liquidity position_**

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken several pro-active steps to mitigate its impact on our
financial position and to strengthen our capital structure. During this time, we have maintained liquidity through taking
advantage of our available financing. This includes drawing €250 million under the Senior Secured RCF in March 2020
and amending the Senior Secured RCF in October 2020, pursuant to which the existing lenders extended availability
from September 2021 to March 2023 and waived the financial covenants stipulated in the Senior Secured RCF agreement
up to and including December 31, 2021, as well as a significant reduction to the levels required to be met until June 2022
(inclusive), with the next covenant testing at the original ratio levels not due until December 2022. We have since limited
repayments of the Senior Secured RCF to €14 million, leaving €236 million drawn as of March 31, 2021. Subject to
completion of the Offering, in June 2021, we again amended and extended the Senior Secured RCF until March 31, 2026
and an additional €6 million will be committed and the amount outstanding as of the Issue Date is expected to remain at
€236 million. In addition, in connection with the Offering, the lenders under the Senior Secured RCF have agreed to a
waiver of the financial covenants for the full year of 2022. The effectiveness of this waiver is conditional upon the
closing of the Offering on the Issue Date. See "Description of certain financing arrangements–Senior Secured RCF
_Agreement." We also drew €39 million under unsecured short-term bilateral credit facilities during 2020._

On April 29, 2020, we entered into a €225 million Term Facility Agreement, guaranteed up to 70% by the
,Instituto de Crédito Oficial (the "ICO"), which was fully drawn as of March 31, 2021. In addition, on May 18, 2020 we
also entered into a €25 million Sabadell Bilateral Facility Agreement also guaranteed by the ICO. To further mitigate the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in May 2021, we obtained a waiver of financial covenant testing until June 2022
(inclusive), as well as an extension of the maturity of these COVID Related ICO Facilities from 2023 to 2026. See
"Description of certain financing arrangements– Term Facility Agreement and Sabadell Bilateral Facility Agreement."
On May 12, 2021, we entered into the unsecured €100 million Shareholder Loan from our 94% shareholder, MINT.
Following the Offering, we intend to capitalize this debt (which we may do solely at our discretion) and carry out a
Rights Offering to minority shareholders at the same time. See "Description of certain financing arrangements–
_Subordinated Loans—Shareholder Loan."_

As of March 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our total net indebtedness
(excluding operating lease liabilities and the Shareholder Loan) would have amounted to €686.1 million, comprising
€1,051.0 million of indebtedness, less cash and cash equivalents of €364.9 million. Our total liquidity as of March 31,
2020, pro forma for the Transactions, would have been €395.9 million, including €31 million of available undrawn
amounts, which is comprised of €25 million available under bilateral credit lines and €6 million which will be made
available under the Senior Secured RCF. See "Capitalization." We have no significant debt maturities until 2023 (other
than €356.9 million attributable to the 2023 Notes, which are expected to be redeemed using the proceeds of the
Offering).

We also intend to continue our ongoing asset rotation strategy through sale and leasebacks during the second
and third quarters of 2021, with a focus on higher quality of assets, which we expect will generate net cash proceeds of
over €200 million to be applied towards enhancing liquidity and reducing debt.

In the past, we successfully reduced our net leverage from approximately 2.6x in 2017 to 0.6x in 2018 and 2019,
a reduction of approximately 200 basis points. We anticipate that our plans for ongoing debt optimization and liquidity
reinforcement, as described above, will provide stability and sustainability for the Group in the future.

**_Large, diversified and well-invested hotel portfolio in key urban locations_**

As of March 31, 2021, of the 355 hotels we operated, we owned 73, leased 229 and managed 53 hotels owned or
leased by third parties pursuant to management agreements. Most of our hotels are strategically located in key urban
markets (see "—We are a leading European hotel operator with a large and diversified hotel presence and a strongly
_recognized brand"). Our portfolio of 73 owned and operated hotels consists of 11,920 hotel rooms as of March 31, 2021,_
which represent approximately 22% of the rooms we operate. Our owned hotels are located in the Netherlands (23% of

of book value), Germany (6% of book value), Argentina (5% of book value) and other countries (6% of book value). The
book value of our 73 owned hotels was €1.3 billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, although we believe
that the actual market value of such assets is higher, due to the fact that prices at which we have been able to sell our
assets in recent years have been typically higher than their respective book values. In addition, out of our 73 owned
hotels, 30 hotels have been appraised by third-parties between June 2020 and February 2021, and such hotels, which have
a book value of €593 million as of December 31, 2020, have been assigned a total market value of €875 million, meaning
that market value for those 30 appraised hotels exceeds their book value by approximately 48%.

In 2020, we completed our investment program which started in 2014, involving €371 million of repositioning
capital expenditure, €75 million of investment from the owners of our leased hotels, €60 million in basic capital
expenditure and €50 million of IT capital expenditure. Our ADR increased from €79 in 2014 to €103 in 2019. We also
improved RevPAR from €53.4 for the year ended December 31, 2014 to €73.5 for the year ended December 31, 2019.
We believe this positive result was attributable to the investment program, including the refurbishment of existing hotels
and the opening of new hotels. Our refurbished hotels have generally shown improved Occupancy, RevPAR and ADR.
We believe our refurbishment and repositioning program has also significantly contributed to improved TripAdvisor and
Google review rankings, showing increases in the levels of quality perceived by customers. In 2020, we continued our
repositioning program with an investment of approximately €50 million.

**_Experienced management team that have a track record of operational improvement and have adapted well during the_**
**_pandemic, and demonstrable support from MINT_**

Our experienced and proven management team has an average of approximately 17 years' experience in the
hotel industry. We believe this has been instrumental to our growth and has successfully transformed our business into an
international hotel chain, with strong footholds in European markets as well as exposure to markets in Latin America.

In January 2017, we appointed Ramón Aragonés Marín as our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), who we
believe has in-depth knowledge of the Group and the industry in which we operate, strategic vision as well as strong
leadership and team management capabilities. Mr. Aragonés Marín has approximately 43 years of experience in the hotel
industry and has worked at the Group for the last 12 years.

Our management team continues to be fully committed to the implementation of our business plan and will
continue to seek opportunities to increase profitability going forward. As a result of the successful implementation of
strategic initiatives by our management team, our Adjusted EBITDA increased from €120 million in the year ended
December 31, 2014 to €319 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.

The hospitality sector has faced unprecedented challenges in 2020 due to the severe impact of the COVID-19
pandemic. Our operating (EBITDA growth) and financial (deleveraging) transformation achieved in previous years
together with the comprehensive contingency measures implemented have allowed us to address the challenges of this
extraordinary complex year and safeguard business sustainability. In addition, our management team took decisive
actions during the pandemic, including cost control measures, through a reduction in our staff and operating expenses
through temporary downsizes in our workforce, reductions in hours and wages and successful negotiations with our
landlords for temporary rent reductions. The management team also withdrew our 2019 dividend proposal and reduced
our capital expenditure investments. These measures enabled us to offset approximately 50% of revenue decline at the
EBITDA level in 2020. Our management team continued our effective cost reduction measures through the first quarter
of 2021 and successfully offset 69% of the revenue decline. The management team also took a number of measures to
protect liquidity. For more information, see "—Robust cash flow generation following the completion of the investment
_program and significant action taken on costs and cash flow to mitigate the effects of the pandemic". In addition,_
members of the board of directors of the Company have suspended their remuneration for 2021.

We also benefit from the industry knowledge and support of our controlling shareholder, MINT, which operates
over 172 hotels and resorts across Asia, Australia, Africa, the Middle East and South America. For more information, see
"Shareholders." MINT has demonstrated its financial support by granting a Shareholder Loan of €100 million to the
Company in May 2021. This is intended to enhance our liquidity and further strengthen our capital structure so that we
can address the challenges arising from the current industry environment from a stable financial position.

**Our strategy**

**_Position the hotel portfolio as best as possible to take advantage of the recovery in the tourism and travel industry_**

We will continue to position our business as a leading international hotel operator to take advantage of the
recovery in the tourism and travel industry and capture expected short term business-to-customer and leisure demand.

158


-----

The vast majority of our sales (93%) are from Europe where vaccination programs are accelerating and countries are now
emerging from lockdowns and travel restrictions. We are planning to take advantage of our strong positioning in each of
the European countries in which we operate and focus on the business-to-customer segment that represents
approximately 60-70% of business. To capture the short term demand, we plan to implement a strategic promotions plan
to secure short term business-to-customer and leisure demand.

We are well positioned to take advantage of favorable economic and travel trends in our various local markets,
supported by a high contribution of revenue from domestic demand, which was 67% in Germany, 60% in Spain, 48% in
Italy and 47% in the Netherlands based on 2019 total revenue figures. Overall, intra-European demand represented
between 71-76% of our revenues in 2019.

As a result of our flexible operating structure, we are competitively positioned to take advantage of increasing
tourism and travel demand in Europe and to maintain a progressive re-opening strategy that focuses on optimizing
profitability. We are focused on enhancing and recovering our brand standards of quality and experience, demonstrated
by our notable customer service and amenities, by implementing initiatives that cater to the needs of the business
traveler. We will redesign our approach to the corporate segment through new value proposition and account handling
model, focusing on unmanaged business. Although we expect leisure customers to return more quickly than business
travelers, we do have initiatives in place to entice business travelers. We will continue with the full roll-out of initiatives
to adapt to the new trends of business traveler including extended stays, large workspaces, and set ups for virtual
meetings. We offer "Smart Spaces," exclusive spaces for customers to work and organize small business meetings to take
advantage of all of the hotel's amenities. In addition, we offer hybrid meetings to enhance the value of events for our
business travelers, combining in-person and virtual attendees and reaching a greater audience from different destinations .
Through initiatives like these, we believe we are able to enhance our brand reputation and maintain our status as a top
hotel choice by travelers. For more information on our business initiatives, see "Business— Sustainability and
_Environmental, health and safety matters —Sustainability initiatives" and "Management's discussion and analysis of_
_financial condition and results of operations—The COVID-19 pandemic and related measures"._

In 2020, as part of our "feel safe" program, a best in class health and safety measure and SGS protocol, we have
implemented enhanced cleaning and disinfection protocols, food and beverage management protocols, social distancing
rules and air and water purification control, as well as new digital solutions. This new program, which was adopted as
part of our COVID-19 recovery strategy, comprises a set of health and safety protocols aimed at safeguarding health and
safety and allowing social distancing for both guests and employees. We reviewed all our procedures and made nearly
700 adaptations to our operating standards to preserve the health and safety of guests and employees worldwide. Grouped
into 10 main lines of action and supported by specialists in various fields, the measures implemented include the
digitization of hotel services and adapting sanitation processes, including social distancing regulations in operations and
the use of personal protective equipment, among others. We also reached a collaboration agreement with SGS, the world
leader in inspection, analysis and certification, which allows us to follow up on the measurement and diagnostics protocol
established to verify that our hotels are clean and safe environments. Due to the involvement of hotel managers and heads
of department, this plan progressed and we are committed to ensuring that employees adopt, follow and implement the
new health and safety standards at all our hotels and across operations. We have pursued a progressive and flexible
reopening of our hotels since June 2020.

**_Continue optimizing the portfolio in the mid-term_**

In connection with our repositioning initiative which started in 2014, we have invested approximately €371
million of repositioning capital expenditure between 2014 when the plan was launched and 2020. This initiative is now
completed and, as of December 31, 2020, a total of 107 hotels have been refurbished, representing approximately 30% of
our hotel portfolio. These hotels were selected as we believed they were the most likely to yield higher Occupancy and
ADR and to enhance the value of our owned and long term leased assets. Our refurbishment program involved
modernizing rooms and common areas by refreshing paint and floor coverings and replacing furnishings and finishings.
In certain hotels, we undertook the refurbishment of the entire building, including all mechanical, electrical and plumbing
systems. The hotels we have refurbished have generally experienced increased RevPAR as it can be extracted from the
Group RevPAR growth from €53 in 2014 to €74 in 2019 and the value of our hotels has typically increased as a result of
refurbishment. Although we have undertaken a capital-intensive refurbishment program, we have staggered the costs
over several years, and we therefore have the flexibility to substantially control or reduce such costs by restructuring our
refurbishment program as required.

In an effort to optimize our lease portfolio, we intend to implement selective refurbishments of certain hotels,
identifying attractive repositioning and investment opportunities to implement once the pandemic subsides, and to
renegotiate contracts (increase variable terms), extensions and terminations. We also intend to increase the number of
managed hotels we operate by utilizing our strong recognition as a hotel operator and our strong market positioning
ahead of potential movements in the sector. In Europe, we believe we have an opportunity increase our luxury segment

positioning through the Anantara Brand with an additional Anantara marketing campaign expected in the year, as well as
in the Resort segment where we have a strong presence, proven track record and high brand awareness, in particular in
our core geographies of Spain, Portugal and Italy (see "—Our strengths—We are a leading European hotel operator with
_a large and diversified hotel presence and a strongly recognized brand")._

**_Focus on digitalization, our loyalty program and pricing and sales channels to drive improvements in profitability_**

A key focus of the Group is to continue to be at the forefront of innovation, with an emphasis on digitalization,
which we believe will further improve our profitability. In recent years, our digital transformation has improved the
efficiency of our processes and systems, with a key achievement being the centralization of all of our properties and
functions onto a single integrated system. This fully-integrated digital platform (the "NH Digital Core Platform") is a
pioneering technological solution in the sector that has become the basis for us to expand our customer knowledge,
maximize efficiency and innovate on a large scale in all our value areas.

In 2019, we launched "Fastpass", a combination of three innovative services (Check-in Online, Choose Your
Room and Check-out Online), which gives customers full control over their stay. We believe we are the first urban hotel
chain in Europe to offer such services on mobile devices. This initiative also allows for quality and experience
enhancement by improving contactless and seamless transactions through the optimization of online check in/out
processes. In addition, in 2019, we also launched "City Connection", under the slogan "Stay in one hotel, enjoy them all",
whereby we offer our customers the convenience and added benefit to access and enjoy selective amenities at any of our
hotels in their destination city.

We are in the process of migrating our loyalty program from NH Rewards to Global Hotel Alliance ("GHA"),
increasing the visibility of our loyalty program and strengthening our guest database, with a view to making the Group
more competitive. GHA is the operator of an award-winning, multi-brand hotel loyalty program ("DISCOVERY"), and in
April 2021 we announced that the Group would join the alliance and merge the NH Rewards Loyalty Program with
DISCOVERY in early 2022. As one of the ten largest loyalty programs in the hospitality sector, with over 900
participating hotels, the DISCOVERY program allows the Group to utilize collective buying power and collaborative
marketing efforts, and opens up destinations across Asia, Australia and North America to our customers. GHA is
preparing to launch a redesigned version of its DISCOVERY program during the fourth quarter of 2021, which will
include a digital rewards currency and unique benefits and offers for local members. The migration to GHA will allow
the Company to benefit from a major global program with access to key feeder markets.

We plan to continue to optimize our pricing and revenue management strategy through additional technology
investments to push for automation.

**_Enhance operational excellence by additional efficiencies in fixed costs with a continuous optimization of our support_**
**_functions, including through digitalization_**

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a contingency plan to unlock structural cost savings
and adapt our operations, including reductions, concessions or deferrals of fixed rent expenses, early termination of
underperforming leases, certain headcount rationalizations, the negotiation of lower procurement costs with our
suppliers, the reduction and cancellation of certain capital expenditures and suspension of all staff travel and non-priority
advisory, marketing and advertising costs. In addition, we implemented a collective dismissal process at our central and
corporate services at the end of April 2021. We intend to maintain certain of these cost efficiencies after the pandemic
into 2022. In addition to the cost control measures taken in response to COVID-19, we are committed to increasing the
digitalization of hotel information and services. Our digital transformation has resulted in more efficient and improved
systems and processes, which we believe leads to further differentiation from our competition. The introduction of the
NH Digital Core Platform has allowed us to centralize all our properties and functions onto a single integrated system.
This is a pioneering technological solution in the sector that has allowed us to expand our customer knowledge,
maximize efficiency and innovate on a larger scale in all our value areas. In addition, we have utilized an advanced
online application, which can be accessed by any guest from their mobile device. The application provides all customers
with all the hotel information in an easily-accessible format, from information on the hotel's facilities and hours, to
ordering room service, making a reservation in the restaurant or requesting additional amenities. We have also
implemented additional initiatives, such as a housekeeping mobility application, tablets at the reception desks and
digitalization of reports, which optimizes our hotel managers' record of customers and supervision processes.

**_Focus on talent management and return to a "new normal"_**

Throughout 2020 and into 2021, we have taken measures to alleviate the significant impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on our business and profits. With this aim, and always with the purpose of protecting employment in the long
term as much as possible, we launched a contingency plan to temporarily reduce our staff and, as a result, adjust

160


-----

personnel costs to the new reality of the business, with contract suspensions, reductions in working days, hours and
wages and other temporary measures taken in accordance with employment legislation in each country. Even in such an
adverse context, we strive to maintain our corporate culture and commitment to our values, seeking coherence and
fidelity in our strategy with respect to our people, as a key factor in retaining the credibility and trust of our teams.

The initial aim at the beginning of 2020 was to consolidate key policies and projects within the Group's Human
Resources Strategic Plan; however all planned projects were put on hold due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Throughout the year, we still maintained a focus on our strategic pillars, but with each action and initiative re-evaluated
in the context of the complicated individual, social and corporate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic:

      - _Global leadership and talent management: We continue to promote leadership within the Group,_
focusing efforts and investment on internal talent that has the potential to make a difference in the
Group's strategy and to become models of our culture.

      - _Maximum performance and better workplaces: All employees are encouraged to develop and fulfil_
their potential, with high performance differentiated, recognized and rewarded, enabling them to
become our best brand ambassadors.

      - _Transformation and reinvention: We continually search for, assess and utilize opportunities to be more_
efficient (for example, outsourcing and digitization), evolving our working environment and acquiring
advanced analytical and predictive skills.

Within this working framework, we launched a multitude of initiatives to care for our employees during these
challenging times. For example, "With You" is an internal engagement project designed to give our teams tools, advice
and training resources to strengthen key skills during this phase, not just at the professional level but also to improve their
personal well-being. Using "With You", among other actions, employees have received content aimed at stress
management, accessed digital kiosks free-of-charge, had language classes within reach, been able to collect office
material to improve their remote working experience and had access to two external, international e-learning platforms
("Typsy" and "GoodHabitz"). Both platforms include multiple training resources so that each employee can work on their
personal development plan, gain new knowledge and, ultimately, continue investing in their professional growth. Our
"Room4People" program supports professional development and creates social projects in the communities in which we
operate, by promoting equal opportunities for employees and investing in career training and career support for young
people who are in an under-privileged situation. This is based on the premise of sustainable and ethical principles,
responsible culture and spirit of citizenship.

During 2020, we employed an average of 11,112 employees. Our corporate culture is based on the cornerstones
of diversity, equality and inclusion. Employees comprise 132 different nationalities and, as of December 31, 2020, 51%
of all staff were women. As a demonstration of our continuing commitment to gender equality, the Group, for the second
year running, was included on the Bloomberg GEI 2021 index, making us the only Spanish hotelier in the 380 companies
listed in the index. We pride ourselves on running a company that values our employees and creates a culture where
employees wish to continue working for a long time. The average age of employees in 2020 was 39.7 years old and their
average time with the Group is 9.4 years.

**_Best in class positioning on sustainability with continuous focus on areas of improvement_**

We are committed to improving the sustainability of our business operations, ensuring a safe and inclusive
working environment and respecting the communities in which we operate. We seek to safeguard natural resources by
reducing the impact of our operations on the environment. We believe that sustainable business practices can foster a
sense of community beyond our organization, reflecting a duty of care for the world and generating wealth for society.
To that end, we have developed our strategic approach to sustainability, known as "NH ROOM4 Sustainable Business,"
with three lines of action: NH ROOM4People; NH ROOM4Planet; and NH ROOM4 Responsible Shared Success, all of
which are based on the same premise of sustainable and ethical principles, responsible culture and a citizenship mindset:

      - Under NH ROOM4People, we promote internal professional development and create social projects in
the communities where we are present. We defend diversity and equal opportunities for our employees
and we invest in training and career support for our young employees to promote employee
engagement and growth. We also encourage volunteer work by our employees and take various
initiatives to contribute to a positive impact on local communities where we operate such as "Hotels
with a heart", where we provide accommodation for hospitalized children and their families;

      - Under NH ROOM4Planet, we commit to the environment, including responsible water management
and increasing our use of "green" energy sources, sustainable products consumption and taking action

-----

to address climate change. We have formalized our commitment to cut our impact on the environment
by announcing our initiative to reduce carbon emissions by 20% by 2030. In December 2020, we
scored a B rating with the Carbon Disclosure Project, recognizing our efforts in the battle against
climate change. We are continually working towards reduced emissions by increasing green energy
with onsite facilities, renewable energy sources, and water optimization. We are working closely with
our suppliers to create opportunities for sustainability to benefit everyone in the circular economy.

      - Under NH ROOM4 Responsible Shared Success, we convey human rights and ethical business
principles throughout our responsible value chain. We work directly with suppliers to develop
innovative and sustainable solutions and apply certain social and environmental criteria in selecting
partners. We also seek to include and engage our customers in our sustainable initiatives, whether by
generating opportunities to contribute socially or by promoting environmentally responsible behavior.
In particular, we have launched our "Green Stay" initiative which allows customers on extended stays
to decline room cleaning services, contributing to savings in water, energy and other resources.

As the result of our commitment to sustainability, we were awarded "Bronze Class" recognition in the
Sustainability Yearbook 2021, which is published by S&P Global, as well as recognized as an "Industry Mover" due to
the significant improvements achieved since the previous year. In addition, since 2013, we have been included in the
FTSE4GOOD Index due to our management of the business. For more details on our sustainability initiatives, see,
"Business―Sustainability and Environmental, health and safety matters―Sustainability initiatives".

**Principal business activities**

**_Hotel operations_**

We are a leading international hotel operator ranked among the top ten largest hotel chains in Europe by number
of hotel rooms, according to the latest available Hospitality On report. Based on a report by an independent market
research firm, and measured by number of hotel rooms in operation, as of December 2019, we were the third largest hotel
chain in the Netherlands, the fourth largest in Italy and Belgium, the fifth largest in Spain and Portugal and the eighth
largest in Germany. As of March 31, 2021, we operated 355 hotels consisting of 54,806 hotel rooms in 29 countries. All
our hotels are full-service properties that offer a range of amenities. Although we primarily operate in the mid-tier
market, our hotel facilities vary from upper-upscale hotels to mid-tier hotels.

We operate our hotels under three types of arrangements: hotels that we own, hotels that we lease and hotels
owned or leased by third parties that we manage pursuant to management agreements (including our franchise hotels).
The following table sets forth the total number of hotels and hotel rooms that we operated under each type of
arrangement as of the dates indicated.

We strive to actively manage our management and lease agreements by trying to re-negotiate conditions which
we believe are not favorable to us. This includes terminating leases of hotels with poor performance. As part of this
exercise, (i) we terminated five leases in 2014, five leases in 2015, four leases in 2016, five leases in 2017 and one lease
in 2018, one in 2019 and two leases in 2020; (ii) we re-negotiated more than 100 lease agreements from 2014-2019; and
(iii) we reduced our hotels with negative EBITDA from 66 in 2014 to 11 in 2019, excluding the allocation of centralized
and corporate costs to the business units. Our weighted coverage ratio for our leased hotels (calculated in connection with
each leased hotel by subtracting direct operational expenses from net turnover in a given period and dividing the amount
so obtained by the fixed rent paid in such period) was 1.3x in 2013 and 1.9x in 2018 and 2019. Likewise, our total rent
coverage ratio for the same period was 1.3x in 2013 and 1.8x in 2018 and 2019. In 2020, due to the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic, we agreed a number of temporary rent concessions for our leased hotels. There are two types of
temporary agreements: (i) pure rent concessions without changing the terms of the contract and (ii) rent concessions in
exchange of non-substantial changes in the contract terms (maturity extension or higher variable rent). We are focused on
achieving an optimized asset structure. From the year ended 2014 to the year ended 2019, while maintaining substantially
the same number of hotel rooms, our Adjusted EBITDA has grown by approximately 2.7x or from €120 million to €319
million demonstrating an increase in higher quality assets in our portfolio.

As of March 31, 2021, (i) our owned hotels represented 22% of our total rooms; (ii) our leased hotels
represented 65% of our total rooms; and (iii) our managed hotels represented 14% of our total rooms.

_Owned hotels_

As of March 31, 2021, we owned 73 hotels in Spain, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United
States and Latin America consisting of 11,920 rooms, representing 22% of the total number of hotel rooms we operated.
Unlike hotels we manage for third-party hotel proprietors, we are responsible for mortgage payments and taxes for our
owned hotels, and we directly employ the staff who operate our owned hotels. In addition to personnel expenses and
other operating expenses, as the owner of these hotels, we are responsible for maintenance capital expenditures and for
refurbishing our owned hotels to maintain consistent quality standards. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we spent
approximately 4% of owned and leased hotel revenues on maintenance capital improvements. Moreover, the value of our
owned hotels and our ability to realize gains from selling our owned hotels is affected by prevailing economic conditions
in the relevant markets.

_Leased hotels_

Our leased hotels account for the largest proportion of our operations by number of hotel rooms and net
turnover. As of March 31, 2021, we had 229 leased hotels consisting of 35,455 rooms, representing 65% of the total
number of hotel rooms we operate.

Under our lease agreements, we lease hotel buildings from hotel proprietors or other partners, and we are
entitled to the benefits and carry the risks associated with operating the hotel. We do not bear the risks of property
ownership and are not required to make a significant initial capital investment in the hotel, and we are not subject to
volatility in the real estate market to the same extent as if we owned the property. We derive revenue primarily from
room sales and food and beverage sales from restaurants, bars, conference facilities and in-room dining. Our main costs
arising under a lease agreement are the fixed or variable rent paid to the lessor, personnel expenses and other operating
expenses. Subject to applicable law and in accordance with market practice, under some lease agreements, we also
reimburse the owner of the hotel property for property taxes and property insurance.

Typically, our lease agreements include a minimum rent payment obligation that is independent of the revenue
generated by the hotel. The fixed rent is typically adjusted annually to take into account changes in a specified consumer
price index. Some of our lease agreements also include a variable rent clause under which we are obligated to pay the
higher of the minimum rent or a variable rate of rent based upon a percentage of the total revenue generated by a hotel or
based upon a percentage of gross operating profit. The terms and conditions of our lease agreements conform to the
requirements of applicable local law and incorporate local market practice.

Under a few of our lease agreements, we are required to invest an agreed percentage of the relevant hotel
revenue or a predetermined fixed sum in the maintenance of the hotel with respect to furniture, fixtures, operational
equipment and hotel building, excluding the façade and external structure. We typically spend approximately 4% to 5%
of our annual hotel revenue on the maintenance of owned and leased hotels. In certain circumstances when we expect it
will lead to improved results from a hotel, we invest in total refurbishment of the hotel. In addition, under most of our
lease agreements, the Group company that is party to the lease may transfer its benefits and obligations under the lease to
any of our other subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2021, we had provided project financing for approximately six of our
leased hotels in Austria, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, and we have an option to purchase those hotels at specified
prices and at specified times during the term of the lease.

In summary, our obligations and responsibilities as a lessee under lease agreements typically include:

    - maintaining and in certain circumstances replacing the furniture, fixtures and equipment;

    - generally maintaining the hotel building, other than the façade and external structure, and its fixtures;

    - under certain of our lease agreements, particularly in Germany and the Netherlands, assuming
responsibility for full structural repairs and insurance costs of the building;

    - maintaining an insurance policy typically covering contents, benefit loss and civil liability;

    - hiring, training and supervising the managers and employees who operate the hotels, and assuming full
responsibility regarding all obligations to employees;

    - obtaining and maintaining all permits and licenses necessary to operate the hotels;

    - paying either fixed or variable rent; and

    - under certain contracts, paying the property tax of the building.

However, there are important differences in local legal requirements among the different jurisdictions in which
our leased hotels are located. These legal requirements affect a number of matters, including our responsibilities
regarding maintenance, insurance and tax, the maximum lease duration and labor matters.

As of March 31, 2021, the average remaining term of our existing lease agreements was approximately 10 years,
not taking into account any extension rights we may choose to exercise. The following table provides information on the
expiry profile of our lease agreements as of March 31, 2021. The table does not reflect the renewal options provided in
certain of our lease agreements, under which we have the right to extend the terms of the agreement, or early termination
rights of some lessors in accordance with the terms of certain agreements.

Under certain of our lease agreements, the lessor may have the right to terminate the lease due to a persistent
and severe breach of our obligations. Under most of our lease agreements, we do not have the right to renegotiate rent or
other material terms of the contract, or to terminate the lease early, except in the case of a persistent breach of the lessor's
obligations, under certain circumstances specified in the agreement, destruction of the property or impossibility of
continuing the hotel business. However, we have been able to negotiate reduced rents for a portion of the lease term or in
some cases for the entire lease term by, in some cases, extending the term of the lease or increasing the variable rent. In
other cases, we have agreed rent reductions with lessors based on a legal opinion that there have been severe and
unforeseen changes in economic and market conditions (rebus sic stantibus) that warrant a change to the agreement.
Alternatively, we may pay the lessor a reduced rent based upon our analysis of market conditions and valuations without
the lessor's consent. We have also been able to mutually terminate some lease agreements and enter into franchise
agreements instead. We have been subject to disputes or litigation with the lessor from time to time in connection with
lessors' claims for the shortfall in rent payments, and we may continue to be subject to similar disputes or litigation in the
future. We are currently engaged in negotiations with some hotel owners to close hotels (and other premises) or to
renegotiate the terms of the lease in light of current market conditions and the unprecedented circumstances caused by
the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, as part of our efforts to manage and optimize our asset portfolio, we have achieved
significant rent savings by renegotiating and cancelling unprofitable leases in all BUs, primarily in Spain and Italy.

_Managed hotels_

As of March 31, 2021, we managed 53 hotels owned or leased by third parties, pursuant to management
agreements, consisting of 7,431 rooms, representing 14% of the total number of hotel rooms we operate.

Under our management agreements, we provide management services for third-party hotel proprietors. We
derive revenue primarily from base fees as a percentage of total hotel revenue and incentive fees as a percentage of the
gross operating profit or adjusted gross operating profit of the hotels included in our management agreements. In
addition, we may collect marketing fees for global marketing efforts based upon total hotel room revenue, and, under
some management agreements, we receive a technical assistance fee for providing advice to the hotel owner regarding
hotel construction.

Under our management agreements, the hotel proprietor is responsible for all investments in and costs of the
hotel, including personnel expenses, funding maintenance and repair and insuring the hotel property. Moreover, these
agreements generally require that the hotel owners, or owners of the leasehold interest in a hotel, as the case may be,
invest a specified percentage of annual revenues to refurbish and maintain the hotels in accordance with operating
standards we establish. We advise the hotel proprietors regarding all necessary activities for operating the hotels,
including procuring food, beverages and other inventories, marketing the hotels, establishing room rates, processing
reservations and staffing the hotels, although we do not directly employ the staff at any hotel owned or leased by a third
party. As an established hotel operator under the management model, our influence over hotel operations enables us to
deliver a consistent standard of quality across our branded hotels, regardless of the operating arrangements.

Our responsibilities and scope of authority under our management agreements typically also include:

    - administering the hotels, including preparing budgets, advising on accounting, purchasing, marketing
and other commercial matters;

    - advising hotel owners regarding personnel hiring and remuneration, and supervising and training the
hotel staff;

    - installing and training the hotel staff to use our computer systems and applications for hotel
management;

    - advising and supervising the use of our logos and name in accordance with our policies; and

165


-----

    - advising the hotel owners on designs for facilities, decoration and furnishing of the hotels.

Unlike our lease agreements, our management agreements do not vary significantly among jurisdictions. In
certain countries, such as Germany and the Netherlands, management contracts are less common due to commercial
reasons. In these countries, we pursue and undertake lease agreements instead of management agreements.

Under a few of our management agreements, we guarantee the hotel owner a minimum result measured by gross
operating profit. Under most of these agreements, in the event that the actual result of a hotel is less than the guaranteed
amount during a specified period, typically two or three consecutive years, we have the option to compensate the hotel
owner for the shortfall or, if we elect not to pay the hotel owner, the hotel owner may terminate the agreement, in which
case we have no further obligations to the hotel owner.

As of March 31, 2021, the average remaining term of our existing management agreements with third parties
was approximately 5 years. The following table provides information on the expiry profile of our management
agreements as of March 31, 2021. The table does not reflect the renewal options provided in certain of our management
agreements, under which we have the right to extend the terms of such agreement, or early termination rights of some
hotel proprietors in accordance with the terms of certain agreements.

2031-2043 ..................................................................................................................................... 9 1,681

**Total ..............................................................................................................................................** **53** **7,431**

Under our management agreements, we do not have the right to terminate the contract prior to its expiration,
except in the case of a persistent breach of the hotel proprietor's obligations or other circumstances specified in the
agreement.

_Operational structure_

We currently operate our hotel business according to the following geographical BUs. As of March 31, 2021,
we operated 120 hotels consisting of 15,728 rooms in Spain, Portugal, Andorra, France, Tunisia and the United States,
which comprise our Spain BU for purposes of our operating structure; 51 hotels consisting of 10,152 rooms in Belgium,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Ireland which comprise our Benelux BU for purposes of our
operating structure; 74 hotels consisting of 13,231 rooms in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic,
Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, which comprise our Central Europe BU for purposes of our operating structure;
55 hotels consisting of 8,321 rooms in Italy which comprise our Italy BU for purposes of our operating structure; and 55
hotels consisting of 7,374 rooms in Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Uruguay, Haiti, Cuba and Brazil
which comprise our Americas BU for purposes of our operating structure. Although we do not currently have plans to
change our business units, we may do so in the future.

Our board of directors approves our business plan and budget, and our executive or delegate committee is
responsible for executing a Group strategy to implement the business plan and the budget. We have a decentralized
management structure, under which each BU has a manager that is responsible for preparing business plans to execute
the Group's strategy within each of their respective BUs. Certain key responsibilities are divided between our BU
managers and operations managers. Each business plan for each BU is then implemented locally by regional managers,
who are accountable for customer, owner and employee satisfaction at individual hotels in addition to supervising and
supporting hotel general managers. Under our decentralized management structure, individual hotel general managers are
responsible for the profitability of their respective hotels and the proper implementation of our strategy as it relates to
their respective hotels, while also achieving our global service standards.

Our Group headquarters in Madrid, Spain provides centralized services such as financing, sales and marketing,
purchasing, technical support and building and engineering services, as well as tools such as information systems,
procedures and metrics. However, as part of cost savings initiatives over the past few years, we have outsourced our
janitorial services where more efficient to do so, and have outsourced accounts payable and accounts receivable
management and general accounting ledger functions to our shared services center with Accenture. Finally, our Group
headquarters manages the deployment of our global guidelines, business plan and budget.

-----

The book value of our owned hotels as of March 31, 2021 was €1.3 billion.

We develop and grow our portfolio of hotels both strategically and on an opportunistic basis. In the markets
where we already have a substantial presence, we intend to use our relationships with our existing partners to achieve
further growth by entering into new leases or management agreements with these partners. We seek to grow in the
markets where we believe there is increasing demand for hotel rooms and where we currently have limited presence,
including into new international markets where we have identified significant potential. As of March 31, 2021, we
entered into agreements to operate 20 new hotels with 3,739 rooms (our "committed pipeline hotels"), which are
expected to commence operations mainly between 2021 and 2023. We will operate our committed pipeline hotels under
lease and management agreements with third-party hotel owners and most of our committed pipeline hotels will be
operated under the core NH Hotels brand. We intend to strengthen our presence in our strategic markets in Europe and
Latin America by entering into management, franchise and variable lease agreements over the next four years, during
which time we expect our three core brands will become more developed and our hotel portfolio will become stronger.

**Valuation of the Collateral**

Duff & Phelps has carried out a market valuation as of December 31, 2020 of the Mortgage Properties and the

(1) According to the Duff & Phelps Report, as of December 31, 2020, the market value of the NH Italia Shares was
€936.0 million. The Duff & Phelps' valuation of the NH Italia Shares deducts total financial liabilities of NH
Italia, which were €38.8 million as of December 31, 2020. As the projections include rent expenses, lease
liabilities are excluded from total financial liabilities.

After giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, as of March 31, 2021, an aggregate amount of €636.0 million
of our outstanding indebtedness would have been secured by the Collateral, of which €400.0 million would have
consisted of indebtedness under the Notes.

**_Basis of valuation and assumptions_**

The valuation described above was prepared on the basis of certain qualifications, assumptions, estimates and
projections. In delivering its conclusion of value, Duff & Phelps considered the three generally accepted approaches used
for estimating the market value of an asset: market, cost and income. The appropriate approach for estimating the market
value depends on the nature and the circumstances surrounding the asset under consideration.

_Valuation of the hotels_

Duff & Phelps based its valuation of the appraised hotel properties on historical financial information of the
appraised hotel properties from 2008 through 2020, the book value of non-current fixed assets of the appraised hotel
properties as of December 31, 2020, prospective financial information for the appraised hotel properties for 2021 through
2025, which reflect our estimates of the future performance of the assets included in the valuation, and industry reports
published by third parties. Duff & Phelps analyzed published information concerning the economy and the industry in
which the assets operate to assess the ability of the assets to generate future investment returns.

Duff & Phelps' valuation is also based on its assessment of the status of the economy as of December 31, 2020.

Duff & Phelps considers the financial and other information we have provided to it to be true and accurate and
has not conducted any audit, verification, technical or legal inspection or investigation of title to or any liabilities against
any property appraised. Duff & Phelps has assumed that our claim to the properties is valid, that the property rights of the
owner are good and marketable and there are no encumbrances that cannot be cleared through normal processes, unless
otherwise stated in its report.

Duff & Phelps' hotels valuation was based on the income approach, using the discounted free cash flow ("DCF")
valuation method, which according to Duff & Phelps, is the generally accepted approach for the valuation of businesses
or assets on a going-concern basis. Under the income approach, the current value of an investment is based on the
expected receipt of future economic benefits, such as cost savings, periodic income and sale proceeds. Indications of
value are developed by discounting expected future cash flows available to the providers of the invested capital at a rate
that reflects both the current return requirements of the market and the risks inherent in the specific investment. Using an
income approach based on a normalized capital structure reflects the earning power of the company or asset without the
effect of entity-specific funding decisions.

Under the DCF method, annual future cash flows are estimated, then individually discounted back to the present
value. If the cash flow stream will continue beyond the forecast period, a normalized future cash flow attributable to the
invested capital is estimated, then capitalized and discounted back to present value. The summation of the discounted
cash flows during the forecast period plus the normalized cash flow after capitalization and discounting provides an
indication of the invested capital value.

_Valuation of the NH Italia Shares_

Duff & Phelps based its valuation of the NH Italia Shares on historical financial information of NH Italia from
2008 through 2020, the consolidated balance sheet of NH Italia as of December 31, 2020, prospective financial
information for NH Italia for 2021 through 2025, which reflect our estimates of the future performance of NH Italia, and
industry reports published by third parties. Duff & Phelps analyzed published information concerning the economy and
the industry in which the assets operate to assess the ability of the assets to generate future investment returns.

Duff & Phelps' valuation is also based on its assessment of the status of the economy as of December 31, 2020.

Duff & Phelps considers the financial and other information we have provided to be true and accurate and has
not conducted any audit, verification, technical or legal inspection or investigation of title to or any liabilities against any
asset appraised. Duff & Phelps has assumed that our claim to the NH Italia Shares is valid, that the property rights of the
owner of the NH Italia Shares are good and marketable and there are no encumbrances that cannot be cleared through
normal processes, unless otherwise stated in its report.

Duff & Phelps' valuation of the NH Italia Shares was based on income approach using the Discounted Cash
Flow method. This method uses the present value of forecast cash flows for NH Italia (enterprise value) adjusted by the
net debt as of valuation date.

Other appraisers may reach different valuations of our properties and assets. Moreover, the valuation of our
properties and assets included herein could significantly differ from the amount obtained from the actual sale of our
portfolio properties or assets, especially in a distressed or liquidation scenario. Accordingly, the Duff & Phelps valuations
should not be considered as a guarantee of present or future value of our properties or assets. See "Risk factors—Risks

**Sales and marketing**

**_Overview_**

Our marketing operations focus on building brand awareness, consideration and conversion through strategic
marketing and promotional campaigns, advertisements and other media and communications. Our distribution and
channel management network, e-commerce tools, yield management strategies and customer acquisition and retention
programs concentrate on developing a strong and loyal customer base. In addition, our global sales teams are located in
various strategic international locations to further support our brand awareness and represent us and our brands at key
industry events.

Our integrated sales, marketing and distribution operation allows us to:

    - respond to changing market demands in a more effective and timely manner;

    - execute multi-layered marketing campaigns that integrate direct sales, marketing communication and
electronic distribution;

    - focus on increasing our global market share measured by revenue and brand recognition;

    - maintain the integrity and consistency of our new brand architecture and positioning of our hotels and
resorts;

    - build value and customer insight by collecting data and inviting guests to join our permission-based
customer databases;

    - build a positive reputation with the media, industry and customers; and

    - manage our global distribution network more efficiently.

**_Global sales_**

The main goal of our global sales team is to make our brand the most visible and recognized name in the
market. We seek to achieve this goal by:

    - defining and executing sales generating goals and priorities in each region;

    - creating and sustaining the visibility of our brand;

    - building trade relationships with key clients in all segments;

    - building partnerships with travel partners in various regions;

    - capturing the right demand segmented for each of our brands.

176


-----

Our global sales team consists of 305 sales executives, who are part of our Spain, Benelux, Central Europe, Italy
and Americas BUs. Each BU has its own global sales team focused on developing and sustaining the most important
national and international key accounts in all relevant segments and is focused on offering targeted support and guidance
to all hotels in those markets. We also have sales executives specifically focused on our resorts. The vast majority of our
sales come from Europe, making up 89.5% of our net turnover in the twelve months ended March 31, 2021.

We have international sales offices in the United Kingdom and the United States, and we have a broad range of
sales tools that are available to aid the sales process, such as a meetings facilities directory which lists all our hotels with
conference facilities, a worldwide directory of all hotels in our portfolio and brand brochures, videos and websites. We
continue to emphasize the M&E segment through our relationships with third-party professional conference organizers or
our customers' corporate meeting planners.

We also participate in leading international trade shows, events and exhibitions. These exhibitions not only
generate new business opportunities, but also offer opportunities to increase the awareness of our brands.

**_Revenue management_**

Our revenue management department includes a revenue management team of over 185 qualified professionals
spread across all our BUs and the corporate revenue management team. The BU revenue management teams use a
sophisticated and advanced revenue management system to identify revenue opportunities in designated markets based
upon our analysis and forecasting. The opportunities identified by our BU revenue management teams form the basis for
our short-term and long-term segmentation strategies, strategic and dynamic pricing, yield management, account
strategies, channel strategies, marketing activities and meeting room and group strategies. Our standardized
communication system ensures that the revenue opportunities identified by our BU revenue management teams are
shared with our local and global commercial teams. This process also ensures that the commercial activities or initiatives
deployed by our central commercial teams, such as the Revenue Committee and Strategic Destination Review Process,
which identifies commercial opportunities at the property level, the regional level, the country or market level and the
global level and consolidates and reports these identified opportunities to the appropriate commercial management level,
are tailored to address the revenue opportunities we have identified. The BU revenue management teams also are
responsible for day-to-day management of price changes, yield, overbooking limits, channels and group evaluations.
Each BU is led by a director of revenue management in charge of a team of regional revenue managers dedicated to
specified geographical areas. Our centralized structure enables one revenue manager analyst to manage three to five
hotels depending on different factors, including the proportion of rates the revenue manager analyst manages a hotel's
size, level of demand or the number of distribution channels a revenue manager analyst has to monitor and manage.

The corporate revenue management department monitors our forecasting and analytics, pricing and revenue
management procedures and tools. Our corporate revenue management department focuses on establishing mid- and
long-term business forecasts for our relevant markets, including the markets from which our guests originate, key
destinations and feeder markets; ensuring effective communication among our commercial departments; developing new
forecasting methods; and analyzing past forecasting performance. It also defines our general business-to-customer and
business-to-business pricing structure; ensures our revenue management teams work according to standardized processes
and methods; sets pricing guidelines for marketing promotions; and seeks to set optimal prices across our hotel portfolio.
Lastly, our corporate revenue management department defines the key objectives and procedures for each area, monitors
the performance of each revenue management team and oversees revenue management training.

We follow an advanced and sophisticated "Open Pricing" pricing strategy, which adds flexibility to our pricing
policy, as we are not tied to fixed price points or fixed discounts. "Open Pricing" allows us to quickly adjust our prices to
market trends and price our offers at any value that we consider appropriate. We intend to continuously develop and
refine our revenue management, using technology and increased automation. The Group has recently launched NH+, a
new corporate segment aimed at ensuring market penetration in the business travel sector, given large corporations are
expected to cut travel budgets in the short term. This program offers a new value proposition and account handling
model, with the aim of capturing market share in small, medium and “unmanaged” accounts.

**_Reservations_**

Our direct distribution activities are divided into two key systems: hotel direct reservations and electronic
distribution. Hotel direct reservations are made directly with the hotel by telephone or email and include hotel contracted
business from local corporate accounts and tour operators and business and leisure accounts managed by the global sales
team. Individual reservations requested by telephone or email are processed through our central reservations office in
Madrid, and group reservations are processed through separate global sales offices, except for reservation requests in
markets where we do not have a regional reservation office, which are processed through the international group desk
based in Madrid. We have deployed an interactive voice response system that should make our central reservation office

177


-----

("CRO") more efficient. Direct electronic distribution is carried out primarily through our central reservation system,
which provides direct connections to our global distribution systems and our e-commerce portals. Our electronic
distribution system is the booking engine behind our website.

In order to optimize our channel mix, we also run indirect distribution activities through collaboration with
several third-party intermediaries, both online (such as OTAs) and through more traditional channels (such as tour
operators). During 2020, 50% of our sales were made through indirect sales channels. Commissions payable to third
parties depend on multiple variables, such as the applicable rate, the market segment (business or leisure), the property
booked, seasonality and volume. In 2020, 27% of our sales were booked through OTAs.

The following table presents the percentage of revenue by sales channels from 2017 to 2020:

**Percentage revenue by sales channel (2017-2020)**

**% of Revenue** **2017** **2018** **2019** **2020**

**Online** **10%** **10%** **11%** **13%**

**Other direct** **37%** **35%** **33%** **37%**

**Total direct** **47%** **45%** **44%** **50%**

**Agencies** **20%** **20%** **21%** **18%**

**OTAs** **25%** **27%** **27%** **27%**

**Tour operators** **8%** **8%** **8%** **5%**

**Total indirect** **53%** **55%** **56%** **50%**

We have strategic agreements with several e-commerce partners to further increase our reach in corporate,
leisure and business meeting market segments. For example, we have partnerships with a global distribution system,
several online travel agencies, Starcite (Lanyon) and C-Vent, M&E third-party websites. Other electronic distribution
activities include "pay for performance" e-marketing activities, including search engine optimization, pay-per-click and
banner advertising in key regional and international travel portals. In order to enhance our reservations process to
increase its accessibility for our customers, we are currently undertaking initiatives that will not only improve the user
interface and increase functionality for our clients but also improve our backend process. We believe that this initiative
will increase conversion rates and therefore increase our revenue.

**_Customer relationship management_**

We seek to reward customer loyalty through our customer relationship management strategy and programs.
These programs help us to retain loyal customers and acquire new customers by benefiting from promotions and referrals
and allow us to have a better understanding of our customer needs and how to address them. This is a vital tool to
communicate directly with our customers. We reward loyalty in various forms through our carefully targeted initiatives,
such as the NH Hotel Group Rewards loyalty program which allows our customers to have access to special rates, earn
credits that can be used to pay for accommodation and other services at our hotels and entitle members to other benefits
depending on the tier they achieve, such as room upgrades, complimentary high speed Wi-Fi and guaranteed room
availability. We first made our NH Hotel Group Rewards loyalty program available to our customers in 2004, under the
name NH World. In 2014, it was renamed NH Rewards and was re-launched again in 2018. The NH Hotel Group
Rewards loyalty program reached approximately 9.8 million members by March 31, 2021. The NH Rewards Corporate
campaign, already launched internationally, is attracting corporate customers on all markets. Through our customer
relationship management programs, we aim to create strong brand awareness and customer loyalty, and we are able to
communicate offers and promotions to a targeted audience. On February 28, 2021, the Issuer signed an agreement with
Global Hotel Alliance (GHA), operator of the multi-brand hotel loyalty program DISCOVERY, whereby in early 2022,
the Group will join the alliance and outsource the NH Hotel Group Rewards loyalty program and its loyalty platform
operation to GHA. This is intended to expand rewards available to customers and attract new and repeat customers.

We have an online tool called "Quality Focus On Line" through which we monitor all the main online review
sites, including Tripadvisor.com, Booking.com and Expedia.com. NH Hotel Group hotels have increased their average
TripAdvisor score, obtaining an average score of 8.5 during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 8.4
during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Moreover, NH Collection hotels obtained higher scores compared
to the rest of the hotels of the Group, receiving an average score of 8.9 as compared to an average score of 8.3 for the NH
Hotels brand for the year ended December 31, 2020. All hotel scores and written reviews are captured and displayed in a
user friendly way, consolidating results at the hotel, BU, Brand or corporate level, enabling users to compare different
periods. Additionally, the Quality Focus On Line tool monitors the scores and reviews received by the hotels of many of
our competitors, which enables individual hotels to check the scores and reviews of their direct competitors.

178


-----

Apart from online reviews, Quality Focus On Line also monitors the results of our own customer surveys. All
NH employees at our corporate offices and hotels have access to Quality Focus On Line. The consolidated results
produced by Quality Focus On Line are incorporated into our quality assurance assessment, which in turn is integrated
into our yearly management objectives for each hotel. Quality Focus On Line also includes capability to respond via
email directly to guests who have made comments or inquiries through the NH Customer Survey or Google review in an
effort to improve the customer service experience by enhancing interaction with our guests and attention to their needs.

**_Communications and public relations_**

Our communications and public relations team consists of regional functions and a corporate team, which
supports our brand, sales and marketing strategies and efforts, and which focuses on building a positive relationship and
reputation with the media and our partners, ensuring a consistent message. The primary aim of the team is to further
inform our partners about our strategic direction regarding brands, properties and services. The communications and
public relations team also works on a project basis with specialized agencies to support and promote brand awareness, to
generate higher visibility for all our brands and to add value to our brands by informing relevant consumer media. The
regional communication and public relations executives also initiate, plan, organize, establish and manage a regional
media network. They also advise the hotel general managers and regional managers on optimizing communication and
media opportunities. Our internal communications team also ensures that our employees and partners are kept informed
about our developments, strategies and tools.

**_Brand development_**

Our brand is supported by quality and service standards aimed at providing our guests with a consistent level of
service across our hotels and fostering brand loyalty. Of the hotels included in the 2019 survey by GFK, we were one of
the most recognized hotel brands in Spain, ranking second in the country in the "core target" category in relation to brand
prompted awareness, which includes business and city travelers. In the Netherlands and Italy, we ranked fourth and fifth,
respectively, in the same category. We will seek to continue to strengthen our reputation and brand through marketing
initiatives and campaigns. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we have completed the execution of the approximately
€371 million of investments (€320 million as of December 31, 2019) as part of our repositioning initiative launched in
2014. We plan to convert most of the eight high-end hotels that we agreed to operate as part of an agreement with
Covivio to the Anantara and NH Collection brands, after carrying out a repositioning program, which will be promoted
by Covivio, over the coming months.

We have adapted our pricing strategy in order to improve our competitiveness, as well as address the new
business environment as a result of the pandemic. After the first lockdown in March 2020, we shifted towards a more
flexible pricing strategy. For example, we implemented cancellation upon request policies, as well as a volume strategy
to gain market share. This change in strategy has created an advantage in overall RevPAR growth, as compared to our
competitors given the change in business mix, with a decrease in business to business groups. We believe that our
strategy for 2020 has been effective, which can be seen through our increase in market share, which we believe has
increased by 8.6% as compared to 2019 for European consolidated hotels.

In 2020, we adapted our marketing activities and investment as the wider market was significantly affected by
the pandemic, and implemented an operational strategy of re-opening hotels in destinations where there was demand and
where it made financial sense to do so based on applicable local laws and regulations relating to the pandemic. In our key
markets, namely Spain, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, and Portugal, we opportunistically targeted domestic businessto-customer demand (business-to-customer demand represented about 60-70% of business in 2019) and business-tobusiness demand, and the leisure demand which built in the summer, experiencing an unprecedented increase in CRMLoyalty and direct web sales as a percentage of total company revenues. We primarily utilized online media to implement
our advertising campaigns, with a strict focus on performance key performance indicators, taking advantage of our
historical brand awareness in relevant markets and doubled by public relations and communication efforts. Additionally,
we adapted and optimized our global commercial and marketing teams, as well as external key partnerships to cover
immediate tactical needs of capturing market share to ensure strategic flexibility for to meet future trends in travel.

Furthermore, we have capitalized on our new brand architecture. The reorganization of our hotels into three core
brands provides a clear defined level of service, quality and value for each brand. In particular, we segmented our
portfolio in order to distinguish the value proposition of our three core brands for the business and urban leisure traveler.
To aid this distinction and to maintain the position of each of these brands, all aspects of all our brands, including design,
technical services, graphics, promotion, training and finance were carefully planned. Each brand has been defined by the
following key positioning elements: appearance, products and services, guest experience, location and selling
propositions. We have developed communication materials and dedicated marketing efforts to support accordingly the
specific and distinct attributes of each brand. We believe this will help us improve the profitability and ADR for our core
upper-upscale and upscale segments, as well as the brands.

179


-----

NH Collection is our upper-upscale urban segment brand, which consists of our best properties and is designed
for clients that are willing to pay a premium for higher quality products and services. NH Hotels remains our core brand
for our upscale segment hotels, which consists of urban hotels with higher standards and more detail-oriented product
and service levels, and our mid-tier urban segment hotels, which focus on delivering value and comfort for our
customers. NHOW is our upper-upscale design brand, for which we do not have a standard design applied across all
hotels. Instead, we have combined new forms of contemporary architecture, design and luxury by prestigious architects
and interior designers to create an elegant and extravagant experience for our guests. As of March 31, 2021, NH
Collection, NHOW and NH Hotels represented approximately 24%, 3% and 66% of our total number of hotel rooms,
respectively. Our upper upscale collection, which is comprised of NH Collection and NHOW, increased from
approximately 24% at December 31, 2018 to approximately 28% at December 31, 2020, and remained at approximately
28% as of March 31, 2021.

As part of our repositioning program, we intended to continue investing in several of our core hotels to develop
them into upper-upscale hotels. However, our repositioning program was postponed due to COVID-19 and we are
currently investing in extraordinary capital expenditures and working on non-cancellable repositioning projects. In
addition, we plan to carry out quality assurance inspections on all hotels to monitor quality and performance according to
our predefined services and standards criteria. See "—Our strategy— _Continue optimizing the portfolio in the mid-term"._

Over the next few years, we intend to continue to develop and consolidate our brand portfolio and invest in all
our brands, building upon our brand reorganization and recent repositioning.

**Our customers**

Our customers are leisure and business travelers, including travelers staying at our hotels for meetings,
conventions and other events held at our hotels. During 2020, approximately 1.8 million customers stayed at one of our
hotels, a lower number than the 4.4 million customers that stayed in 2019, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on travel. Of these 1.8 million customers, approximately 50% were business travelers, compared to 64% in 2019.

**Competition**

Our main competitors are other midscale and upscale international and local chains. We primarily compete with
Meliá Hotels International, H10 Hotels, Barcelo, Eurostars, Best Hotels and AC Hotels by Marriott in Spain; Ibis,
Holiday Inn, Novotel, Marriott, Mercure, Park Inn; B&B Hotels, Best Western and Motel One in Germany; Sheraton,
Best Western, TH Resorts, Blusarena, Mercure, Unahotels and AC Hotels by Marriott in Italy; Holiday Inn, Novotel, Van
der Valk Hotels, Best Western, Golden Tulip Hotels and Bildeberg Hotels in Benelux; and Fiesta Americana Hotels,
Fiesta Inn, Holiday Inn, Camino Real and City Express in Mexico.

**Regulation**

We are subject to numerous national, regional and local laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in
which we manage, lease and own hotels, including those requirements relating to the preparation and sale of food and
beverages, building and zoning, data privacy, competition and general business licenses and permits. Our ability to
develop new hotel properties and to remodel, refurbish or add to existing properties also depends upon obtaining permits
from local authorities. We are also subject to laws requiring us to pay taxes or governing our relationships with
employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, hiring and terminating,
non-discrimination for disabilities and other individual characteristics, work permits and benefit offerings. National,
regional and local laws and regulations also require certain registration, disclosure statements, compliance with specific
standards of conduct and other practices with respect to operating hotels. Compliance with these various laws and
regulations can affect the net turnover and profits generated by the hotels we manage, lease and own and could adversely
affect our operations. We believe that our business is conducted in substantial compliance with applicable laws and
regulations, and we have not received any notice of non-compliance that may have material effects on our business.

The rating of our hotels is determined by designated authorities pursuant to standards in the jurisdiction in which
the hotel is located. To obtain a rating for our hotels, we first determine how and where we want to position the hotel or
hotel project from a commercial point of view as this will affect the type of client we attract, the rates we can charge and
the available sales channels, among other things. The location of a hotel also has an effect on the level of local
competition the hotel will face, the destination possibilities for our clients and the local law standards with which we will
have to comply.

After a decision is made regarding the positioning of the hotel, we must comply with the requirements set forth
in the classification rating and ensure that we are able to offer the products and services that our selected star

180


-----

classification demands. In addition, each of our hotels must also be aligned with NH internal standards for each hotel
category.

In Spain, the standards pertaining to hotel ratings and classifications are substantially the same across the
country even though the standards are regionally determined. A hotel rating is certified by the Tourism Regional
Authority after an extensive audit process ensuring all the required services, obligations and conditions are fulfilled. For
example, the standards dictate floor space in each room; dimensions of staircases; the availability of a safe, laundry
facilities and ironing equipment; opening hours of the hotel restaurant; ratio of parking spaces to number of hotel rooms
and the provision of doormen.

**Sustainability and Environmental, health and safety matters**

**_Regulatory matters_**

Our properties and operations are subject to certain legal requirements under various national and regional
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those related air and drinking water quality, air
emissions, the use and disposal of solid and hazardous materials or wastes and prevention and control for the
contamination of water, air and soil. We also be subject to restrictions under the terms and conditions of any licenses and
permits required for our facilities and operations. Violations of environmental laws or permits may result in the
imposition of fines or penalties, obligations to install pollution control or prevention equipment, damage claims for
personal injury or property damage and, among other things, suspension, either indefinitely or temporarily, of operations.
Environmental laws may also impose liability for clean up of contamination without regard to whether the owner or
operator knew of, or was responsible for causing, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. Although we are not
aware of any current material obligations for the removal of hazardous substances or any other environmental condition
at any of our locations, a discovery of hazardous or toxic substances in the future at any of our owned or operated
properties may adversely affect our ability to operate our hotels or to sell or rent our owned real property or to borrow
using our owned real property as collateral. In addition, persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or
toxic wastes at or to third-party locations may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such wastes at such
locations, regardless of whether such facility is owned or operated by that person.

We are also subject to other laws and regulations relating to preservation of wetlands, coastal zones and
endangered species, which could limit our ability to develop, use, sell or lease our real property. Future changes in
environmental laws or the discovery of currently unknown environmental conditions may have a material adverse effect
on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, European environmental regulations have
become increasingly stringent over the last decade and this trend is likely to continue.

We have an environmental management system for compliance with current regulations and control of potential
hazards that could damage the environment. This environmental management system has ISO 14001 environmental
management and ISO 50001 energy efficiency certifications and is reviewed annually according to the legal requirements
applicable in the countries to which we operate, as well as the recommendations of international organizations on best
practices in the hospitality industry.

**_Sustainability initiatives_**

We are committed to improving the sustainability of our business operations, ensuring a safe and inclusive
working environment and respecting the communities in which we operate. We seek to safeguard natural resources by
reducing the impact of our operations on the environment. We believe that sustainable business practices can foster a
sense of community beyond our organization, reflecting a duty of care for the world and generating wealth for society.
To that end, we have developed our strategic approach to sustainability, known as "NH ROOM4 Sustainable Business,"
with three lines of action: NH ROOM4People; NH ROOM4Planet; and NH ROOM4 Responsible Shared Success, all of
which are based on the same premise of sustainable and ethical principles, responsible culture and a citizenship mindset:

    - Under NH ROOM4People, we promote internal professional development and create social projects in
the communities where we are present. We defend diversity and equal opportunities for our employees
and we invest in training and career support for our young employees to promote employee
engagement and growth. In particular, we have created "With You", an initiative that channels
communications to all our employees offering advice and resources to foster their wellbeing and selfdevelopment. We also encourage volunteer work by our employees and take various initiatives to
contribute to a positive impact on local communities where we operate such as 'Hotels with a heart',
where we provide accommodation for hospitalized children and their families;

181


-----

    - Under NH ROOM4Planet, we commit to the environment, including responsible water management
and increasing our use of "green" energy sources, sustainable products consumption and taking action
to address climate change. We have approved an Environment and Energy Policy which, along with
our Corporate Environment Department, aims to prevent and reduce environmental risks and impacts.
We have formalized our commitment to cut our impact on the environment by announcing our
initiative to reduce carbon emissions by 20% between 2018 and 2030. As part of our environmental
certification program, we have an ISO 14001-certified environmental management system and an ISO
50001-certified energy efficiency system for accommodations, restaurants, meetings and events
services; and

    - Under NH ROOM4 Responsible Shared Success, we convey human rights and ethical business
principles throughout our responsible value chain. We have implemented numerous sustainability
initiatives which are integrated into our business strategy, as we believe sustainability and the safety of
our guests, employees and suppliers and other partners affects all areas of our business. As part of our
"feel safe" program, we have implemented enhanced cleaning and disinfection protocols, food and
beverage management protocols, social distancing rules and air and water purification control, as well
as new digital solutions.

We also seek to include and engage our customers in our sustainable initiatives, whether by generating
opportunities to contribute socially or by promoting environmentally responsible behavior. In particular, we have
launched our "Green Stay" initiative which allows customers on extended stays to decline room cleaning services,
contributing to savings in water, energy and other resources.

As part of our sustainability and safety initiative, we are also committed to the digitalization of the hotel
information and services through our Progressive Web App which can be accessed by any guest from their mobile
device. The application provides all customers with all the hotel information in an easily-accessible way; from
information on the hotel's facilities and hours, to ordering room service, making a reservation in the restaurant or
requesting additional amenities. This initiative not only contributes to supporting a safe environment for our community,
but also provides alternatives to face-to-face interactions and reduces paper printouts contributing to the sustainability of
our business. Apart from this mobile guest service, we have implemented other projects, such as a housekeeping mobility
app, tables at the reception desks and digitalization of reports, which improves our environmental impact by considerably
reducing the number of daily printouts and by optimizing hotel managers' record of customers and supervision processes
and "Fastpass", a combination of three innovative services (Check-in Online, Choose Your Room and Check-out Online)
which was launched in 2019, which gives customers full control over their stay.

As the result of our commitment to sustainability, we were awarded "Bronze Class" recognition in the
Sustainability Yearbook 2021, which is published by S&P Global, as well as recognized as an "Industry Mover" due to
the significant improvements achieved since the previous year. In addition, since 2013 we have been included in the
FTSE4GOOD Index due to our management of the business. In December 2020 we scored a B rating with the Carbon
Disclosure Project, recognizing our efforts in the battle against climate change. In 2021, we were recognized for the
second year for our efforts in promoting equality and diversity by the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index.

In addition, under our Senior Secured RCF, the applicable margin can be increased or reduced by 5 basis points
based on certain environmental, social and governance ("ESG") performance scores of the Issuer.

**Information technology**

We believe that investing in new systems and technology is critical to our growth. We are developing new
systems, technology and platforms as part of our business plan that we believe will allow us to improve our product
distribution, manage our operations more efficiently by helping us achieve economies of scale and better cultivate our
employees' talents. Our IT initiatives are designed to implement best practices in the industry. We invested €14.5 million
in 2019 and €8.3 million in 2020 continuing the overhaul our IT management systems across our entire business,
including centralizing our data collection, increasing automation of certain processes, continuing the development of our
website (with a focus on a mobile-friendly interface as our customers increasingly access our website through their
mobile devices) and also working on our new digital evolution roadmap, which we expect will further contribute to
increase our revenues, reduce our costs and positively affect our net turnover. As of March 31, 2021, all regions have
completed the migration of our back office and front office systems to SAP, an enterprise software system which
integrates our front and back office and computer reservation systems. In the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to
the same period in 2019, the weight of revenue generated from our website grew from 11.5% to 14.3%. SAP allows us to
outsource the administration of the hotels to a shared service center. The migration to SAP provides us with more
efficient access to data across our business, enabling us to enhance the customer experience we can offer, implement
economies of scale and, we believe, improve our competitiveness.

**Intellectual property and innovation**

We own and control a number of trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights, know-how
and other intellectual property rights. We are licensed to use technology and other intellectual property rights owned and
controlled by others, and we license other companies to use technology and other intellectual property rights owned and
controlled by us. In addition, we have developed certain proprietary software applications that provide functionality to
manage marketing, tours, gifting, sales, contracts, member profiles, property management, inventory management, yield
management and reservations.

**Insurance**

We have international umbrella insurance policies under which we are insured against certain risks, including
property damage, business interruption and civil liability claims brought by hotel guests. Our international umbrella
policies are centrally managed in cooperation with our insurance brokers and adjusted on an ongoing basis. We also
obtain local insurance policies to cover particular risks in the countries in which we operate. Deductibles and limits are
agreed upon as appropriate. We also have directors and officers insurance as well as travel and personal insurance for our
employees. We believe that our insurance coverage, including the maximum coverage amounts and terms and conditions
of the insurance policies, are both standard for our industry and appropriate. We cannot, however, guarantee that we will
not incur any losses or be the subject of claims that exceed the scope of the relevant insurance coverage.

**Seasonality**

Our industry is seasonal in nature. Based upon historical results, our hotels typically generate the highest net
turnover from April through June and from September through October. We generally expect our revenues to be lower in
the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters. See "Management's discussion and analysis of
_financial condition and results of operations—Key factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations—_
_Seasonality and weather"._

**Employees**

The Group strives to sustain our corporate culture and commitment to our values, seeking coherence and loyalty
in our current strategy with respect to our people, as a key factor in retaining the credibility and trust of our team
members. Our employees comprise 132 different nationalities and, as of December 31, 2020, 51% of all staff were
women. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had an average of 11,112 full time equivalent employees who
worked at our owned and leased hotels or in corporate positions. As of December 31, 2020, 1,411 employees were
employed by the owner or lessor at the hotels that we operate, but with whom we do not have a direct contractual
relationship. In 2020, we had an average of 1,824 temporary workers and 11,026 permanent workers out of our total
average of 12,850 full time equivalent employees. We employ temporary staff in order to give us the flexibility to reduce
staff during seasonal low periods of Occupancy and to adjust staffing according to M&E activities. We have outsourced,
in part, certain functions and services, including janitorial services at some of our hotels, reservations and technical
support, to third-party vendors, and we may outsource other functions in the future.

We cooperate with the works councils in each country in which we operate to comply with the European Union
directive on works councils (94/45/EC). In addition, in certain jurisdictions, we are also required to comply with certain
employment conditions, including minimum wage requirements set by certain local authorities. Collective bargaining
agreements that apply to our hotel employees are negotiated between the management of the relevant hotel and our
human resources department, on the one hand, and the unionized employees and their respective unions, on the other. In
general, these collective bargaining agreements are reviewed and revised biannually, depending upon the duration of the
agreement, for salary adjustments and other contractual terms. We have not experienced any significant strikes or similar
labor disputes with our existing employees in recent years that could have materially affected our operations.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we carried out temporary layoffs during 2020 and 2021 and, at the end
of April 2021, we implemented a collective dismissal procedure at our central and corporate services in Spain.

Within this working framework, we launched a multitude of initiatives to care for our employees during these
challenging times. For example, "With You" is an internal engagement project designed to give our teams tools, advice
and training resources to strengthen key skills during this phase, not just at the professional level but also to improve their
personal well-being. Using "With You", among other actions, employees have received content aimed at stress
management, accessed digital kiosks free-of-charge, had language classes within reach, been able to collect office
material to improve their remote working experience and had access to two external, international e-learning platforms
("Typsy" and "GoodHabitz"). Both platforms include multiple training resources so that each employee can work on their
personal development plan, gain new knowledge and, ultimately, continue investing in their professional growth. Our

183


-----

"Room4People" program supports professional development and creates social projects in the communities in which we
operate, by promoting equal opportunities for employees and investing in career training and career support for young
people who are in an under-privileged situation. This is based on the premise of sustainable and ethical principles,
responsible culture and spirit of citizenship.

During 2020, we employed an average of 11,112 employees. Our corporate culture is based on the cornerstones
of diversity, equality and inclusion. Employees comprise 132 different nationalities and, as of December 31, 2020, 51%
of all staff were women. As a demonstration of our continuing commitment to gender equality, the Group, for the second
year running, was included on the Bloomberg GEI 2021 index, making us the only Spanish hotelier in the 380 companies
listed in the index. We pride ourselves on running a company that values our employees and creates a culture where
employees wish to continue working for a long time. The average age of employees in 2020 was 39.7 years old and their
average time with the Group is 9.4 years.

**Legal proceedings**

From time to time, we are subject to certain legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. On
the basis of current information, we do not expect that the current claims, lawsuits and other proceedings to which we are
subject, or potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating to matters of which we are aware, will ultimately
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

_Former Shareholder_

Hesperia, our former shareholder, filed a claim against NH before the Commercial Court of Madrid no. 8 (the
"Hesperia Claim"), pursuant to which Hesperia seeks the annulment of certain resolutions passed by the meeting of the
board of directors held on June 12, 2018, including the appointment of Dillipraj Rajakarier as proprietary member of the
board of directors and the dismissal of José Antonio Castro Sousa as member and chairman of the executive committee
of the board of directors. On October 10, 2018, the Commercial Court of Madrid no. 8 admitted the Hesperia Claim, and
on November 12, 2018, we filed the relevant writ of defense arguing against and requesting the full dismissal of the
Hesperia Claim.

The hearing took place on the September 17, 2019, and the Court will have to resolve, either by indicating a trial
date, or by dismissing the claim. A new preliminary hearing took place on April 13, 2021, scheduling the main hearing
on February 8, 2022.

_Tax proceedings_

From time to time, we are subject to various tax proceedings and audits with tax authorities in respect of our
operations.

The Group assumed liability for any real estate transfer tax ("RETT") in connection with the sale of a hotel (in
the Netherlands executed in 2013. The sale was executed as a transfer of a going concern, and we believe it was exempt
from RETT. However, the Dutch Tax Authorities subsequently claimed that the exemption was not available because the
transaction did not qualify as a transfer of a going concern. As of March 31, 2021, the total amount of this claim, plus the
corresponding default interest, was €12.9 million. On March 25, 2021, the Court of First Instance rejected the Group's
defense. The Group does not agree with the decision of the Court of First Instance and we believe we have a meritorious
defense to the claim by the Dutch Tax Authorities. Accordingly, we have filed an appeal before the second judicial
instance.

We are also currently subject to a tax audit with tax authorities in Germany which is at an early stage. In
addition to the Dutch tax liability aforementioned, we are also subject to judicial tax proceedings in the Italy, Germany
and Colombia. We estimate that any potential tax liability which might arise in connection with the aforementioned tax
proceedings (including the potential Dutch tax liability), including penalties and interest, to be approximately
€19 million. In connection with the Italian tax liability, we have made provisions in our financial statements of €0.4
million. Tax proceedings (both judicial and administrative) pose a significant amount of unpredictability and, as a result,
we cannot forecast the outcome of any of these proceedings, when they may be resolved or the final amounts that may be
payable in connection therewith.

_Claim against the Spanish Government_

The Company has filed a claim of economic liability of the public administration ("Responsabilidad
_Patrimonial del Estado") for damages arising from its actions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, under the_

184


-----

provisions of Article 106.2 of the Spanish Constitution, and Article 3.2 of "Ley Orgánica 4/1981, de los estados de
_alarma, excepción y sitio", among other regulations._

_Leases_

In relation to the renegotiation and early termination of leases of certain of our underperforming hotels or for
other reasons, in some cases, we have unilaterally paid the lessor a reduced rent based upon our analysis of market
conditions and valuations. We have been subject to disputes and litigation from time to time in connection with lessors'
claims for the shortfall in rent payments, and we may continue to be subject to similar disputes and litigation in the
future, including in connection with our efforts through court proceedings to renegotiate and cancel leases of certain of
our underperforming hotels.

of directors. Where permissible by law, the committees may also inform certain decisions of the board of directors. As of

**Compensation**

The aggregate cash compensation (including fixed salary, variable remuneration and allowances) received by

€1.3 million, respectively. Additionally, the Group's senior management participates in an incentive compensation plan,
the third cycle of which commenced on January 1, 2019, as described below.

The General Shareholders' Meeting of the Issuer, held on June 29, 2017, approved a long-term share incentive
plan (the "Plan") for certain of our executives and key personnel that would allocate a number of the Issuer's ordinary
shares to the Plan's beneficiaries, based upon a percentage of their fixed salary according to their level of responsibility,
at the end of each of the cycles that form the Plan.

The Plan has a total duration of five years and is split into three separate and independent three-year cycles. The
first cycle commenced on January 1, 2017, the second cycle on January 1, 2018 and the third cycle on January 1, 2019.
The maximum amount set aside for the three cycles of the Plan is €16.2 million. The number of final shares to be
delivered to the beneficiaries will be determined by the achievement of certain objectives set at the beginning of each
cycle, which relate to business performance (recurring EBITDA and recurring net profit) and value generated for the
shareholders (share price growth and total shareholder return).

In order for beneficiaries to be entitled to receive shares under the Plan, they must remain employed by us on
each of the Plan's payment dates.

the Issuer, as a result of which MINT acquired, through its wholly owned subsidiary MHG Continental Holding

**Related party transactions**

We maintain various business relationships with related parties. Our material transactions and agreements with
related parties are summarized below.

**Hotel Management Agreements**

**_MINT management agreement_**

On February 7, 2019, the Issuer entered into a framework agreement with Minor International Public Company
Limited ("MINT") which regulates, among others, the provision and exchange of information amongst MINT and the
Issuer, the demarcation of MINT and the Issuer's preferred business geographical areas and market segments, in order to
avoid overlaps and to promote business opportunities, the establishment of a protocol for the approval of mutual business
dealings and related party transactions and the creation of a framework of rules to prevent potential conflicts of interest.
The framework agreement will remain in force as long as MINT maintains, directly or indirectly, control over the Group
and the Issuer remains a listed company. The framework agreement demarcates Asia, Africa, the Middle East and
Oceania as MINT's preferred business geographical area and Europe and America (excluding Canada and the United
States) as the Issuer's preferred business geographical area and calls for MINT and the Issuer to adjust their businesses in
order to accommodate the preferred business geographical areas. Such adjustments include intra-group transactions and
transfers or assignments of the management of properties.

In connection with the framework agreement, on February 7, 2019, the Issuer and MINT entered into a
reciprocal master licensing agreement, whereby both parties licensed the use of their respective trademarks in the
geographical areas where the other party operates.

From to time, the Group and MINT enter into management or management support arrangements in connection
with management and management support services relating to their hotels. On June 27, 2019, MINT sold to Invesco
Real Estate three hotels located in Lisbon and Invesco Real Estate simultaneously leased such hotels to the Issuer under
lease agreements with variable rent and minimum guarantees. In connection with this transaction, the Issuer and MINT
also entered into management agreements relating to the management by the Issuer of nine additional MINT's hotels in
Portugal.

On February 7, 2019, the Issuer and MINT entered into a Data Transfer Agreement for the purpose of sharing
personal data, in compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

On November 11, 2020, the Issuer approved the provision by NH Hoteles España (an affiliate of the Issuer) of
hotel management services to Lodging Management Ltd (an affiliate of Minor Hotels, which in turn is an affiliate of
MINT) for the management of the hotel "Anantara Tozeur", an Anantara branded hotel located in Tunisia.

**Affiliation agreement with Coperama purchasing center**

On February 25, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Issuer approved an affiliation agreement between
_Coperama, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company which provides procurement services in the hotel and restaurant_
industry, and Minor Hotels (an affiliate of MINT). Through the affiliation agreement, Coperama provides Minor Hotels
and its hotel affiliates with procurement services with the same scope, terms and conditions as provided to other nonrelated hospitality companies.

**Agreement regarding NH Hotel Group Rewards loyalty program**

On February 28, 2021, the Issuer signed an outsourcing and membership agreement with GHA Loyalty DMCC
("GHA"), operator of the multi-brand hotel loyalty program DISCOVERY, whereby in early 2022, the Group will join
this alliance and outsource the NH Hotel Group "Rewards" loyalty program and its loyalty platform operation to GHA.
Under the terms of the agreement, the NH Hotel Group "Rewards" loyalty program will be called NH DISCOVERY and
the Issuer will retain ownership of the database and the information on NH DISCOVERY and its participants.

The joining of the Group into GHA was qualified by the Issuer as a related party transaction given the fact that
MINT holds an approximate 30% shareholding interest in GHA, and Mr. Dillip Rajakarier (CEO of MINT and Director
of the Issuer) is also a Director on GHA's Board of Directors.

As a result of this transaction, Mr. Ramón Aragonés (CEO of the Group) has become a Director on GHA's
Board of Directors.

**Shareholder Loan**

In addition, on May 12, 2021, the Issuer, as borrower, and MHG Continental Holding (Singapore) Pte Ltd, an
affiliate of MINT, as lender, entered into an unsecured subordinated convertible term loan facility (the "Shareholder
Loan") for a principal amount of €100 million. The Issuer shall convert amounts owed under the Shareholder Loan into
shares of the Issuer. For more details, see "Summary―Recent developments" and "Description of certain financing
_arrangements―Subordinated Loans—Shareholder Loan"._

**Payments**

On March 31, 2021, the Issuer had a net balance pending payment of €297,000 (as compared to a net balance
pending collection of €342,000 in 2020, €1,443,000 in 2019 and €978,000 in 2018) with the Minor group.

In the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of an analysis of the fair value of the Issuer's holding recorded
as an asset available for sale, a provision for impairment was recorded in relation to loan receivables from associated
companies of €9.5 million and an expense of €5.6 million for the contribution undertaken to be made to the Issuer at the
close of the 2019 financial year, to carry out cancellation of such bank loans for which the Issuer acted as guarantor for
35.5%. The impact of both these items were recorded under "Impairment on financial investments" in our consolidated
comprehensive profit and loss statement.

If it becomes unlawful for any Lender (or for any of its affiliates) to perform any of its obligations under the
Term Facility Agreement and the Sabadell Bilateral Facility Agreement or to fund or maintain its participation in any
loan thereunder, upon serving notice to the Borrower, the available commitment of that Lender will be immediately
cancelled and, to the extent that the Lender's participation has not been transferred in accordance with the Company's
right to replace such Lender in the terms and conditions provided for under the Term Facility Agreement and the
Sabadell Bilateral Facility Agreement, the Borrower shall repay that Lender's participation in the loans made to that
Borrower on the last day of the interest period ongoing at that time for each loan.

Subject to certain exceptions and thresholds, prepayments of loans outstanding under the Term Facility
Agreement and the Sabadell Bilateral Facility Agreement are required to be made with the proceeds obtained from the
disposal of certain categories of assets and the recovery of insurance claims which are not previously applied in
accordance with the permitted uses provided for under the Term Facility Agreement and the Sabadell Bilateral Facility
Agreement.

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, if a Lender so requires and notifies the Agent within 10 days of the
Company notifying the Agent of the occurrence of the Change of Control, the Agent shall, by not less than 90 days'
notice to the Company, cancel the commitment of that Lender and declare the participation of that Lender in all
outstanding loans, together with accrued interest, and all other amounts accrued, immediately due and payable.

"Change of Control" is defined as any natural or legal person or group of natural or legal persons (other than
MHG Continental Holding (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. or any other affiliate of Minor International Public Company Limited)
acting in concert:

(a) acquiring shares in the Issuer so that the shares that it owns following such acquisition represent, at
least, 50.01% of the share capital of the Issuer or gaining control of the Issuer; or

(b) acquiring shares in the share capital of the Issuer that enable such person or persons to appoint, at least,

the majority of the members of the board of directors of the Issuer.

If:

(i) all or part of the ICO Guarantee granted in respect of a Lender's commitment is or becomes inexistent,
illegal, invalid or unenforceable for any reason or cause other than as a direct consequence of: (1) it
ceasing to be an eligible Lender for the purposes of being the beneficiary of an ICO Guarantee or
having breached its obligations vis-à-vis ICO, (2) a waiver, termination or rescission by such Lender of
such ICO Guarantee, or (3) an assignment of rights under this Agreement made by or to such Lender;
and

(ii) such Lender so requires and notifies the Agent and the Borrower,

the Company and the relevant Lender (and, if appropriate or convenient, the rest of the Lenders) shall negotiate
in good faith for a period of two months from the date of such notification the alternatives to the prepayment of such
Lender's participation in the loans including, without limitation, providing liens on assets of the Borrower or any
guarantor to secure such Lender's or all of the Lenders' obligations under the Term Facility Agreement and the Sabadell
Bilateral Facility Agreement or the refinancing of all or part of the loans outstanding. If the referred negotiation period
lapses without a solution satisfactory to the relevant Lender (and, to the extent their consent is required, the rest of the
Lenders), then the Borrower shall repay that Lender's participation in the loans made to the Borrower under the Term
Facility Agreement and the Sabadell Bilateral Facility Agreement within three (3) Business Days from the notification
delivered by the Lender to the Agent and the Borrower following the lapse of the negotiation period.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

The following is a summary of the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement dated as of November 8, 2013,
among, inter alios, the Issuer, NH Finance, S.A. and certain other parties who entered into the Intercreditor Agreement to
establish the relative rights of certain of the Group's creditors, including any Additional Senior Financings. The
Intercreditor Agreement was amended on September 29, 2016 and is expected to be further amended on or about the
Issue Date. For the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, "Additional Senior Financings" means debt, including the
Notes and the Senior Secured RCF, incurred by any member of the Group that benefits from a security interest in the
Collateral (the "Transaction Security") and that is not prohibited to be incurred under the Indenture, the Senior Secured
RCF Agreement or any other Senior Financing Documents (as defined thereunder).

The Intercreditor Agreement sets forth:

    - the ranking of the indebtedness under the Notes, the Senior Secured RCF and any other Additional
Senior Financing (together the "Senior Secured Debt" and the creditors to whom the Senior Secured
Debt is owed being the "Senior Secured Creditors");

    - the ranking of the security created pursuant to the Transaction Security;

    - the procedure for enforcement of the Transaction Security and any guarantee granted in favor of the
Senior Secured Creditors and the allocation of proceeds resulting from such enforcement;

    - the types of disposals permitted under distressed and non-distressed scenarios and the Security Agent's
authority to release the Transaction Security and guarantees granted in favor of the Senior Secured
Creditors in case of a distressed and non-distressed disposal;

    - the terms pursuant to which intra-Group debt will be subordinated; and

    - turnover provisions.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It does
not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and, as such, we urge you to read that document, because it, and not
the discussion that follows, defines certain rights (and restrictions on entitlement) of the holders of the Notes and other
Senior Secured Creditors.

_Priority of debts_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that all liabilities owed under the Notes, the Senior Secured RCF, and any
other Additional Senior Financing (including in each case, any liabilities owed pursuant to any guarantees given in
respect of such debt) will rank pari passu and without any preference between them and in priority to any intra-Group
debt.

_Ranking of security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Transaction Security will rank and secure the Senior Secured
Debt pari passu and without any preference between them, with the exception of the security interests over the NH Italia
Shares, which shall secure the Senior Secured RCF on a first-ranking basis and the Notes on a second-ranking basis.

_Enforcement and application of proceeds_

The Intercreditor Agreement sets forth procedures for enforcement of the Transaction Security. Subject to the
Transaction Security having become enforceable, Senior Secured Creditors whose Senior Credit Participations aggregate
more than 66[2][/3][% of the total Senior Credit Participations (the "Instructing Group") are entitled to direct the Security ]
Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security, as they see fit. The Security Agent will refrain from
enforcing the Transaction Security unless otherwise instructed by the Instructing Group. For these purposes, "Senior
Credit Participations" means at any time in relation to a Senior Secured Creditor, the aggregate amount owed to such
Senior Secured Creditor.

All amounts paid to or recovered by the Security Agent under the Senior Secured Debt documents or in
connection with the enforcement of any Transaction Security shall be held by the Security Agent and applied in the
following order:

202


-----

    - first, on a pro rata and pari passu basis in discharging any sums (including fees, remuneration, costs,
charges, liabilities and expenses (and including any taxes and VAT required to be paid)) owing to (i)
the Security Agent or any receiver, delegate, attorney or agent appointed under the Transaction
Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement; (ii) the Trustee and (iii) any creditor representative
in its capacity as such in respect of any Additional Senior Financing;

    - second, on a pro rata and pari passu basis to (i) the Trustee on its own behalf and on behalf of the
holders of the Notes; and (ii) any creditor representative in respect of an Additional Senior Financing
on its own behalf and on behalf of the creditors under such Additional Senior Financing, for application
towards the discharge of amounts owed under the Senior Secured RCF, the Notes (in accordance with
the Indenture) and any Additional Senior Financing, on a pro rata basis;

    - third, if none of the debtors is under any further actual or contingent liability under any of the Senior
Secured Debt documents, in payment to any person the Security Agent is obliged to pay in priority to
any debtor; and

    - fourth, in payment or distribution to the relevant debtors.

_Distressed and non-distressed disposals_

The Security Agent is authorized (without the requirement to obtain any further consent, sanction, authority or
further confirmation from any Senior Secured Creditor) to release from the Transaction Security any security interest (i)
over any asset which is the subject of a disposal that is not a Distressed Disposal (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) and is not prohibited by the terms of any Senior Secured Debt document (including a disposal to a member
of the Group); and (ii) any security interest (and any other claim relating to a debt document) over any other asset to the
extent that such release is in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Debt documents.

If to the extent permitted by applicable law a Distressed Disposal is being effected or the shares of a member of
the Group are being appropriated by the Security Agent, the Security Agent is authorized (without the requirement to
obtain any further consent, sanction, authorization or confirmation from any Senior Secured Creditor or other relevant
party): (i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over any asset subject to the Distressed Disposal or
appropriation; and (ii) if the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal or appropriation is the shares of a Group company, to
release such Group Company and its subsidiaries from any liabilities under borrowings and guarantees under the Senior
Secured Debt documents and Intra-Group debt documents.

_Intra-Group debt_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer and its subsidiaries party thereto that are creditors in respect
of intra-Group debt have agreed to subordinate intra-Group debt to the Senior Secured Debt.

Neither the Issuer nor any of its subsidiaries that are creditors in respect of intra-Group debt may accept the
benefit of any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of intra-Group debt unless such
action is permitted under the Senior Secured Debt documents or the prior consent of an Instructing Group is obtained.
Neither the Issuer nor any other subsidiary may make any payment, prepayment, repayment or otherwise acquire or
discharge any intra-Group debt if acceleration action has been taken in respect of any of the Senior Secured Debt unless
the Instructing Group consents or such action is undertaken to facilitate repayment or prepayment of the Senior Secured
Debt.

_Turnover_

If any creditor party to the Intercreditor Agreement (including the Security Agent, Trustee, Senior Secured
Creditors and creditors in respect of intra-Group debt) receives or recovers a payment (whether by way of direct
payment, set-off or otherwise) except as permitted pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, such creditor
shall hold such payment in trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay over such amounts to the Security Agent for
application in accordance with the provision described above under "—Enforcement and application of proceeds".

including, among others, negative pledges with respect to the secured assets; restrictions on change of control and
mergers with respect to the borrower; restrictions on selling, transferring or leasing the secured asset and restrictions

**Subordinated loans**

The following loans represent unsecured and subordinated obligations of the Issuer and will be subordinated in
right of payment to the claims of all creditors of the Issuer.

_Merrill Lynch loan_

On November 22, 2006, the Issuer, as borrower, and Merrill Lynch International, as lender, executed a
subordinated facility agreement (the "Merrill Lynch Subordinated Loan Agreement"). The loan under the Merrill Lynch
Subordinated Loan Agreement is subordinated in right of payment to the claims of all senior creditors, except for certain
obligations in the event of a winding-up pursuant to Spanish insolvency regulations. Under the Merrill Lynch
Subordinated Loan Agreement, the loan in the amount of € 40.0 million is to be repaid in full on the maturity date,
January 25, 2037. Interest on the loan accrues quarterly at a rate equal to the rate for three-month deposits in euro (as

_Shareholder_ _Loan_

On May 12, 2021, the Issuer, as borrower, and MHG Continental Holding (Singapore) Pte Ltd., as lender,
entered into a subordinated convertible term loan facility agreement for an amount of €100,000,000 (the "Shareholder
_Loan")._

The Issuer shall apply all amounts borrowed by it under the Shareholder Loan towards the general corporate and
working capital purposes of the Group.

Interest on the loan under the Shareholder Loan accrues during interest periods with a duration of 12 months at a
rate equal to EURIBOR plus a margin of 6% per annum. By way of exception, the first interest period will be from May
12, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Any interest accrued during each interest period shall be automatically capitalized on the
last day of such interest period.

The Issuer shall repay or convert into shares in the Issuer the loan under the Shareholder Loan in full on or
before: (a) if the Issuer exercises its right to convert the loan into shares in the Issuer, the date of conversion, and (b) if
the Issuer does not exercise its right to convert the loan into shares in the Issuer on or before December 31, 2026, on
December 31, 2026.

If the lender or its Affiliates cease to directly or indirectly control the Issuer or if a substantial part or all of the
Group's business and assets are transferred, the lender may accelerate the loan made under the Shareholder Loan,
provided that the Issuer shall be entitled to convert the loan into shares in the Issuer if that occurs. The Issuer may prepay
the whole or any part of the loan subject to certain requirements.

The Issuer is entitled to convert into newly-issued and/or existing ordinary shares in the Issuer, at any time on or
prior to December 31, 2026, the whole (but not part only) of the outstanding principal amount of the loan under the
Shareholder Loan, the capitalized interest thereof from time to time (if any) and the interest accrued (and not already
capitalized) up to (but excluding) the date of conversion. The issue price of the shares in the Issuer for the purposes of the
conversion shall be determined by the Issuer at its discretion, provided that such issue price will not exceed the arithmetic
average of the daily volume weighted average price of the shares on the Spanish Stock Exchanges during the period of 5
consecutive trading sessions ending immediately prior to (but excluding) the date of conversion. The issue price of the
shares that are expected to be issued in the context of the share capital increase that will capitalize the amounts owed
under the Shareholder Loan will be equivalent to the subscription price of the Rights Offering.

The rights of the lender under the Shareholder Loan are expressly subordinated to the rights of all other
unsubordinated creditors of the Issuer. Due to such subordination the lender shall not be entitled to receive or claim any
payment under the Shareholder Loan or otherwise in respect of the loan made thereunder or accelerate the loan or
otherwise declare the loan to be early matured, unless permitted under all the financing documents or agreements binding
on the Issuer (provided that such subordination may not prevent the Issuer from converting the Shareholder Loan into
shares as referred to herein above).

**Description of the Notes**

You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under the subheading “Certain
_Definitions”. In this description, the “Company” refers only to NH Hotel Group, S.A. and not to any of its subsidiaries._

The Company will issue €400 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2026 (the
“Notes”) under an Indenture (the “Indenture”) dated the Issue Date among itself, the Guarantors, BNP Paribas Trust
Corporation UK Limited, as the trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”), BNP Paribas Trust Corporation UK Limited, as
the security agent (in such capacity, the “Security Agent”), and BNP Paribas Securities Services, Luxembourg Branch, as
paying agent, transfer agent and registrar, and pursuant to a public deed of issuance (escritura de emisión) to be granted
pursuant to Spanish law on or before the Issue Date. The Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to
the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Indenture will not incorporate or include any of the provisions of
the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. See “Transfer restrictions.” The terms of the Notes are subject to the
provisions of the Indenture.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and certain provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement in their entirety. We urge you to
read the Indenture because it, along with the Intercreditor Agreement, and not this description, defines your rights as a
holder of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement may be obtained upon request as set forth
under “Where you can find additional information.” Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below
under “—Certain Definitions” have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will
have rights under the Indenture.

In accordance with applicable Spanish law, the Company will grant, on or prior to the Issue Date, before a
Spanish notary public, a public deed relating to the issuance of the Notes (the “Spanish Deed of Issuance”) that will be
presented for registration with the Commercial Registry of Madrid, on or around Issue Date. Additionally, the Indenture
will obtain the status of public document through the execution of the relevant public deed by the Company, the Trustee
and the Security Agent before a Spanish notary public on or around Issue Date.

Subject to compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness
_and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock”, the Company may also issue an unlimited amount of additional_
Notes at later dates under the Indenture (“Additional Notes”). Any Additional Notes that the Company issues in the future
will be identical in all respects to the Notes that the Company is issuing hereby (including with respect to Notes
Guarantees), except that Notes issued in the future will have different issuance dates and may have different issuance
prices. All Notes, including any Additional Notes, will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture,
including (without limitation), with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase; provided that
Additional Notes will not be issued with the same ISIN or common code, if any, as existing Notes unless such Additional
Notes are fungible with the existing Notes for United States federal income tax purposes. Unless the context otherwise
requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the Notes”, references to the Notes include the Notes
offered hereby and any Additional Notes actually issued.

For purposes of any covenant summarized herein, any reference to an amount in “€” shall mean, in respect of
any amount in any currency other than euro, the Euro Equivalent thereof.

**General**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will:

      - be a general senior obligations of the Company;

      - be secured on a first-priority basis along with obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility as described
below under “—Security—The Collateral”;

      - rank pari passu in right of payment with existing and future obligations of the Company that are not
subordinated to the Notes, including obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the COVID
Related ICO Facilities;

207


-----

      - rank senior in right of payment to existing and future obligations of the Company that are subordinated to
the Notes, including obligations under the Shareholder Loan;

      - be structurally subordinated to existing and future obligations of the Company’s Subsidiaries that are not
Guarantors;

      - be effectively subordinated to existing and future obligations of the Company that are secured by assets that

      - be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantors, as described below under “—The Notes
_Guarantees”._

As of March 31, 2021, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we would have had total Indebtedness,
including the Notes, of €1,051.0 million (excluding operating lease liabilities and the Shareholder Loan), of which €28.8
million represented Indebtedness of the Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors.

**_The Notes Guarantees_**

Each Notes Guarantee will:

      - be a general senior obligation of the applicable Guarantor;

      - be secured on a first-priority basis, along with the guarantees of obligations under the Revolving Credit
Facility, as described below under “—Security—The Collateral”;

      - rank pari passu in right of payment with existing and future obligations of the applicable Guarantor that are
not subordinated to such Guarantor’s Notes Guarantee, including guarantees of obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility and the COVID Related ICO Facilities;

subordinated to such Guarantor’s Notes Guarantee;

      - be effectively subordinated to existing and future obligations of the applicable Guarantor that are secured
by assets that do not secure the Notes Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing
such obligations; and

      - be structurally subordinated to existing and future obligations of any of the applicable Guarantor’s
Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.

As of the Issue Date, all the Company’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries”. However, under the
circumstances described below under “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries”,
the Company will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”. The Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

Not all Subsidiaries of the Company will initially guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation
or reorganization of any of the Company’s non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, those Subsidiaries will be required to pay the
holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Company.

**The Notes Guarantees**

The Guarantors will consist of certain of the Company’s Subsidiaries incorporated in Argentina, Austria,
Belgium, Chile, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain,
Switzerland, the Netherlands, the United States and Uruguay.

The Guarantors include both operating companies and various intermediate holding companies. The Guarantors
comprised 68.6% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020 and represented 84.4% and 73.9% of our net turnover and
EBITDA, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the Company and the Guarantors together comprised
80.5% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020 and represented 86.6% and 83.6% of our net turnover and EBITDA,
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020.

In addition, pursuant to the covenant entitled “—Additional Notes Guarantees and Collateral”, subject to
certain exceptions, any Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees certain Indebtedness of other entities shall also enter into a
supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Notes Guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The obligations of the Guarantors will
be contractually limited under the applicable Notes Guarantee to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to
maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the
Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. For instance, due to Italian laws on corporate
benefit, the guarantee provided by NH Italia will be limited to €90 million. For a description of such limitations, see
“Risk factors—Risks relating to the Notes and our structure—The Notes Guarantees and security interests in the
_Collateral are significantly limited by applicable laws and are subject to certain limitations on enforcement or defenses”_
and “—Fraudulent conveyance laws may limit your rights as a holder of Notes”.

**Release of Notes Guarantees**

The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of all the Capital Stock of that Guarantor or any sale or other
disposition of all or substantially all the assets of that Guarantor (including in each case by way of merger,
consolidation, amalgamation or combination) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such
transaction) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the
covenant described under the caption “Certain Covenants—Limitation on sales of assets and equity interests in
_Restricted Subsidiaries”, and all obligations of the Guarantor with respect to Indebtedness under the Revolving_
Credit Facility and the COVID Related ICO Facilities are also released;

(2) if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(3) upon legal defeasance or covenant defeasance or discharge of the Notes as described under the captions “—
_Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(4) as described under the caption “—Amendments, Supplements and Waivers”;

(5) in the case of a Notes Guarantee granted pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “Certain
_Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees and Collateral”, upon the discharge of the Indebtedness or the release_
and discharge of the guarantee that gave rise to the obligation to guarantee the Notes;

210


-----

(6) in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement; or

(7) in connection with a transaction permitted by the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Merger,
_Consolidation or Sale of Assets,” including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Permitted Reorganization and the_
Mexican Reorganization.

**Security**

**_The Collateral_**

Pursuant to the Security Documents, the obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Notes or the
Notes Guarantees, as applicable, will initially be secured by (i) a lien on the shares of capital stock representing 100% of
the share capital of (A) Immo Hotel Brugge, BV, (B) Immo Hotel Diegem, BV, (C) Immo Hotel Mechelen, BV,
(D) Immo Hotel Stephanie, BV, (E) Onroerend Goed Beheer Maatschappij Van Alphenstraat Zandvoort, B.V., (F) Hotel
Exploitatiemaatschappij Diegem NV and (G) NH Italia, S.p.A., which shall be a first-priority lien in the case of
subclauses (A) through (F) and a second-priority lien in the case of subclause (G) but deemed and treated as first-ranking
security interests under the Intercreditor Agreement (as such security, together with any other liens on the shares of
capital stock of a Person that secure the obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Notes, may vary or be
replaced from time to time, collectively the “Share Collateral”) and (ii) first priority mortgages over the following
properties located in the Netherlands: NH Eindhoven Conference Centre Koningshof owned by Koningshof, B.V.; NH
Conference Centre Leeuwenhorst owned by Leeuwenhorst Congres Center, B.V.; NH Zoetermeer owned by Onroerend
Goed Beheer Maatschappij Danny Kayelaan Zoetermeer, B.V.; NH Conference Centre Sparrenhorst owned by De
Sparrenhorst, B.V.; NH Capelle owned by Onroerend Goed Beheer Maatschappij Capelle aan den IJssel, B.V.; and NH
Naarden owned by Onroerend Goed Beheer Maatschappij IJsselmeerweg Naarden, B.V. (as such security, together with
any other liens on property that secure the obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Notes, may vary or
be replaced from time to time, the “Property Collateral” and, together with the Share Collateral from time to time, the
“Collateral”).

Following the Issue Date, the Company or the Guarantors will provide security to secure the Notes and the
Notes Guarantees on a pari passu basis with the Revolving Credit Facility (with the exception of the security interests
over the NH Italia Shares, which shall secure the Senior Secured RCF on a first-ranking basis and the Notes on a secondranking basis but deemed and treated as first-priority security interests under the Intercreditor Agreement), subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as described under "Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement"._

The Security Documents will be executed on the Issue Date or within five business days thereafter. The
Company has agreed to take all necessary actions as soon as practicable to perfect and make effective the security interest
to be granted in favor of the Security Agent (for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, among others) in the Collateral
pursuant to the Security Documents executed on the Issue Date or within five business days thereafter, subject, in each
case, to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and such Security Documents.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Liens”, the Company is permitted to pledge or cause its Subsidiaries to pledge the Collateral in connection with future_
incurrence of Indebtedness, including issuances of Additional Notes, permitted under the Indenture on a pari passu basis
with the then outstanding Notes. The Security Interests over the Collateral may also be released under certain
circumstances. See “—Release of Security Interests” below.

**_Administration of Collateral and Enforcement of Liens_**

The Collateral will be administered by a Security Agent pursuant to the terms of the Security Documents and
the Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of the Trustee and all holders of the Notes and the finance parties under the
Revolving Credit Facility and certain other future secured creditors pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. For a
description of the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement”._

The ability of holders of the Notes to enforce Security Interests over the Collateral will be subject to various
bankruptcy law limitations in the event of the Company’s bankruptcy and various limitations on enforcement contained
in the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk factors—Risks relating to the Notes and our structure—The enforcement of the
_Collateral may be restricted by Spanish law”, “—Fraudulent conveyance laws may limit your rights as a holder of_

211


-----

_Notes” and “—Local insolvency laws may not be as favorable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and insolvency laws of_
_another jurisdiction with which you may be more familiar”._

The rights of the holders of the Notes with respect to the Collateral must be exercised by the Security Agent.
Since the holders of the Notes are not a party to the Security Documents, holders may not, individually or collectively,
take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The holders may only act
through the Security Agent. The Security Agent will agree to any release of the security interests created by the Security
Documents in accordance with terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of
the holders of the Notes. Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the Notes will, in certain
circumstances, share in or have the ability to direct the Trustee to direct the Security Agent to commence enforcement
action under the Security Documents. However, in enforcing the Security Interests created under the Security
Documents, the Security Agent will take direction from the Trustee (subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement).
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”.

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, until the acceleration of amounts due under the Notes in
accordance with the Indenture, the Company and other pledgors will be entitled to exercise any and all voting rights in a
manner which does not materially adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the Security Interests created under
the Security Documents or the value of the Collateral and to receive and retain any and all cash dividends, stock
dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting from stock splits or reclassifications,
rights issues, warrants, options and other distribution (whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing) in respect of the
shares that are part of the Collateral.

The value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy the
Company’s and the Guarantors’ obligations under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, as the case may be, and the
Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the issuance of Additional Notes or other
future incurrences of Indebtedness and the disposition of assets comprising the Collateral, subject to the terms of the
Indenture.

There can be no assurance that the proceeds of any sale of Collateral, in whole or in part, pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents following an Event of Default, would be sufficient to satisfy the
amounts due under the Notes or the Notes Guarantees. By its nature, all of the Collateral is likely to be illiquid and may
have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral would be sold in a
timely manner or at all.

Neither the Indenture nor the Security Documents will restrict the Company from accessing any insurance
proceeds payable under insurance policies relating to the Collateral. If requested by the Company, the Security Agent
shall provide written confirmation to such effect directed to any relevant insurance provider.

The Security Documents will be governed by Dutch, Italian and Belgian law and will be subject to the
jurisdiction of the Dutch, Italian and Belgian courts, respectively.

**_Release of Security Interests_**

All of the Security Interests granted under the Security Documents will be automatically and unconditionally
released in accordance with the terms and conditions in the Indenture upon Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance as
described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance”, if all obligations under the Indenture are discharged in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture or as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture, including but not
limited to the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interests”, the Security Documents
and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Security Interests over the Collateral granted under the Security Documents will be released if:

(1) (a) the LTV Ratio of the Company as of the date of release would have been no more than the Release LTV; and
(b) all Security Interests over such Collateral securing any Secured Pari Passu Indebtedness, including the
Revolving Credit Facility, are also released;

(2) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to a Person that is not the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary (but excluding (i) any transaction subject to “Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of
_Assets” and (ii) any Permitted Asset Swap entered into by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary with an_
Unrestricted Subsidiary); provided that any proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied as set forth

212


-----

under the second paragraph of the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets
_and Equity Interests in Restricted Subsidiaries”;_

(3) to the extent that such Collateral is disposed of pursuant to an enforcement of the Security Interests over such
Collateral under the applicable Security Document(s) in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement;

(4) to the extent that such Collateral is the property, asset or Capital Stock of a Guarantor, such Guarantor is
released from its Notes Guarantee as described under clause (1) of “—Release of Notes Guarantees”;

(5) (a) such Collateral is Property Collateral and such Property Collateral is held by or contributed to a Wholly
Owned Restricted Subsidiary which is concurrently designated as a Property Company and whose Capital Stock
or other ownership interest is concurrently pledged as a first-priority lien to secure the Notes and the Notes
Guarantees, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, as additional Share Collateral; provided that to the extent
such Property Collateral is held by a Dutch Entity, the Capital Stock or other ownership interest of Dutch
Holdco is also pledged on a first-priority basis to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement, as additional Share Collateral or (b) such Collateral is Share Collateral in respect of a
Property Company and such Property Company concurrently grants first-priority mortgages over all or
substantially all of the real estate assets owned by such Property Company to secure the Notes and the Notes
Guarantees, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, as additional Property Collateral;

(6) as described under (i) “—Amendments, Supplements and Waivers” or (ii) the second paragraph under “Certain
_Covenants—Liens” so long as immediately after the release there is no other Indebtedness secured by a Lien on_
the property or assets that was the subject of the Initial Lien that would result in the requirement for the Notes to
be secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, such Lien; or

(7) in connection with a transaction permitted by the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Merger,
_Consolidation or Sale of Assets, ” including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Permitted Reorganization and the_
Mexican Reorganization.

The Security Agent will take all reasonable action required to effectuate any release of Security Interests over
the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees (if applicable), in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall
be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless
action is required by it to effect such release).

**_Intercreditor Agreement_**

On the Issue Date, the Trustee shall become a party to the Intercreditor Agreement, as described under
“Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”. The Security Documents and the Collateral
will be administered by the Security Agent pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of the Trustee and the
holders of the Notes, the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain future Indebtedness of the Company
and its Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred and secured pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, recoveries received upon enforcement of the Security Interests over
the Collateral will be applied (subject to certain claims of the Trustee, the Security Agent and costs and expenses related
to the enforcement of the Collateral) pro rata in repayment of liabilities in respect of (i) obligations under the Indenture,
the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, (ii) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the guarantees of obligations
under the Revolving Credit Facility, and (iii) any other Indebtedness of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries
permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Trustee, the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and the other secured parties under the
Intercreditor Agreement have, and by accepting a Note, each holder of a Note will be deemed to have, irrevocably
appointed BNP Paribas Trust Corporation UK Limited, as Security Agent to act as its security agent under the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes, the Indenture, including the Notes Guarantees, and the Security Documents
(together, the “Finance Documents”). The Trustee, the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and the other
secured parties under the Intercreditor Agreement will have, and by accepting a Note, each holder of a Note will be
deemed to have, irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and
discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or the other Finance Documents, together
with any incidental rights, power and discretions.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Company will issue €400,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Notes on the Issue Date. The Notes will
mature on, 2026.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and will be payable semi-annually in arrears
on and of each year, commencing on, 2021. The Company will make each
interest payment to the holders of record of the Notes on the immediately preceding Business Day. The reimbursement
price of the Notes at maturity will be 100% of the principal amount then outstanding.

Interest on the Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the
date on which it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve
30-day months.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

The Company will pay all principal, interest, premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as
defined below) at the corporate trust office or agency of the Paying Agent (as defined below). The Paying Agent will, in
turn, make such payments to Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in
accordance with their customary procedures.

Payments of principal of, and premium, if any, on each Note in definitive registered form (“Definitive
_Registered Notes”) will be made by transfer on the due date to an account maintained by the payee pursuant to details_
provided by the holder against presentation and surrender (or, in the case of partial payment only, endorsement) of the
relevant Definitive Registered Note at the office of any Paying Agent. Payments of interest in respect of each Definitive
Registered Note will be made by transfer on the due date to an account maintained by the payee (the holder and account
details of which appear on the register of holders at the close of business on the relevant record date). Payments in
respect of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on Definitive Registered Notes are subject in all cases to any tax or
other laws and regulations applicable in the place of payment but without prejudice to the provisions under the headings
“—Optional Tax Redemption” and “—Additional Amounts”. Definitive Registered Notes, if issued, will only be issued in
registered form.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Company will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) and a transfer agent (the
“Transfer Agent”) for the Notes. The initial Paying Agent and Transfer Agent is BNP Paribas Securities Services,
Luxembourg Branch. The Transfer Agent is responsible for, among other things, facilitating any transfers or exchanges
of beneficial interests in different global notes between holders.

The Company also will maintain one or more registrars (each a “Registrar”). The initial Registrar will be
Paribas Securities Services, Luxembourg Branch. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of
Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time and will make payments on Definitive Registered Notes on
behalf of the Company.

The Company may change the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar without prior notice to the
holders. Notice of any change of Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar may be published on the official website of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu), to the extent and in the manner required by the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

**Form of Notes and Minimum Denomination**

The Notes will be initially issued in the form of global notes (the “Global Notes”) in registered form and will be
issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000. The Notes will be
serially numbered. In no event will Definitive Registered Notes in bearer form be issued. See “Book-entry, delivery and
_form”._

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Company or any Guarantor (each a “Payor”) on the Notes or under or
with respect to any Notes Guarantee will be made without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or
future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, assessments or similar governmental charges (including penalties, additions to tax,

214


-----

and interest related thereto) (“Taxes”) unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any
deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) Spain or any political subdivision or governmental authority of any thereof or therein having power to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized or otherwise considered to be a resident or doing
business for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the
power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction from or through which payment on the Notes or a Note Guarantee is made by or on behalf
of a Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax
(each of clause (1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required from any payments made with respect to the Notes or any Notes Guarantee,
including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium (if any), the Payor will pay (together
with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the
net amounts received in respect of such payments by each beneficial owner of the Notes or the Notes Guarantee,
as the case may be, after such withholding or deduction by any applicable withholding agent (including any
such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), equal the amounts which would have been
received in respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that
no such Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection
between the relevant holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,
member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant
holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and
the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including any Tax imposed as a result of a holder or beneficial owner being a
citizen or resident or national or domiciliary of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent
establishment in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction), other than a connection resulting from the mere acquisition,
ownership or disposition of such Note or enforcement of rights under or in respect of such Note or any Notes
Guarantee or the receipt of payments under or in respect of such Note or any Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed if the holder or the beneficial owner of a Note had made a
declaration of non-residence (including the delivery of a certificate of tax residency issued by the relevant tax
authorities) or any other claim or filing for exemption to which it is entitled (provided that (x) such declaration
of non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption is required by applicable law, regulation, administrative
practice or treaty of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from the requirement to
deduct or withhold all or a part of such Taxes and (y) at least 30 days prior to the first payment date with respect
to which such declaration of non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption is required under the
applicable law of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, the relevant holder at that time has been notified (in
accordance with the procedures set forth in “—Selection and Notice”) by the Payor or any other Person through
whom payment may be made that a declaration of non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption is
required to be made), but, in each case, only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to
make such declaration or other claim or filing;

(3) any Note presented for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is
first made available for payment to the holder or beneficial owner (except to the extent that the holder would
have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented during such 30-day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by withholding or deduction from payments under or with respect to
the Notes or any Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment to a holder or beneficial owner of Notes or Notes
Guarantees in respect of which the Company or any Guarantor have not received such information as may be
necessary to allow payments on such Note to be made free and clear of Spanish withholding tax or deduction on
account of Taxes, including but not limited to a duly executed and completed Payment Statement from the
Paying Agent, as may be required in order to comply with the procedures that may be implemented to comply
with the First Additional Provision of Law 10/2014, Royal Decree 1065/2007 of July 21, as amended by Royal
Decree 1145/2011, of July 29 and any implementing legislation or regulation thereof;

215


-----

(7) any Taxes imposed on, or on a third party on behalf of, a Spanish- resident legal entity subject to Spanish
Corporate Income Tax if the Spanish tax authorities determine that the Notes do not comply with exemption
requirements specified in the ruling of the General Directorate of Taxation (Dirección General de Tributos)
dated July 27, 2004, and require a withholding to be made;

(8) any Taxes withheld or deducted pursuant to an agreement described in Section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or otherwise imposed pursuant to Section 1471 through 1474
of the Code (including any amended or successor version of such Sections), any regulations, official
interpretations with respect to such Sections, or any intergovernmental agreements entered into in connection
with the implementation of such Sections or any law, regulation or other official guidance enacted by any other
jurisdiction relating to such intergovernmental agreement; or

(9) any combination of (1) through (8) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to any holder who is a fiduciary
or a partnership or other than the beneficial owner of such Notes to the extent that the beneficiary or settlor with respect
to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such Notes would not have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

The applicable withholding agent will (i) make any required withholding or deduction required by applicable
law and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld in accordance with applicable law of the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any
Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such copies
to the Trustee (or a holder upon request). If copies of such tax receipts are not obtainable, the relevant Payor shall provide
the Trustee (or a holder upon written request) other evidence of payment reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (or such
holder). Copies of such documentation will be available for inspection during ordinary business hours at the office of the
Trustee by the holders of the Notes upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent
located in Luxembourg if the Notes are then listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and traded on
the Euro MTF of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Notes
Guarantee is due and payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises shortly before or after the
30th day prior to such date, in which case it shall be promptly thereafter), if the Payor will be obligated to pay Additional
Amounts with respect to such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s
Certificate stating the fact that such Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable and will set forth such
other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay such Additional Amounts to holders on the payment date.
Each such Officer’s Certificate shall be relied upon until receipt of a further Officer’s Certificate addressing such matters.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes, any Notes Guarantee or this “Description of the Notes” there are
mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal (including any premium payable in respect of Notes, any redemption amount
and any other amounts in the nature of principal payable),

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes,

(3) interest, or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to the Notes or any Notes Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to
the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay (and indemnify the holder for) any present or future stamp, issue, registration, transfer, court
or documentary or similar Taxes or any other excise, property or similar Taxes which arise in any Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction in connection with the execution, issuance, delivery, enforcement or registration of any Notes, the Indenture,
any Notes Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to therein (other than on or in connection with a
transfer of the Notes following their initial resale by the initial purchaser thereof).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply
mutatis mutandis to any successor to a Payor and to any jurisdiction in which such successor is incorporated, organized,

216


-----

doing business or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which such
successor (or its paying agent) makes any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Notes Guarantee and, in
each case, any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax.

**Optional Redemption**

At any time prior to, 2023, at the option of the Company, the Company may, upon giving not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the holders of the Notes, on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40%
of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture at a redemption price of % of the
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, with the Net Cash Proceeds of one or
more Equity Offerings after the Issue Date; provided that:

(1) at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture remain outstanding
immediately after the occurrence of such redemption (excluding Notes held by the Company and its
Subsidiaries); and

(2) the redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

On or after, 2023, at the option of the Company, the Company may redeem all or a part of the
Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to holders of the Notes, at the redemption prices (expressed as
percentages of principal amount) set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes redeemed, to the
applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve month period beginning on October 1 of the years indicated
below:

**Year** **Percentage**

2023.........................................................................................................................................................................

2024.........................................................................................................................................................................

2025 and thereafter .................................................................................................................................................. 100.000%

Prior to, 2023, the Company may redeem during each twelve-month period commencing with the
Issue Date up to 10% of the original principal amount of the Notes at its option, upon not less than 10 nor more than
60 days’ notice to holders of the Notes, at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to the applicable redemption date.

In addition, the Company may on or prior to, 2023, upon giving not less than 10 nor more than
60 days’ notice to the holders of the Notes, at its option on one or more occasions redeem all or a portion of the Notes
(which includes Additional Notes, if any) at a redemption price equal to the sum of:

(1) 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus

(2) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, plus

(3) the Applicable Premium at the redemption date, subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on any interest payment date occurring on or prior to the redemption date.

Any redemption and notice of redemption may, at the Company’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one
or more conditions precedent (including, in the case of a redemption related to an Equity Offering, the consummation of
such Equity Offering).

**Tender Offers**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes (including, without limitation,
any Change of Control Offer and any Asset Disposition Offer), if holders of Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the
Company, or any third-party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Company, purchases all of the Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, all of the holders of the Notes will be deemed to have consented to such
tender or other offer and, accordingly, the Company or such third-party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the Notes
that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) following such purchase at a price equal to the price (excluding
any early tender fee) offered to each other holder of Notes in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the

217


-----

tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such
redemption date. In determining whether the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the thenoutstanding Notes have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn such Notes in a tender offer, Notes owned by the
Company or its Affiliates or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Company, or any successor thereof,
shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer.

**Mandatory Redemption**

The Company will not be required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes.

**Optional Tax Redemption**

The Company may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ notice to the holders of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”)
(subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date) and Additional Amounts, if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a
result of the redemption or otherwise, if the Company determines that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined above) which change or amendment is publicly announced and
becomes effective after the Issue Date (or, if a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, after such later date); or

(2) any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties,
regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction
or a change in published administrative practice) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, which change or amendment
is publicly announced and becomes effective after the Issue Date (or, if a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, after such later date);

(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”), the Company or any Guarantor is, or on
the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts, and such
obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to it (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
appointment of a new Paying Agent in accordance with the fourth paragraph under “—Paying Agent and Registrar for
_the Notes” or payment through a Guarantor)._

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“—Selection and Notice”. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than
90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Company or the applicable Guarantor would be obliged to pay Additional
Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in
effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the
Company will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Company is entitled to effect such
redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have
been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the Trustee to the effect that the
circumstances referred to above exist. The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient
evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be
conclusive and binding on the holders.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor to the Company.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

If a Change of Control occurs, each holder of Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all
or any part (equal to €100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder’s Notes pursuant to an
offer (a “Change of Control Offer”) on the terms set forth in the Indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, the Company
will offer a payment (a “Change of Control Payment”) in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes
repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased, to the date of purchase. Within 30 days
following any Change of Control, the Company will mail a notice to each holder describing the transaction or

218


-----

transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase Notes on the date (the “Change of Control
_Payment Date”) specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date_
such notice is mailed, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. The Company
will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations
thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes and the
related Notes Guarantees as a result of a Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of
Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent or tender agent for such Change of Control Offer, as applicable, an amount equal
to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate
stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by the Company.

The Paying Agent or tender agent for such change of control offer, as applicable, will promptly mail to each
holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly
authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to
any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each new Note will be in a principal amount of
€100,000 or, if greater, an integral multiple of €1,000.

The provisions described above that require the Company to make a Change of Control Offer following a
Change of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as
described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of
the Notes to require the Company to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar
transaction.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party
makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set
forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes properly
tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer. The Company also will not be required to make a
Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if it has theretofore issued a redemption notice in respect of all of
the Notes in the manner and in accordance with the provisions described under “—Optional Redemption” and thereafter
purchases all of the Notes pursuant to such notice.

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”,
there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes
to require the Company to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of
less than all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may
be uncertain. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a holder of Notes
may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

Subject to the covenants described below, the Company could enter into certain transactions, including
acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations which, though not constituting a Change of Control under the
Indenture, could increase the amount of outstanding debt or otherwise affect the Company’s capital structure or credit
ratings. In addition, we may not be able to finance the payments required for a Change of Control Offer. See “Risk
_factors—Risks relating to the Notes and our structure—We may not be able to raise the funds necessary to finance and_
_offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the_
_Indenture, and the change of control provisions contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in_
_the event of certain important corporate events”._

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, subject to any applicable requirements of any
clearing system then being used for the Notes, the Trustee will select Notes for redemption as follows:

(1) if the Notes are listed on any securities exchange, in compliance with the requirements, if any, of the principal
securities exchange on which the Notes are listed as certificated to the Trustee by the Company; or

(2) if the Notes are not listed on any national securities exchange, then in relation to the Notes, on a pro rata basis.

No Definitive Registered Notes may be redeemed in part such that the remainder of the Note is less than
€100,000 in aggregate principal amount. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least 10 but not more
than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that
redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with
a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

In addition, so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and traded on
the Euro MTF of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and its rules so require, all notices to holders of the Notes will also be
supplied to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and may be published at www.bourse.lu. If publication as provided above is
not practicable, notice will be given in such other manner, and shall be deemed to have been given on such date, as the
Trustee may approve. In the case of Definitive Registered Notes, notices will be mailed to holders of the Notes by first
class mail at their respective addresses as they appear on the records of the Registrar. If and so long as the Notes are
listed on any other securities exchange, notices will also be given in accordance with any applicable requirements of such
securities exchange. Notices given by publication will be deemed given on the first date on which publication is made.
Notices given by first class mail, postage paid, will be deemed given five calendar days after mailing whether or not the
addressee receives it.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion
of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed
portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the holder of Notes upon cancellation of the original Note and
will be collectible at the office of the Paying Agent. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for
redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for
redemption.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Company or any Guarantor for the payment of principal of, or interest, premium, or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes will become void unless presentation for payment is made as required in the
Indenture within a period of seven years, in the case of principal, or five years, in the case of interest, premium or
Additional Amounts, if any, from the applicable original payment date therefor.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Restricted Payments_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of the Company’s or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any payment in connection with any
merger or consolidation involving the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) or to the direct or indirect
holders of the Company’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests in their capacity as such (other
than (A) dividends or distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company
or in Subordinated Shareholder Funding, (B) dividends or distributions to the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries and (C) pro rata dividends or distributions made by a Subsidiary that is not a wholly owned
Subsidiary to minority stockholders (or owners of any equivalent interest in the case of a Subsidiary that is an
entity other than a corporation));

merger or consolidation involving the Company) any Equity Interests of the Company;

any Indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, except a
payment of interest or principal at the Stated Maturity thereof or (ii) make any cash interest payment or any
principal payment on, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Subordinated
Shareholder Funding; or

(4) make any Restricted Investment

(all such payments and other actions set forth in these clauses (1) through (4) being collectively referred to as
“Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment:

(1) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence of such
Restricted Payment;

(2) the Company would, after giving pro forma effect to such Restricted Payment (including the application thereof)
as if such Restricted Payment had been made at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, have been
permitted to incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness (other than Permitted Debt) pursuant to the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described below under the caption
“—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock”; and

(3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the Issue Date (excluding Restricted Payments permitted by
clauses (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (9) and (11) of the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum, without
duplication, of:

(a) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Company for the period (taken as one accounting period)
from the first day of the first full fiscal quarter immediately prior to the Issue Date to the end of the
Company’s most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at
the time of such Restricted Payment (or, if such aggregate Consolidated Net Income for such period is
a deficit, less 100% of such deficit; provided, however, that any deficit relating to any quarter ending
on or prior to March 31, 2022 shall be disregarded), plus

(b) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and Fair Market Value of property, assets or marketable
securities received by the Company since the Issue Date as a contribution to its common equity capital
or from the issue or sale of Equity Interests of the Company (in each case, other than Disqualified
Stock, Designated Preference Shares, Excluded Contributions or Capital Stock of the Company held by
the Company on or prior to the Issue Date) or Subordinated Shareholder Funding or from the issue or
sale of convertible or exchangeable Disqualified Stock or convertible or exchangeable debt securities
of the Company that have been converted into or exchanged for such Equity Interests (other than
Equity Interests (or Disqualified Stock or debt securities) sold to a Subsidiary of the Company or from
Excluded Contributions) or Subordinated Shareholder Funding, plus

(c) 100% of any dividends or distributions (including payments made in respect of loans or advances)
received by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date from an Unrestricted
Subsidiary or a Permitted Joint Venture, to the extent that such dividends or distributions were not
otherwise included in Consolidated Net Income of the Company for such period (and provided that
such dividends or distributions are not included in the calculation of that amount of Permitted
Investments permitted under clause (10) of the definition thereof), plus

(d) to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary after the Issue
Date, the Fair Market Value of the Company’s Investment in such Subsidiary as of the date of such
redesignation, plus

(e) to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made after the Issue Date is sold for cash or
otherwise liquidated or repaid for cash or Cash Equivalents (including, without limitation, any sale for
cash or other Cash Equivalents of an Equity Interest in an Unrestricted Subsidiary), the cash return of
capital with respect to such Restricted Investment (less the cost of disposition, if any).

The preceding provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, “Permitted Payments”):

221


-----

(1) the payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of declaration of the dividend, if at the date of
declaration the dividend payment would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture;

(2) the redemption, repurchase, retirement, defeasance or other acquisition of any Indebtedness of the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary or of any Equity Interests of the Company by conversion into (in the case of
Indebtedness) or in exchange for, or out of the Net Cash Proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale (other than
to a Subsidiary of the Company) of, Equity Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock),
Subordinated Shareholder Funding or from the substantially concurrent contribution of equity capital to the
Company; provided that the amount of any such Net Cash Proceeds that are utilized for any such redemption,
repurchase, retirement, defeasance or other acquisition will be excluded from clause (3)(b) of the preceding
paragraph;

(3) the defeasance, redemption, repurchase or other acquisition of subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or
any Guarantor with the Net Cash Proceeds from an incurrence of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect
of such subordinated Indebtedness;

(4) any Restricted Payment made by exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially current sale of, Equity
Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock), Subordinated Shareholder Funding or a substantially
concurrent cash capital contribution received by the Company from its shareholders; provided, however, that the
Net Cash Proceeds from such sale or cash capital contribution shall be excluded from clause (3)(b) of the
preceding paragraph;

(5) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition for value of Equity Interests of the Company or its Restricted
Subsidiaries representing fractional shares of such Equity Interests in connection with a merger, consolidation,
amalgamation or other combination of the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary;

(6) any other Restricted Payment; provided that the Leverage Ratio of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
on a pro forma basis after giving effect to any such Restricted Payment does not exceed 4.50 to 1.00;

(7) the purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition, cancellation or retirement for value, of
Capital Stock of the Company (including any options, warrants or other rights in respect thereof) (or payments
in lieu thereof), or payments to purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire, cancel or retire for
value Capital Stock of the Company (including any options, warrants or other rights in respect thereof), in each
case from or for Management Investors; provided that such payments, loans, advances, dividends or
distributions do not exceed an amount (net of repayments of any such loans or advances) equal to €4 million
_plus €2 million multiplied by the number of calendar years commenced since the Issue Date plus the Net Cash_
Proceeds received by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries since the Issue Date (including through receipt
of proceeds from the issuance or sale of its Capital Stock or Subordinated Shareholder Funding) from, or as a
contribution to the equity (in each case under this clause (7), other than through the issuance of Disqualified
Stock) of the Company from, the issuance or sale to Management Investors of Capital Stock (including any

been designated as Excluded Contributions and are not included in any calculation under clause (3)(b) of the
preceding paragraph;

Restricted Payments made pursuant to this clause (12) not to exceed €25 million (provided that if an Investment
is made pursuant to this clause in a Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary and such Person is subsequently
designated a Restricted Subsidiary, such Investment shall thereafter be deemed to have been made pursuant to
clause (3) of the definition of “Permitted Investments” and not this clause); and

222


-----

(13) the conversion of the Shareholder Loan into Equity Interests as described in this Offering Memorandum under
the caption “Summary―Recent Developments―Shareholder Loan”,

_provided, however, that after giving effect to any Restricted Payment referred to in clauses (6), (7), (8) or (12) of_
this paragraph, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence
thereof.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the Fair Market Value on the date of the
Restricted Payment of the assets or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or portion
thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in clauses (1) through (13)
of the second paragraph of this covenant, or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or one or
more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investment,” the Company will be entitled to classify such
Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on
circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in
any manner that complies with this covenant, including as an Investment pursuant to one or more clauses contained in the
definition of “Permitted Investment.”

**_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create,
incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect
to (collectively, “incur”) any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and the Company will not issue any Disqualified
Stock and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock; provided, however, that
the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary may incur Indebtedness, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may
incur Acquired Debt and the Company may issue Disqualified Stock and any Restricted Subsidiary may issue shares of
preferred stock, if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company’s most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for
which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness
is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is issued would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00, determined on a
pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had
been incurred or the Disqualified Stock or preferred stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such
four-quarter period; provided that a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that is not a Guarantor may incur Indebtedness
or issue Disqualified Stock or preferred stock pursuant to this paragraph solely to the extent that the Non-Guarantor
Leverage Ratio for the Company’s most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are
available immediately preceding the date on which such Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or preferred
stock is issued, as the case may be, would have been no greater than 1.00 to 1.00, as determined on a pro forma basis
(including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if such Indebtedness had been incurred or the
Disqualified Stock or preferred stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four quarter period.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence by the Company or its Restricted
Subsidiaries of any of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively, “Permitted Debt”):

(1) the incurrence by the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary of additional Indebtedness and letters of credit
under Credit Facilities (a) in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this clause (1)(a)
not to exceed €250 million plus an amount equal to 100% of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiary for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are
available immediately preceding the date on which such Indebtedness is incurred; and (b) pursuant to the
Bilateral Credit Facilities outstanding on the Issue Date and any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to
renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or disclose any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (1)(b);

(2) the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of the Existing Indebtedness;

(3) the incurrence (a) by the Company of Indebtedness represented by the Notes to be issued hereby (but not
including any Additional Notes), and (b) by the Guarantors and any future Guarantors of Indebtedness
represented by a Notes Guarantee (including Notes Guarantees of Additional Notes incurred in compliance with
the Indenture);

(4) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness represented by Capital
Lease Obligations, mortgage financings, sale and leaseback transactions or purchase money obligations, in each

223


-----

case, incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or cost of construction or
improvement of property, plant or equipment used in the business of the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary, in an aggregate principal amount, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to
renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (4), not
to exceed the greater of €65 million and 3.5% of Net Tangible Assets at any time outstanding;

(5) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in
exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to refund, refinance or replace Indebtedness (other than
intercompany Indebtedness) that was permitted by the Indenture to be incurred under the first paragraph of this
covenant or clauses (2) (other than the Indebtedness to be repaid from the proceeds of the Refinancing), (3), (5),
(15) or (17) of this paragraph;

(6) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of intercompany Indebtedness between or
among the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; provided, however, that:

(a) if the Company or any Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness and the creditor is not a
Guarantor, such Indebtedness must be unsecured and expressly subordinated to the prior payment in
full in cash of all Obligations with respect, in any bankruptcy, insolvency or winding up of such
obligor, to its Notes Guarantee, and

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such Indebtedness being
held by a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and (ii) any sale or other transfer
of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not either the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary will be
deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not permitted by this clause (6);

(7) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Hedging Obligations that are incurred for
the purpose of fixing or hedging interest rate risk or currency risk (i) with respect to any floating rate or

Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated to or pari passu with the Note or a Notes Guarantee, then the
guarantee must be expressly subordinated or pari passu, as applicable, to the same extent as the Indebtedness
being guaranteed;

(9) the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness in connection with one or more

borrowing of money or the obtaining of advances or credit;

with the sale or other disposition of any business, assets or Restricted Subsidiary, other than guarantees or
similar credit support by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness incurred by any Person

indirectly, contingent or otherwise, recourse to any property or assets of the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (other than the Receivables that are the subject of the factoring), or (b) if such Indebtedness has
recourse to any property or assets of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, only the portion of such
Indebtedness that is not recourse to any property or assets of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
(other than Receivables that are the subject of the factoring) may be considered as “Permitted Debt” under this
clause (13) and (ii) Indebtedness arising from Cash Management Services;

(14) the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of guarantees of Indebtedness of Permitted Joint
Ventures in an amount not to exceed €10 million;

accordance with the terms of the Indenture or (ii) incurred or issued to provide all or any portion of the funds
utilized to consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which a Person became a
Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or otherwise in
connection with or contemplation of such acquisition; provided that, with respect to each of clause (15)(i) and
(15)(ii), that after giving effect to such acquisition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation, transaction or other
combination, either:

(a) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary would be permitted to incur at least €1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first sentence, of this
covenant; or

(b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company is no less than immediately prior to such acquisition,
merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination;

(16) the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of additional Indebtedness (including Acquired
Debt) in an aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time outstanding, including all

to this clause (16), not to exceed €35 million; and

(17) the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding
principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness incurred

the Company from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of its Subordinated Shareholder
Funding or Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares or an Excluded
Contribution) or otherwise contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock,
Designated Preference Shares or an Excluded Contribution) of the Company, in each case, subsequent to the
Issue Date; provided, however, that (i) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be
excluded for purposes of making Restricted Payments under the first paragraph and clauses (2), (6) and (7) of
the third paragraph of the covenant described above under “—Restricted Payments” to the extent the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so
received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (17) to
the extent the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries makes a Restricted Payment under the first
paragraph and clauses (2), (6) and (7) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Restricted
_Payments” in reliance thereon; and_

(18) Indebtedness incurred under any Regulatory Debt Facility in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time
outstanding not exceeding €60 million;

To the extent any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor is a joint obligor with respect to any
Indebtedness, the entire amount of such Indebtedness shall be considered Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is
not a Guarantor for purposes of this covenant.

The accrual of interest, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any
Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, and the payment of dividends on Disqualified
Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of
Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant; provided that, in each such case, that the
amount thereof is included in Consolidated Interest Expense of the Company as accrued or paid in accordance with the
definition of such term.

225


-----

The incurrence by an Unrestricted Subsidiary of Non-Recourse Debt will not be deemed to be an incurrence of
Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant; provided that if at any time an
Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be
Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such
date under this covenant, then the Company shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness
meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (17) above, or is
entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company will be permitted to classify such
item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any
manner that complies with this covenant; provided that Indebtedness incurred under the Bilateral Credit Facilities
pursuant to clause (1)(b) of the second paragraph of this covenant may not be reclassified, and Indebtedness under the
Bilateral Credit Facilities outstanding or incurred on the Issue Date shall be deemed initially incurred on such date under
clause (1)(b) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant.

**_Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create,
incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien of any kind upon any of its assets or property (including Capital Stock of
Restricted Subsidiaries), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any
income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the
case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that
are not Permitted Liens if the Notes and the Indenture (or a Notes Guarantee in the case of Liens of a Guarantor) are
directly secured equally and ratably with, or senior in right of payment to, in the case of Liens with respect to
subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured,
and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged
upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—
_Release of Security Interests.”_

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or
permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary
to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or pay any
indebtedness owed to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(2) make loans or advances to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or

(3) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,

_provided that (x) the priority of any preferred stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the application
of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to other
Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an
encumbrance or restriction.

However, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason
of:

(1) agreements governing Existing Indebtedness, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Bilateral Credit Facilities as
in effect on or prior to the Issue Date and any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases,
supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the amendments,
modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacement or refinancings are no
more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those
contained in those agreements on or prior to the Issue Date;

226


-----

(2) the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents and any
notes and guarantees in connection with the subsequent issuance of debt securities in accordance with and on
terms no less onerous than the Indenture;

(3) applicable law or regulation or the terms of any license, authorization, concession or permit to engage in a
Permitted Business;

(4) any instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Stock of a Person acquired by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness or
Capital Stock was incurred in connection with or in contemplation of such acquisition), which encumbrance or
restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the
property or assets of the Person, so acquired; provided that, in the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was
permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be incurred;

(5) customary non-assignment provisions in leases entered into in the ordinary course of business and consistent
with past practices;

(6) purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business that impose restrictions on
that property of the nature described in clause (4) of the second paragraph of the covenant entitled “—
_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock”;_

(7) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of a Restricted Subsidiary that restricts distributions by that
Restricted Subsidiary pending its sale or other disposition;

(8) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements governing such
Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained
in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced;

(9) Liens securing Indebtedness otherwise permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the covenant entitled “—
_Liens” that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets subject to such Liens;_

(10) customary provisions in joint venture agreements, asset sale agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar
agreements;

(11) provisions that restrict in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset that
is subject to a lease, license or other contract entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(12) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under contracts entered into in the
ordinary course of business; and

(13) any agreement or instrument (A) relating to any Indebtedness or preferred stock of a Restricted Subsidiary
permitted to be incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under
“—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock” (i) if the encumbrances
and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable
to the holders of the Notes than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Notes and the Intercreditor
Agreement, together with the Security Documents associated therewith, as in effect on the Issue Date (as
determined in good faith by the Company) or (ii) if the encumbrances and restrictions are not materially more
disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes than is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good
faith by the Company) and either (x) the Company determines that such encumbrance or restriction will not
adversely affect the Company’s ability to make principal and interest payments on the Notes as and when they
come due or (y) such encumbrances and restrictions apply only during the continuance of a default in respect of
a payment or financial maintenance covenant relating to such Indebtedness, (B) constituting an intercreditor
agreement on terms substantially equivalent to the Intercreditor Agreement or (C) relating to any loan or
advance by the Company to a Restricted Subsidiary subsequent to the Issue Date; provided that with respect to
this clause (13) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a
whole are not materially less favorable to the holders of the Notes than the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in the Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement (as in effect on the Issue Date).

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_**

_The Company_

The Company will not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person; or (2) sell,
assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person; unless:

(1) either: (a) the Company is the surviving corporation; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation or merger (if other than the Company) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
other disposition has been made (the “Surviving Entity”) is a corporation organized or existing under the laws of
(i) Spain, (ii) any other member of the European Union that has adopted the euro as its national currency,
(iii) the United Kingdom or (iv) the United States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia;

(2) the Surviving Entity (if other than the Company) assumes all the obligations of Company under the Notes, the
Indenture, the applicable Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, pursuant to agreements satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction no Default or Event of Default exists or would exist;

(4) only in the case of a transaction involving the Company, the Company or the Surviving Entity, as the case may
be, will on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing
transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, either (a) be
permitted to incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set
forth in the first paragraph of the covenant entitled “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred
_Stock and Disqualified Stock” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company (or, if applicable, the_
Surviving Entity) would equal or exceed the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company immediately prior to
giving effect to such transaction; and

(5) the Company or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and
an Opinion of Counsel, in each case, stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and any supplemental
indenture comply with this covenant and the Indenture, and, if the Company is not the surviving entity, that the
accession agreement executed in connection therewith is the legally valid and binding obligation of the
Surviving Entity enforceable (subject to customary exceptions and exclusions) in accordance with their terms.

In addition, the Company may not, directly or indirectly, lease all or substantially all of its properties or assets,
in one or more related transactions, to any other Person.

Each holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have consented to and accepted and to have waived any
legal right to oppose, object to, or impose conditions on (including the provision of any guarantee or security), any direct
or indirect consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another Person or sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance
or other disposal of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken
as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person that, in any such case, complies with this covenant.

_The Guarantors_

A Guarantor may not sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, or consolidate with or
merge with or into (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving Person) another Person, other than the Company or
another Guarantor, unless:

(1) immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and

(2) either:

(a) the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving
any such consolidation or merger assumes all the obligations of that Guarantor under the Indenture and
its Notes Guarantee pursuant to a supplemental indenture satisfactory to the Trustee and the applicable
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(b) the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Indenture; or

228


-----

(c) in any transaction between (i) the Company or a Guarantor and (ii) a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor, the Company or such Guarantor is the surviving Person or the Restricted Subsidiary is the
surviving Person and assumes all of the obligations of the Company or such Guarantor under the
Indenture and its Notes Guarantee pursuant to a supplemental indenture satisfactory to the Trustee.

_General_

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this “—Merger and Consolidation or Sale of Assets”
covenant will not apply to (i) a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of assets between or among the
Company and any of the Guarantors, (ii) a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of assets of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor into the Company or a Guarantor or into another Restricted Subsidiary, (iii)
any transaction or arrangement that is a Permitted Reorganization or (iv) the Mexican Reorganization. Notwithstanding
clause (4) under “—Merger and Consolidation—The Company”, the Company or any Guarantor may merge with an
Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Company or such Guarantor in another jurisdiction to realize tax or
other benefits.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or
substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell,
lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter
into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the
benefit of, any Affiliate (each, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of
€5 million, unless:

(1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms no less favorable to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than
those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary
with an unrelated Person; and

(2) the Company delivers to the Trustee, with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate
Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of €15 million, a resolution of the Board of Directors
of the Company set forth in an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with
clause (1) above.

The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the
provisions of the prior paragraph:

(1) transactions between or among the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary (or any entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction) or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries;

(2) transactions with a Person (including any joint venture or equity investee) that is an Affiliate of the Company or
a Restricted Subsidiary solely because the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an Equity Interest in such
Person;

(3) payment of reasonable director’s and other fees to, indemnities provided on behalf of, and expenses (including
expense reimbursement, employee benefit and pension expenses) relating to, officers, directors, employees or
consultants of the Company or its Subsidiaries and payments of benefits and salaries to employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business;

(4) issuances or sales of Equity Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock) to Affiliates of the
Company or Subordinated Shareholder Funding; provided that the interest rate and other financial terms of such
Subordinated Shareholder Funding are approved by the Board of Directors of the Company in their reasonable
determination;

(5) Permitted Investments or Restricted Payments that are permitted by the covenant described above under the
caption “—Restricted Payments” (other than Permitted Investments described in clauses (3), (10), (11)(i) and
(14) of the definition of “Permitted Investments”);

229


-----

(6) transactions with lessors, customers, licensors, licensees, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or
services, in each case in the ordinary course of business, which are fair to the Company or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company,
or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an
unaffiliated party;

(7) the Refinancing and the conversion of the Shareholder Loan into Equity Interests as described in this Offering
Memorandum under the caption “Summary―Recent Developments―Shareholder Loan”;

(8) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under the
terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement
or instrument as in effect on the Issue Date, as such agreements and instruments may be amended, modified,
supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time to time after the Issue Date (to the extent not more
disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes in any material respect); and

(9) any Permitted Reorganization or the Mexican Reorganization.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Equity Interests in Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale
unless:

(1) the Company (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration (including by way of
relief from, or by any other Person (other than the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) assuming
responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair
Market Value of the assets or Capital Stock issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in
the form of cash or Cash Equivalents (except to the extent the Asset Sale is a Permitted Asset Swap). For
purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:

(a) any liabilities, as shown on the Company’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance sheet,
of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by
their terms subordinated to the Notes or any Notes Guarantee) that are assumed by the transferee of any
such assets pursuant to a customary novation agreement that releases the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary from further liability; and

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary
from such transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash within
180 days of the receipt thereof, to the extent of the cash received in that conversion.

Within 360 days after the receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Company may apply an
amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds, if any, at its option:

(1) (a) to repay, repurchase, prepay or redeem (including through open market purchases, voluntary tender offers or
privately negotiated transactions at market prices) (i) any Indebtedness incurred under clause (1) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and
_Disqualified Stock”; (ii) the Notes; (iii) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or_
Indebtedness which is secured by a Lien on assets that do not constitute Collateral (in each case other than
Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary); or (iv) Indebtedness of the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral, which Lien ranks pari passu with or senior to
the Liens securing the Notes and the applicable Notes Guarantees; or provided, however, that, in connection
with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness (other than the Notes or any revolving
Indebtedness (including, for the avoidance of doubt, under the Revolving Credit Facility), the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) to be
permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; or (b) unless
included in clause (a), to prepay, repay or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness and/or the COVID Related ICO
Facilities; provided that the Company shall redeem, repay or repurchase Pari Passu Indebtedness and/or the
COVID Related ICO Facilities pursuant to this clause (b) only if the Company makes (at such time or
subsequently in compliance with this covenant) an offer to the holders of the Notes to purchase their Notes in
accordance with the provision set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer for an aggregate principal amount of

230


-----

Notes at least equal to the proportion that (x) the total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding bears to
(y) the sum of the total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal
amount outstanding of such Pari Passu Indebtedness and/or the COVID Related ICO Facilities, as applicable;

(2) purchase Notes pursuant to an offer to all holders at a purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date);

(3) to acquire all or substantially all the assets of, or to acquire Capital Stock of, another Person engaged in a
Permitted Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, such Person is or becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) to make a capital expenditure;

(5) to acquire or invest in other long-term assets (other than Indebtedness or Capital Stock) that are used or useful in
a Permitted Business;

(6) to enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Cash Proceeds pursuant to clauses (3),(4) or (5) of this
paragraph; provided that such binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Cash
Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such acquisition or
expenditure is consummated and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 360 day
period; or

(7) any combination of the foregoing.

Pending the final application of any Net Cash Proceeds, the Company may temporarily reduce revolving credit
borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this covenant, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be
required to apply any Net Cash Proceeds in accordance with this covenant except to the extent that the aggregate Net
Cash Proceeds from all Asset Sales which is not applied in accordance with this covenant exceeds €20 million.

Any Net Cash Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph
will constitute “Excess Proceeds”. When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds €20 million, or at such earlier
time if the Company elects, the Company will make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all holders of Notes, and, to the
extent the Company elects, to repay, repurchase, prepay or redeem Pari Passu Indebtedness containing similar asset sale
provisions and the COVID Related ICO Facilities, to repay, repurchase, prepay or redeem the maximum principal
amount of Notes, such Pari Passu Indebtedness and COVID Related ICO Facilities, as applicable, that may be repaid,
repurchased, prepaid or redeemed out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to
100% of principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repayment or purchase, and will be payable in
cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Company may use those Excess
Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
surrendered in any Asset Sale Offer by holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness and COVID Related ICO Facilities, as
applicable, surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds
shall be allocated among the Notes on the one hand and Pari Passu Indebtedness and COVID Related ICO Facilities on
the other hand to be repaid, repurchased, prepaid or redeemed on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal
amount of tendered Notes, Pari Passu Indebtedness and COVID Related ICO Facilities, as applicable. Upon completion
of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each
repurchase of Notes and the related Notes Guarantees pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of
any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with
the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their respective obligations under
the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Board of Directors of the Company or, if required by applicable law, the shareholders of the Company may
designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a
Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding

231


-----

Investments owned by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be
an Investment made as of the time of such designation and will either reduce the amount available for Restricted
Payments under the covenant described above under “—Restricted Payments” or reduce the amount available for future
Investments under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as the Company shall determine. That
designation will only be permitted if such Investment would be permitted at that time and if such Restricted Subsidiary
otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Board of Directors of the Company or, if required by
applicable law, the shareholders of the Company may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted
Subsidiary if the redesignation would not cause a Default.

**_Additional Notes Guarantees and Collateral_**

The Company will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to guarantee the payment
of any other Credit Facilities or other Public Debt of the Company or any Guarantor unless such incurrence is permitted
by the covenant entitled “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock”, and
such Restricted Subsidiary (if not already a Guarantor) simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture
and accedes to the Intercreditor Agreement (or enters into an Additional Intercreditor Agreement) pursuant to which such
Restricted Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the Notes on the same terms and conditions as those set forth in the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and which Notes Guarantee will be
senior to or pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee of such other Credit Facilities or other Public Debt;
_provided that no such additional Notes Guarantee need be provided in respect of Credit Facilities or other Public Debt of_
the Company or any Guarantor (i) that does not exceed €25 million, in the aggregate with all other Credit Facilities or
other Public Debt described under this clause (i), (ii) if the guarantee of such Indebtedness is pursuant to a regulatory
requirement and such Credit Facilities or other Public Debt is owed to a regulatory body, or (iii) if such Credit Facilities
or other Public Debt is guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary on the Issue Date and such Restricted Subsidiary is not
a Guarantor.

The Company shall cause each Restricted Subsidiary that (i) becomes a Property Company or (ii) becomes an
obligor under the Revolving Credit Facility after the Issue Date to execute and deliver a supplemental indenture
providing for the Notes Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary on the same terms as the Notes Guarantees granted by
the other Guarantors pursuant to the Indenture as promptly as practicable following such Restricted Subsidiary becoming
a Property Company or an obligor under the Revolving Credit Facility, as the case may be.

The Company shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee the Notes to the extent that
such Notes Guarantee could reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in: (1) any violation of applicable law that
cannot be avoided or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably available to the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary; (2) any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary; (3) any cost,
expense, liability or obligation (including any Tax) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses and other than
reasonable governmental or regulatory filing fees and (4) a requirement under applicable law, rule or regulation to obtain
or prepare financial statements or financial information of such Person to be included in any required filing with a legal
or regulatory authority that the Company is not able to obtain or prepare through measures reasonably available to the
Company.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this covenant, any Notes Guarantee by a Restricted Subsidiary will
provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged when (i) the Indebtedness
that gave rise to the obligation to guarantee the Notes is discharged, (ii) in the case of any Notes Guarantee granted as
contemplated under the second paragraph of this covenant, when such Restricted Subsidiary ceases to be designated as a
Property Company or an obligor under the Revolving Credit Facility, as the case may be, or (iii) otherwise under the
circumstances described above under the caption “—The Notes Guarantees.” The terms, provisions and limitations
related to the Notes Guarantees will be included in the Indenture.

In addition, concurrently with the provision of any collateral under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Company or such Guarantor will provide
security to secure the Notes or such Notes Guarantee on a pari passu and pro rata basis. The Company shall pledge or
cause to be pledged as security to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Capital Stock of each Restricted Subsidiary that after the Issue Date becomes a Property Company as promptly as
practicable following such Restricted Subsidiary becoming a Property Company.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this covenant, this covenant shall not apply to: (1) the granting by
any Restricted Subsidiary of a Permitted Lien or Permitted Collateral Lien or (2) any guarantees incurred in connection
with Cash Management Services.

**_Impairment of Security Interests_**

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or omit to take any action that
would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that
the incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security
interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, and the Company shall
not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit
of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents, any interest
whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Permitted
Collateral Liens and the Collateral may be discharged, transferred or released in accordance with the Indenture, the
applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement; provided, however, that (a) nothing in this provision shall
restrict the release or replacement of any security interests in compliance with the terms of the Indenture as described
under “—Security—Release of Security Interests” and (b) any Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed,
restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or replaced, if contemporaneously with any such action, the Company
delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, from
an independent financial advisor confirming the solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or
replacement, (2) a certificate from an Officer of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the Person granting
such security interest after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or release and replacement, or (3) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the security so amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid Liens, in each case, not otherwise subject to
any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise
subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or
replacement. In the event that the Company complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee or the Security
Agent (as the case may be) shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to any such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement without the need for instructions
from the holders of the Notes.

**_Limitation on Activities of the Property Companies_**

Each of the Property Companies will not engage in any business activity or undertake any other activity, except
any activity (a) relating to the ownership of real estate and related property owned by each of them, (b) relating to the
provision of administrative, management and similar services and the ownership of assets necessary to provide such
services, (c) undertaken with the purpose of, directly related to or otherwise reasonably incidental to or resulting from the
establishment and maintenance of its corporate existence or (d) not specifically enumerated above that is immaterial or de
minimis in nature. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Property Company shall not (i) incur any financial Indebtedness
other than (x) the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Facility Agreement, the Bilateral Facility Agreement
and Hedging Obligations relating to the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and the COVID Related ICO Facilities,
(y) guarantees of the Term Facility Agreement and the Bilateral Facility Agreement or (z) guarantees of Secured Pari
Passu Indebtedness incurred by a Guarantor and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, or (ii) issue any Capital Stock (other than to the Company or a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary).

**_Lines of Business_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business other than a
Similar Business, except to such extent as would not be material to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole.

**_Suspension of Certain Covenants when Notes Rated Investment Grade_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, (1) the Notes are rated (a) BBB- or better by Fitch and (b) Baa3 or
better by Moody’s (or, if either Fitch or Moody’s ceases to rate the Notes for reasons outside of the control of the
Company, the equivalent investment grade credit rating from S&P or, in the absence of such, any other Nationally
Recognized Statistical Rating Organization selected by the Company as a replacement agency so that the Notes are so
rated by at least two such credit rating agencies); and (2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, then, beginning on that day and subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the covenants
specifically listed under the following captions in this Offering Memorandum will be suspended and, in each case, any
related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries:

233


-----

(1) “—Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock”;

(3) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries”;

(4) clause (4) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under the caption “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale
_of Assets—The Company”;_

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Equity Interests in Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(7) “—Additional Notes Guarantees and Collateral”; and

(8) “—Lines of Business”.

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Company’s Board of Directors may
not designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the covenant described below under the
caption “—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries” or the second paragraph of the definition of
“Unrestricted Subsidiary”.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the rating assigned by any such rating agency should subsequently decline to
below BBB− or Baa3, as applicable, the foregoing covenants and any related default provisions will be reinstituted as of
and from the date of such rating decline. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with respect to actions
properly taken during the period of suspension. Calculations under the reinstated “Restricted Payments” covenant will be
made as if the “Restricted Payments” covenant had been in effect since the Issue Date except that no default will be
deemed to have occurred by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended. On the rating
decline date, all Indebtedness incurred during the suspension period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue
Date, so that it is classified under clause (2) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Incurrence of
_Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock”._

**_Reports_**

The Company will post on its website and furnish to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Company’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31,
2021, annual reports containing a level of detail that is comparable in all material respects to this Offering
Memorandum consisting of the following information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company
as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and cash flow of
the Company for the two most recent fiscal years, including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements,
and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) pro forma income statement and
balance sheet information, together with summary explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions or
dispositions that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such
annual report relates or material recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently
completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates, in each case unless pro forma information has been
provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) (provided that a material acquisition, disposition or
recapitalization that has occurred fewer than 30 days prior to the last day of the completed fiscal year as to
which such annual report relates shall be reported in the next interim report provided pursuant to this covenant;
_provided, further, that such pro forma information will be provided only to the extent available without_
unreasonable expense); (c) to the extent relating to annual periods, an operating and financial review of the
audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations and material changes in liquidity
and capital resources; (d) a description of the business, management and shareholders of the Company, and a
description of all material debt instruments; and (e) material risk factors and material recent developments;

(2) within (a) 60 days following the end of the first and third fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Company
(beginning with the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2021) and (b) 75 days following the end of the
second fiscal quarter in each fiscal year of the Company (beginning with the fiscal quarter ending on June 30,
2021), quarterly financial statements containing the following information: (i) an unaudited condensed
consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash
flow for the most recent quarter year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and

234


-----

the comparable prior year periods; (ii) pro forma income statement and balance sheet information, together with
summary explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions or dispositions that have occurred since the
beginning of the most recently completed fiscal quarter as to which such quarterly report relates or material
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal quarter as to
which such quarterly report relates, in each case unless pro forma information has been provided in a previous
report pursuant to clause (3) below (provided that a material acquisition, disposition or recapitalization that has
occurred fewer than 30 days prior to the last day of the completed fiscal quarter as to which such quarterly
report relates shall be reported in the next interim report provided pursuant to this covenant; provided, further,
that such pro forma information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense);
(iii) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the results
of operations and material changes in liquidity and capital resources; and (iv) material recent developments and
any material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the most recent annual report;

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material acquisition, disposition, restructuring, senior management or board
of directors changes or change in auditors of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, a report containing a
description of such event; and

(4) promptly after the occurrence of any event that the Company announces publicly, a copy of such report or
announcement.

The Company will furnish to the Trustee within 180 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Annual Summary
Valuation Report with respect to the Collateral and may deliver any Interim Summary Valuation Report or Supplemental
Summary Valuation Report from time to time.

The foregoing reports and press releases that the Company shall deliver, provide or file in accordance with the
Indenture, shall be in English.

All financial statement and pro forma financial information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in
effect from time to time and on a consistent basis for the periods presented and the financial statements required under
clause (1) may be presented in the same format as in the Offering Memorandum; provided, however, that the reports set
forth in clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) above may, in the event of a change in applicable IFRS, present earlier periods on a
basis that applied to such periods.

No report need include separate financial statements or financial data for any Guarantors or non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries of the Company; provided that the annual report in clause (1) shall include a statement of the aggregate
percentage of the consolidated EBITDA of the Company represented by the Guarantors.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary
of the Company, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the preceding paragraph will include a
reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, and in the
operating and financial review of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the
Company.

In addition, so long as the Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Company is not
subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Company will
furnish to the holders, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the
Securities Act.

For so long as the equity securities of the Company or any Parent are listed on the regulated market of an
internationally recognized stock exchange and the Company or such Parent is subject to the reporting requirements
applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on such regulated market, the requirements of this covenant
shall be considered to have been fulfilled for all purposes if the Company or such Parent complies in all material respects
with the reporting requirements of such regulated market; provided, however, that the Company shall in any event
continue to comply with the second paragraph of this covenant.

**Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

At the request of the Company, in connection with the incurrence by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries
of any Indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral under the Indenture, the Company, the relevant Restricted

235


-----

Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly
authorized representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) on substantially the
same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the holders (provided that the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall have received an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to that effect));
_provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the_
Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as the case may be, under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

At the direction of the Company and without the consent of holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall
from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by
any such agreement that may be incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such
agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement the addition of
provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries
to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) secure the Notes (including Additional
Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes or other
Indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Indenture or (6) make any other change to any such agreement that does not
adversely affect the holders in any material respect (provided that the Trustee and the Security Agent shall have received
an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to that effect). The Company may only direct the Trustee and the
Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on
the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, adversely affect the rights,
duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee under the Indenture, any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

Each holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of
the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the
future pursuant to the provisions described herein).

**Financial Calculations**

When determining whether any transaction is permitted under the Indenture, the Company shall be permitted to
test it, at its option, (i) on the date binding documentation for such transaction is entered into, (ii) on the date that any
notice of any repayment, redemption, repurchase or refinancing of any Indebtedness is given to the holders thereof (if
applicable), or (iii) on the date such transaction is consummated. If the Company elects to test the transaction as
described in clauses (i) or (ii) above, the determination as to whether the transaction is permitted under the Indenture
shall be made assuming that the transaction and other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith were
consummated on the date binding documentation was entered into or such notice was given (each, an “Alternative
_Testing Date”), as applicable. If the transaction was permitted on the Alternative Testing Date chosen by the Company, it_
shall continue to be deemed so permitted under the Indenture even if it would have otherwise resulted in a Default or an
Event of Default on the date it is consummated. When determining whether any transaction is permitted under the
Indenture as of the Alternative Testing Date, the Company will make all necessary calculations as set forth under the
definitions of “Consolidated EBITDA”, “Leverage Ratio” and “Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio.”

If the Company has elected to test a transaction on an Alternative Testing Date (an “Alternative Testing Date
_Election”), the transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on such date for the purposes of making any other_
determination under the Indenture, until such time (the “Election Termination Time”) as (a) the transaction is definitively
terminated, cancelled or abandoned or (b) the Company has revoked its Alternative Testing Date Election and has instead
opted to test the transaction on the date it is consummated, which the Company will be entitled to do, irrevocably and
only once, at any time until the transaction is consummated. From the time the Company makes an Alternative Testing
Date Election to the related Election Termination Time, the provisions of the Indenture will apply assuming that the
relevant transaction was consummated on the Alternative Testing Date. No action properly taken by the Company or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries between an Alternative Testing Date Election and the related Election Termination Time
will constitute a Default or an Event of Default under the Indenture. In addition, the Indenture will permit, without
causing a Default or Event of Default, the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual
commitments undertaken during such period of time, so long as they were not undertaken in anticipation of the Election
Termination Time.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

Each of the following is an Event of Default:

236


-----

(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on, or Additional Amounts with respect to, the Notes;

(2) default in payment when due at maturity, upon redemption, upon repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise, of
the principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(3) failure by the Company or any of the Guarantors to comply with the provisions described under the caption “—
_Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”;_

(4) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for 30 days after written notice by the Trustee on
behalf of the holders or by the holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes to comply
with the provisions described under the captions “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders” and “—Certain
_Covenants” (in each case, other than a failure to purchase Notes which will constitute an Event of Default under_
clause (2) above and a failure to comply with the provisions described under the caption “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” described in clause (3) above);_

(5) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee on
behalf of the holders or by the holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes to comply
with any of the other agreements in the Indenture;

(6) default under any mortgage, Indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be
secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries)
whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, if that default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace period
provided in such Indebtedness on the date of such default (a “Payment Default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity;

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any
other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates €35 million or more;

(7) failure by the Company, or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together
(as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company) would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary, to pay final judgments (which are not covered by insurance as to which a claim has been submitted
and the insurer has not disclaimed or indicated an intent to disclaim responsibility for the payment thereof)
aggregating in excess of €35 million, which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of
60 days;

(8) except as permitted by the Indenture, any Notes Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company)
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the Notes shall be held in any judicial proceeding to be
unenforceable or invalid or shall cease for any reason to be in full force and effect or any Guarantor shall deny
or disaffirm in writing its obligations under its Notes Guarantee;

(9) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other
than in accordance with the relevant Security Documents, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to Collateral having a Fair Market Value in excess of
€35 million, for any reason other than satisfaction in full of all obligations of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries under the Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the Security
Documents, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or the
Indenture or any security interest created pursuant to the Indenture and the Security Documents shall be
declared invalid or unenforceable or the Company shall assent in writing that any such security interest is
invalid or unenforceable or any pledgor disaffirms in writing its obligations under the Security Documents and
any such Default continues for 10 days;

(10) default under any other Indebtedness that is secured by Collateral if such default results in the creditors under
such Indebtedness commencing an enforcement action of their security rights over the Collateral, with respect to
Collateral having a Fair Market Value in excess of €35 million; and

237


-----

(11) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Indenture with respect to the Company, any
Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as
of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company) would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary.

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to the
Company, any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately
without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at
least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable
immediately.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to certain
limitations, holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise
of any trust or power. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of
such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the holders within 60 days after being
notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on
any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith
determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the holders.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Trustee
may on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences
under the Indenture (except a continuing Default or Event of Default in respect of a covenant or provision of the
Indenture which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of holders holding not less than 90% of the then
outstanding amount of the Notes affected, in which case the consent of the holders of at least 90% shall be required, as
described under “Certain Covenants―Amendments, supplements and waivers”).

The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s
Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The
Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of
which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes
to take in respect thereof.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Company or any Guarantor, as such, will have
any liability for any obligations of the Company or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture or the Notes
Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder by
accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance
of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws of the United States,
and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The Company may, at its option, and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to
the outstanding Notes and all obligations of the Company and any Guarantors discharged with respect to their Notes
Guarantees (“Legal Defeasance”) except for:

(1) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest or
premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to
below;

(2) the Company’s obligations with respect to mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an
office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Company’s and any Guarantor’s
obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

238


-----

In addition, the Company may, at its option, and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Company and
any Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the Indenture (“Covenant Defeasance”)
and thereafter any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect
to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including non- payment, bankruptcy,
receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events) described under “—Events of Default and Remedies” will no longer
constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1) the Company must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated by
the Trustee for such purposes), in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, cash in euros, non- callable
European Government Obligations, or a combination of cash in euros and non-callable European Government
Obligations, in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of an internationally recognized firm of independent
public accountants, to pay the principal of, or interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the
outstanding Notes on the Stated Maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the
Company must specify whether the Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Trustee confirming that (a) the Company has received from, or there has been published by,
the United States Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the
applicable United States federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion
of Counsel will confirm that, the holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for
United States federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to United

income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and

Without the consent of holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of then outstanding Notes

principal amount, percentage or amount of premium or interest rate or to extend the maturity date of the Notes
or to amend the specified conditions or circumstances in which Additional Amounts are payable or the amount
of Additional Amounts that are payable and this subparagraph (6) shall not be construed as requiring the consent

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of Notes, the Company, the Trustee and the

Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;

from the currency of the initially issued Notes), or to add guarantees in favor of the Notes;

(5) to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant security interest in favor of the Security Agent to the extent necessary
to grant a security interest for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is
not prohibited by the Indenture and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of
_Security Interests” is complied with;_

240


-----

(6) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes Guarantees, the Security Documents or the Notes to any
provision of this “Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes”

Guarantees or the Notes;

(7) to add additional assets or property as Collateral;

(8) to evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee or Security Agent under the

Collateral and the Security Documents) with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination,
discharge or retaking is provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders or that does not adversely
affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such holder in any material respect.

Except as otherwise set forth herein, any amendments permitted by the Indenture need only be duly authorised
and executed by the Company, the Trustee and the Security Agent, if applicable, provided that, only the consent of the
Company, the Trustee and the relevant Notes Guarantor shall be required to give effect to any amendment or supplement
providing for Additional Notes Guarantees or security or modifying the terms of Notes Guarantees or security pursuant to
the immediately preceding paragraph.

Unless otherwise specified by the Company, a waiver authorized as described under this caption “Amendments,
_Supplements and Waivers” will become effective once the requisite consent of holders has been obtained, without_
execution of any supplemental indenture or other documentation. The consent of the holders is not necessary under the
Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the
substance of the proposed amendment. Consent by a holder to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture given in
connection with a tender of such holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued thereunder, when:

(1) either:

(a) all Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been replaced or
paid and Notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the
Company, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(b) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by
reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable within one
year and the Company or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the
Trustee (or another entity designated by the Trustee for such purposes) as trust funds in trust solely for
the benefit of the holders, cash in euros, non-callable European Government Obligations, or a
combination of cash in euros and non-callable European Government Obligations, in an aggregate
amount as will be sufficient without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge
the entire indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal,
premium, Additional Amounts, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption;

(2) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit or will occur as a
result of such deposit and such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under,
any other instrument to which the Company or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Company or any
Guarantor is bound;

(3) all sums payable by the Company or the Guarantors under the Indenture are paid or caused to be paid by or on
behalf of the Company or the Guarantors; and

241


-----

(4) the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited
money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Company must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel to the Trustee stating
that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

If requested in writing by the Company, which request may be included in the applicable notice of redemption
or pursuant to the applicable Officer’s Certificate, the Trustee or the Paying Agent (or such other entity directed,
designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee, for this purpose) shall distribute any amounts deposited to the holders
prior to the applicable redemption date or Stated Maturity, as applicable, of the Notes; provided that holders shall have
received at least three Business Days’ notice from the Company of such earlier repayment (which may be included in the
notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to holders prior to the applicable
redemption date or Stated Maturity, as applicable, of the Notes as set forth above will not include any negative interest,
present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts. To the extent the applicable series of Notes
are represented by a Global Note deposited with a common depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the
beneficial holders holding Book-Entry Interests as participants of such clearing system will be subject to the then
applicable procedures of such clearing system.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Trustee will be permitted to engage in transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must
eliminate such conflict within 90 days of becoming aware of such conflict or resign. If the Trustee becomes the owner or
pledgee of the Notes it may deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee, Paying
Agent, Registrar or such other agent.

The holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time,
method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain
exceptions. The Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be
required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own affairs. The
Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in the Indenture, and no
implied covenants or obligations can be read into the Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee will be under no
obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of Notes, unless such
holder has provided to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

**Judgment Currency**

Any payment on account of an amount that is payable in euros (the “Required Currency”) which is made to or
for the account of any holder of a Note in lawful currency of any other jurisdiction (the “Other Currency”) whether as a
result of any judgment or order or the enforcement thereof or the realization of any security or the liquidation of the
Company or any Guarantor shall constitute a discharge of Company’s or such Guarantor’s obligation under the
Indenture, the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, as the case may be, only to the extent of the amount of the Required
Currency which such holder could purchase in the New York foreign exchange markets with the amount of the Other
Currency in accordance with normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the first day (other than a
Saturday or Sunday) on which banks in New York are generally open for business following receipt of the payment first
referred to above. If the amount of the Required Currency that could be so purchased is less than the amount of the
Required Currency originally due to such holder, Company or such Guarantor, as the case may be, shall indemnify and
save harmless such holder from and against all loss or damage arising out of or as a result of such deficiency. This
indemnity shall constitute an obligation separate and independent from the other obligations contained in the Indenture,
the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective
of any indulgence granted by any holder of a Note from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect
notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or under any
judgment or order.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process**

The Indenture will provide that the Company and each Guarantor will appoint Jolly Hotels U.S.A., Inc. 2711
Centerville Road, Suite 400 Wilmington, Delaware 19808 USA as its agent for service of process in any suit, action or
proceeding with respect to the Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees brought in any federal or state court located
in the City of New York and will submit to such jurisdiction.

have occurred or are reasonably expected to occur in the good faith judgment of a responsible financial or accounting
officer of the Company. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the
interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of determination had been the

“Leverage Ratio” means, for any Person as of any date of determination, the ratio of (x) Indebtedness as of such
date to (y) the aggregate amount of Consolidated EBITDA for the period of the most recent four consecutive fiscal
quarters ending prior to the date of such determination for which consolidated financial statements of that Person are
available. In the event that the specified Person or any of its Subsidiaries incurs, assumes, guarantees, repays, repurchases
or redeems any Indebtedness (other than ordinary working capital borrowings) or issues, repurchases or redeems
preferred stock subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Leverage Ratio is being calculated and on
or prior to the date on which the event for which the calculation of the Leverage Ratio is being made occurs (the
“Leverage Ratio Calculation Date”), then the Leverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such
incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repayment, repurchase or redemption of Indebtedness, or such issuance, repurchase or
redemption of preferred stock, and the use of the proceeds therefrom as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable four-quarter reference period.

In addition, for purposes of calculating the Leverage Ratio:

(1) acquisitions that have been made by the specified Person or any of its Subsidiaries, including through mergers
or consolidations and including any related financing transactions, during the four-quarter reference period or
subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to the Leverage Ratio Calculation Date shall be given pro
forma effect as if they had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period and Consolidated
EBITDA for such reference period shall be calculated on a pro forma basis, but without giving effect to
clause (3) of the proviso set forth in the definition of Consolidated Net Income;

(2) the Consolidated EBITDA attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance with IFRS, and
hotels, properties, operations or businesses disposed of or the operations of which are substantially terminated
prior to the Leverage Ratio Calculation Date, shall be excluded; and

(3) the Consolidated Interest Expense attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance with
IFRS, and hotels, properties, operations or businesses disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, shall be
excluded, but only to the extent that the obligations giving rise to such Consolidated Interest Expense will not be
obligations of the specified Person or any of its Subsidiaries following the Calculation Date.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to an acquisition of assets, the amount
of income or earnings relating thereto and the amount of Consolidated Interest Expense associated with any Indebtedness
incurred in connection therewith, the pro forma calculations shall be determined in good faith by a responsible financial
or accounting officer of the Company and may include pro forma expenses and cost reductions and cost synergies that
have occurred or are reasonably expected to occur in the good faith judgment of a responsible financial or accounting
officer of the Company. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the
interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of determination had been the
applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligation applicable to such Indebtedness).
Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based on a prime or similar rate, a euro
interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen or, if none, then
based upon such optional rate chosen as the relevant Person may designate.

**Book-entry, delivery and form**

**General**

Notes sold within the United States to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A (the "Rule 144A Notes") under the U.S.
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (collectively, the "Rule 144A Global Notes"). The Rule 144A Global Notes will be deposited with, or on behalf
of, a common depositary (the "Common Depositary") for the accounts of Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of the
Euroclear system ("Euroclear"), and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme ("Clearstream") and registered in the name
of the Common Depositary or its nominee.

Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S (the "Regulation S Notes") under the U.S.
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (collectively, the "Regulation S Global Notes" and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the "Global
Notes"). The Regulation S Global Notes will be deposited with, or on behalf of, the Common Depositary for the accounts
of Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the Common Depositary.

Notes will be issued at the closing of this offering only against payment in immediately available funds.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the "Restricted Book-Entry Interests") and in the
Regulation S Global Notes (the "Regulation S Book-Entry Interests" and, together with the Restricted Book-Entry
Interests, the "Book-Entry Interests") will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or
persons that hold interests through such participants or otherwise in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions set
out in the Indenture and any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction.
Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers'
securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries. Except under the limited
circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical
delivery of certificated Notes.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained in
book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective participants. The Book-Entry Interests in the Global
Notes will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The
laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities
take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability
to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry
Interests will not be considered the owners or "holders" of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the Common Depositary (or its nominee), as applicable, will be
considered the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. In addition, participants in Euroclear
and/or Clearstream must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as the case may be, and indirect
participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through which they own
Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Trustee nor any of their respective agents and none of the Trustee, the
Registrar or the Transfer Agent will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the
Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their
respective nominee), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from
the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The Common Depositary will surrender such
Global Note to the Registrar for a cancellation or, in the case of a partial redemption, the Registrar will mark down,
endorse and return the applicable Global Note to reflect the reduction in the principal amount of such Global Note as a
result of such partial redemption. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry
Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the
redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that, under existing practices of
Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will
credit their respective participants' accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such
other basis as they deem fair and appropriate unless otherwise required by applicable law or applicable stock exchange or
depositary requirements; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 in principal amount may
be redeemed in part.

267


-----

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, interest and additional interest, if any) to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn, make such
payments to Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their
respective customary procedures. The Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices will
govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee and the relevant agents will treat the registered
holders of the Global Notes (i.e., the Common Depositary (or its nominee)) as the owners thereof for the purpose of
receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any of their respective
agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to,
or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing
the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments
made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

    - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

    - the records of the Common Depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participants.

**Currency of payment for the Global Notes**

Except as may otherwise be agreed between Euroclear and/or Clearstream and any holder, the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes will be paid to holders of
interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of the
applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor the Initial Purchasers nor any of
their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs,
losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any
such payment.

**Action by owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global
Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such
participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in
the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an
event of default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of such Notes, reserves
the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered Notes in certificated form (the "Definitive Registered
Notes"), and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear and
Clearstream's rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of a Note requires physical delivery of
Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in jurisdictions that require physical
delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes
in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures to be set
forth in the Indenture.

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective direct or indirect participants, which rules and procedures may change
from time to time.

268


-----

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in "Transfer restrictions". Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements as discussed in "Transfer
_restrictions"._

Transfers of Restricted Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Restricted Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the legend appearing on the face of the
Rule 144A Global Note, as set forth in "Transfer restrictions".

Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form to be provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act or any other exemption (if available) under the U.S. Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Restricted
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture)
to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a QIB within the
meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the
transfer restrictions described under "Transfer restrictions" and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any
other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Restricted
Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first
mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be
subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global
Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the
ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures, which rules and operating procedures
may change from time to time.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no
obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at
any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility
for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective
obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes if:

    - Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary for the Global Notes, and the Issuer fails to appoint a successor;

    - Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under the Indenture; or

    - the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through either
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the Indenture and
enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the Indenture.

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book- Entry Interest, its current procedure
is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry
Interests.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in
accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting

269


-----

the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend
set forth in "Transfer restrictions", unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Registrars and the Transfer
Agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will
be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration
from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a holding
of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be
issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance
of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no
Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000, in excess thereof,
will be issued. The Issuer will bear the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered
Notes. We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, holders of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or
Clearstream.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have
been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered to the
Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee or an authenticating agent will
authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee's and the Issuer's requirements are met. The Issuer or
the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond
sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and the Issuer to protect the Issuer, the Trustee or the Paying Agent
appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is
replaced. The Issuer may charge for the expenses of replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to
become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture, the Issuer in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase
such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book- Entry Interests in a Global Note only
in accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer
restrictions applicable to such Notes. See "Transfer restrictions".

So long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so
require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any issuance of Definitive Registered Notes in a newspaper having general
circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or to the extent and in the manner permitted
by such rules and regulations, post such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu). Payment of principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will
be payable at the office of the Paying Agent in Luxembourg so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require.

**Global clearance and settlement under the Book-Entry system**

**_Initial settlement_**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional euro bonds in registered form.
Book- Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the
business day following the settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**_Secondary market trading_**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day
funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any
Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser's and the seller's accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be
made on the desired value date.

**_Special timing considerations_**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for business.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions
involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to
transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may find
that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or Brussels
if Euroclear is used.

**_Clearing information_**

The Issuer expects that the Notes will be accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and
Clearstream. The international securities identification numbers, common codes and CUSIP numbers for the Notes are
set out under "Listing and general information".

**Information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

The following description of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream are provided solely as
a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement
systems and are subject to changes by them. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers take any responsibility for these
operations and procedures and the Issuer urges investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss
these matters.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream:

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the
accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the
safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear
and Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in several countries. Euroclear and Clearstream
participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and
certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers,
dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream
participant, either directly or indirectly.

Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account holders.
Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and
certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not
participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited
by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The Issuer understands that, under existing industry practices, if
either the Issuer or the Trustee requests any action by owners of Book-Entry Interests or if an owner of a Book-Entry
Interest desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the Indenture, Euroclear and
Clearstream would authorize participants owning the relevant Book-Entry Interest to give or take such action, and such
participants would authorize indirect participants to give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions
of such indirect participants.

The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.
Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial
interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global
Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Certain ERISA considerations**

**General**

The fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended, ("ERISA") imposes certain requirements on employee benefit plans subject to Title I of ERISA, on entities
that are deemed to hold the assets of such plans within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by
Section 3(42) of ERISA ("ERISA Plans") and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to any such ERISA
Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA's general fiduciary requirements, including, but not limited to,
the requirement of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan's investments be
made in accordance with the documents governing the plan.

The prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan (as well as
those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual
retirement accounts (together with ERISA Plans, "Plans") and certain persons (referred to as "parties in interest" or
"disqualified persons") having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is
applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited
transaction may be subject to excise taxes and/or other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

Any Plan fiduciary which proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its counsel
regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code to such an investment, and to confirm that such purchase and holding will not constitute or
result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA.

Non-U.S. plans, governmental plans and certain church plans (collectively referred to as "Non ERISA Plans"),
while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA
and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to non-U.S., state, local or other federal laws or regulations
that are substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA and the Code ("Similar Law"). Fiduciaries of any such
plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the Notes to determine the need for, and the availability, if
necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such law or regulations.

**Prohibited Transaction Exemptions**

The fiduciary of a Plan that proposes to purchase or hold any Notes should consider, among other things,
whether such purchase and holding may involve (i) the direct or indirect extension of credit to a party in interest or a
disqualified person, (ii) the sale or exchange of any property between a Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified
person, or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or disqualified person, of any Plan assets.
Depending on the satisfaction of certain conditions which may include the identity of the Plan fiduciary making the
decision to acquire or hold the Notes on behalf of a Plan, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the
Code or Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption ("PTCE") 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by a "qualified
professional asset manager"), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts),
PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by
insurance company general accounts) or PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions directed by an in-house asset manager)
(collectively, the "Class Exemptions") could provide an exemption from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA
and Section 4975 of the Code. Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application.
Fiduciaries of ERISA Plans considering acquiring and/or holdings the Notes in reliance on these or any other exemption
should carefully review the exemption to assure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that any of these Class
Exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes.

Accordingly, by acceptance of a Note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a Note will be deemed to
have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire or
hold the Notes (or any interest therein) constitutes assets of any Plan or Non-ERISA Plan or (ii) the acquisition and
holding of the Notes (or any interest therein) by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute or result in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any
applicable Similar Law.

**The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity**
**of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited**
**transactions, it is particularly important that each Plan fiduciary (and each fiduciary for non-U.S., governmental**
**or church plans subject to Similar Law) consult with its legal advisor concerning the potential consequences to the**
**plan under ERISA, the Code or such Similar Laws of an investment in the Notes.**

**Certain tax considerations**

The following is a general description of certain tax considerations relating to the acquisition, ownership and
disposal of the Notes. It does not constitute tax advice and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all tax
considerations relating to the Notes, as applicable, whether in Spain, the United States or elsewhere and does not purport
to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which might be subject to special
rules. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors as to the consequences under the tax laws of the
country of which they are resident for tax purposes and the tax laws of Spain of acquiring, holding and transfer of the
Notes and receiving payments of interest, principal and/or other amounts under the Notes. This summary is based upon
the law as in effect on the date of this Offering Memorandum and is subject to any change in law that may take effect
after such date.

Investors should also note that the appointment by an investor in Notes or any person through which an investor
holds Notes, of a custodian, collection agent or similar person in relation to such Notes in any jurisdiction may have tax
implications. Investors should consult their own tax advisors in relation to the tax consequences for them of any such
appointment.

**Spanish tax considerations**

The following summary describes the main Spanish tax implications related to the acquisition, holding and
transfer of the Notes by certain individuals or entities that are the beneficial owners of the Notes (for the purposes of this
section the "Noteholders") and payments made by the Issuer to the Noteholders.

The information provided below does not purport to be a complete analysis of the tax law and practice currently
applicable in Spain, and it is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice, and does not address
all the tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which (such as look-through entities, pension
funds, undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities or holders of the Notes by reason of employment)
may be subject to special rules. This analysis is a general description of the tax treatment under the Spanish legislation
currently in force in the common territory of Spain and, hence, it does not indicate the tax treatment applicable under the
regional tax regimes in the Historical Territories of the Basque Country and the Community of Navarre, or under the
provisions passed by Autonomous Communities which may apply to specific investors for specific taxes. References in
this section to holders include the beneficial owners of the Notes, where applicable.

The information provided below has been prepared in accordance with the following Spanish tax legislation in
force at the date of this Offering Memorandum:

(i) of general application, First Additional Provision of Law 10/2014, as well as Royal Decree 1065/2007, as
amended by Royal Decree 1145/2011, of July 29;

(ii) for individuals resident for tax purposes in Spain who are subject to the Individual Income Tax ("IIT"), Law
35/2006, of November 28, on the IIT Law and on the partial amendment of the Corporate Income Tax Law, the
Non-Resident Income Tax Law and the Net Wealth Tax Law, as amended, and Royal Decree 439/2007 of
March 30, promulgating the IIT Regulations, along with Law 19/1991, of June 6, on the Net Wealth Tax, as
amended, and Law 29/1987, of December 18, on Inheritance and Gift Tax ("IGT");

(iii) for legal entities resident for tax purposes in Spain which are subject to the Spanish Corporate Income Tax
("CIT"), Law 27/2014, of November 27, and Royal Decree 634/2015, July 10, promulgating the CIT
Regulations; and

(iv) for individuals and entities who are not resident for tax purposes in Spain which are subject to the Spanish
Non-Resident Income Tax ("NRIT"), Royal Legislative Decree 5/2004, of March 5, promulgating the
Consolidated Text of the NRIT Law, as amended, and Royal Decree 1776/2004, of July 30, promulgating the
NRIT Regulations, along with Law 19/1991, of June 6, on the Net Wealth Tax and Law 29/1987, of
December 18, on the IGT.

Whatever the nature and residence of the Noteholders, the acquisition, holding and transfer of Notes will be
exempt from indirect taxes in Spain (i.e., exempt from transfer tax and stamp duty, and exempt from value added tax, in
accordance with Article 314 of the Consolidated Text of the Spanish Securities Market Law and related provisions).

273


-----

**_Individuals with tax residency in Spain_**

_Individual Income Tax (Impuesto Sobre la Renta de las Personas Físicas)_

Both interest periodically received and income derived from the transfer, redemption or repayment of the Notes
constitute a return on investment obtained from the transfer of a person's own capital to third parties in accordance with
the provisions of Section 25.2 of the IIT Law, and must be included in the investor's IIT savings taxable base. The
savings taxable base is taxed at a flat rate of 19% for the first €6,000, 21% between €6,000.01 and €50,000, 23% between
€50,000.01 up to €200,000 or 26% for any amount in excess of €200,000.

Income from the transfer of Notes must be computed as the difference between the amounts obtained in the
transfer, redemption or reimbursement of the debt securities and their acquisition or subscription value. Costs and
expenses effectively borne on the acquisition and/or disposal of the Notes must be taken into account, insofar as
adequately evidenced, in calculating the income. When calculating the net income, expenses related to the management
and deposit of the debt securities will be deductible, excluding those pertaining to discretionary or individual portfolio
management.

No withholding on account of IIT will be imposed by the Issuer on interest as well as on income derived from
the redemption or repayment of the Notes by individual investors subject to IIT which is paid by the Issuer, provided that
certain requirements are met (including that the Paying Agent provides the Issuer, in a timely manner, with a duly
executed and completed Payment Statement). If those requirements are not met, such interest and income will be subject
to withholding on account of IIT at the applicable rate (currently 19%). See "—Compliance with certain requirements in
_connection with income payments."_

On the other hand, income derived from the transfer of the Notes may be subject, under certain circumstances,
to a withholding on account of IIT at the applicable rate (currently 19%). In any event, the individual holder may credit
any withholding on account of IIT against his or her final IIT liability for the relevant tax year.

_Reporting Obligations_

The Issuer will comply with the reporting obligations set forth in the Spanish tax laws with respect to
Noteholders who are individuals resident in Spain for tax purposes.

_Net Wealth Tax (Impuesto Sobre el Patrimonio)_

Individuals who are resident in Spain for tax purposes are subject to Spanish Net Wealth Tax (Spanish Law
19/1991), as amended, which imposes a tax on property and rights in excess of €700,000 held on the last day of any year.

Spanish tax resident individuals whose net worth is above €700,000 and who hold Notes on the last day of any
year would therefore be subject to Spanish Net Wealth Tax for such year at marginal rates varying between 0.2% and
3.5% of the average market value of the Notes during the last quarter of such year. However, this taxation may vary
depending on the legislation of the autonomous region of residency of the taxpayer. Accordingly, prospective noteholders
should consult their tax advisers.

_Inheritance and Gift Tax (Impuesto Sobre Sucesiones y Donaciones)_

Individuals who are resident in Spain for tax purposes who acquire ownership or other rights over any Notes by
inheritance, gift or legacy will be subject to Spanish IGT in accordance with the applicable Spanish regional and state
rules. The general applicable tax rates range between 7.65% and 81.6%, depending on various factors, such as the
amount of the gift or inheritance, the net wealth of the heir or beneficiary of the gift, and the kinship with the deceased or
the donor. Some tax benefits could reduce the effective tax rate. In addition, the final tax rate may vary depending also on
the legislation of the corresponding autonomous region. Prospective Noteholders should consult their tax advisers.

**_Legal entities with tax residency in Spain_**

_Corporate Income Tax (Impuesto Sobre Sociedades)_

Both interest periodically received and income derived from the transfer, redemption or repayment of the Notes
are subject to CIT (at a general flat tax rate of 25%) in accordance with the rules for such tax.

No withholding on account of CIT will be imposed on interest as well as on income derived from the
redemption or repayment of the Notes by Spanish CIT taxpayers which is paid by the Issuer, provided that certain

274


-----

requirements are met (including that the Paying Agent provides the Issuer, in a timely manner, with a duly executed and
completed Payment Statement). If those requirements are not met, such interest and income will be subject to
withholding on account of CIT at the applicable rate (currently 19%). See "—Compliance with certain requirements in
_connection with income payments."_

With regard to income derived from the transfer of the Notes, in accordance with article 61.s of the CIT
regulations, there is no obligation to withhold on income obtained by Spanish CIT taxpayers from financial assets traded
on organized markets in OECD countries. The Issuer intends to apply for the Notes to be listed on the official list of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the admission to trading of the Notes on the Euro MTF. Upon admission for trading on
the Euro MTF market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the Notes should fulfill the requirements set forth in the
legislation for exemption from withholding.

However the Directorate General for Taxation (Dirección General de Tributos), on July 27, 2004, issued a
ruling stating that in the case of issuances of debt securities by Spanish resident entities, as in the case of the Issuer,
application of the exemption requires that, in addition to being traded on an organized market in an OECD member state,
the placement of the Notes is made outside Spain and in another OECD member state. In the case of Notes held by a
Spanish resident entity and deposited with a Spanish based entity acting as depositary or custodian, income obtained
upon the transfer of the Notes may be subject to withholding tax at the current rate of 19% if the Notes do not comply
with exemption requirements specified in the above mentioned ruling issued by the Directorate General for Taxation
(Dirección General de Tributos). Prospective investors should seek advice from their tax advisors to check if they benefit
from this withholding exception in case of transfer of the Notes.

If the Notes are not listed on an organized market in an OECD member state, income derived from the transfer
of the Notes will be subject to withholding at the then applicable rate (currently 19%). In any event, a Spanish CIT
taxpayer that is a beneficial owner of the Notes may credit the withholding on account of CIT levied against its final CIT
liability for the relevant CIT year.

_Reporting Obligations_

The Issuer will comply with the reporting obligations set forth in the Spanish tax laws with Noteholders that are
legal persons or entities resident in Spain for tax purposes.

_Net Wealth Tax (Impuesto Sobre el Patrimonio)_

Spanish resident legal entities are not subject to Net Wealth Tax.

_Inheritance and Gift Tax (Impuesto Sobre Sucesiones y Donaciones)_

Legal entities resident in Spain for tax purposes that acquire ownership or other rights over the Notes by
inheritance, gift or legacy are not subject to the IGT but must include the market value of the Notes in their taxable
income for CIT purposes.

**_Individuals and legal entities that are not tax resident in Spain_**

_Non-Resident Income Tax (Impuesto Sobre la Renta de no Residentes)_

_(i)_ _Investors that are not resident in Spain for tax purposes, acting in respect of the Notes through a_
_permanent establishment in Spain for non-resident income tax purposes._

If the Notes form part of the assets affected to a permanent establishment in Spain of a person or legal entity that
is not resident in Spain for tax purposes, the tax rules applicable to income deriving from such Notes are, generally, the
same as those set forth above for Spanish CIT taxpayers. See "—Legal entities with tax residency in Spain—Corporate
_Income Tax (Impuesto sobre Sociedades)". Ownership of the Notes by investors who are not resident in Spain for tax_
purposes will not in itself create the existence of a permanent establishment in Spain.

The Issuer will comply with the reporting obligations set forth under Spanish tax laws with respect to
Noteholders that are individuals or legal entities not resident in Spain for tax purposes and that act with respect to the
Notes through a permanent establishment in Spain.

_(ii)_ _Investors that are not resident in Spain for tax purposes, not acting in respect of the Notes through a_
_permanent establishment in Spain for non-resident income tax purposes._

275


-----

Both interest payments periodically received under the Notes and income derived from the transfer, redemption
or repayment of the Notes, obtained by individuals or entities that are not resident in Spain for tax purposes and do not
act, with respect to the Notes, through a permanent establishment in Spain, are exempt from NRIT and therefore no
withholding on account of NRIT will be levied on such income provided certain requirements are met (including that the
Paying Agent provides the Issuer, in a timely manner, with a duly executed and completed Payment Statement, as set
forth in article 44.5 of Royal Decree 1065/2007 of July 27, 2007. See "—Compliance with Certain Requirements in
_Connection with Income Payments")._

If the Paying Agent fails or for any reason is unable to deliver a duly executed and completed Payment
Statement to the Issuer in a timely manner in respect of a payment of income under the Notes, the Issuer will apply
Spanish withholding tax at the applicable rate (currently 19%) on such payment of income on the Notes and the Issuer
will not pay additional amounts with respect to any such withholding tax. A Noteholder not resident in Spain for tax
purposes and entitled to exemption from NRIT, but to whom payment was not exempt from Spanish withholding tax due
to failure by the Paying Agent to deliver a duly executed and completed Payment Statement, will receive a refund of the
amount withheld, with no need for action on the beneficial owner's part, if the Paying Agent provides the Issuer with a
duly executed and completed Payment Statement no later than the 10th calendar day of the month immediately following
the relevant payment date.

In addition, Noteholders may apply directly to the Spanish tax authorities for any refund to which they may be
entitled, according to the procedures set forth in the NRIT Law. In such case, Noteholders may claim the amount
withheld from the Spanish Treasury from February 1 of the year immediately following the year in which the relevant
payment was made and within the first four years following the last day on which the Issuer may pay any amount so
withheld to the Spanish Treasury by filing with the Spanish tax authorities, among other documents (i) the relevant
Spanish tax form (currently tax form 210), (ii) proof of beneficial ownership, (iii) evidence that Spanish NRIT was
withheld and (iv) a certificate of residency issued by the tax authorities of the country of tax residence of such beneficial
owner, according to the procedures set forth in the NRIT Law and its regulations.

_Net Wealth Tax (Impuesto Sobre el Patrimonio)_

Individuals who are not tax resident in Spain are subject to Spanish Net Wealth Tax (Spanish Law 19/1991),
which imposes a tax on property and rights in excess of €700,000 that are located in Spain, or can be exercised within the
Spanish territory, as the case may be, on the last day of any year.

However, to the extent that the interest derived from the Notes is exempt from NRIT (as described under "—
_Individuals and Legal Entities that are not Tax Resident in Spain-Investors that are not Resident in Spain for Tax_
_Purposes, not acting in respect of the Notes through a Permanent Establishment in Spain Non-Resident Income Tax_
(Impuesto sobre la Renta de no Residentes)"), Noteholders not resident in Spain for tax purposes that hold Notes on the
last day of any year will be exempt from Spanish Net Wealth Tax regarding the holding of the Notes. Furthermore,
Noteholders who benefit from a treaty for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to wealth tax that provides for
taxation only in that Noteholder's country of residence will not be subject to Spanish Net Wealth Tax.

If the provisions of the foregoing paragraph do not apply, non-Spanish tax resident individuals whose net worth
related to property located, or rights that can be exercised, in Spain is above €700,000 and who hold Notes on the last day
of any year would therefore be subject to Spanish Net Wealth Tax for such year at marginal rates varying between 0.2%
and 3.5% of the average market value of the Notes during the last quarter of such year.

Individuals that are not resident in Spain for tax purposes who are resident in an EU or EEA Member State may
apply the rules approved by the autonomous region where the assets and rights with more value (i) are located, (ii) can be
exercised or (iii) must be fulfilled. As such, prospective Noteholders should consult their tax advisers.

Finally, legal entities who are not resident in Spain for tax purposes are not subject to Net Wealth Tax.

_Inheritance and Gift Tax (Impuesto Sobre Sucesiones y Donaciones)_

Individuals who are not resident in Spain for tax purposes who acquire ownership or other rights over the Notes
by inheritance, gift or legacy will be subject to IGT in accordance with the applicable Spanish state rules, unless they
reside in a country for tax purposes with which Spain has entered into a treaty for the avoidance of double taxation in
relation to IGT. In such case, the provisions of the relevant treaty for the avoidance of double taxation will apply.

If no treaty for the avoidance of double taxation in relation to IGT applies, applicable IGT rates would range
between 7.65% and 81.6%, depending on various factors, such as the amount of the gift or inheritance, the net wealth of
the heir or beneficiary of the gift, the kinship with the deceased or the donor and the qualification for tax benefits. These

276


-----

factors may vary depending on the application of the state's or the autonomous region's IGT laws. Generally,
non-Spanish tax resident individuals are subject to Spanish state rules. However, if the deceased, heir or the donee are
resident in an EU or EEA Member State, depending on the specific situation, the applicable rules will be those
corresponding to the relevant autonomous regions according to the law. Accordingly, prospective Noteholders should
consult their tax advisers.

Non-Spanish tax resident legal entities that acquire ownership or other rights over the Notes by inheritance, gift
or legacy are not subject to IGT. Such acquisitions will be subject to NRIT (as described above), without prejudice to the
provisions of any applicable treaty for the avoidance of double taxation entered into by Spain. In general, treaties for the
avoidance of double taxation provide for the taxation of this type of income in the country of tax residence of the
Noteholders.

**_Tax rules for Notes not listed on a regulated market, multilateral trading facility or other organized markets in an_**
**_OECD country_**

_Withholding on Account of NRIT_

If the Notes are not listed on a regulated market, multilateral trading facility or other organized markets on any
date on which income in respect of the Notes will be paid (i.e., a Payment Date or a redemption date), payments of
income to Noteholders in respect of the Notes will be subject to Spanish withholding tax at the then applicable rate
(currently 19%) except in the case of Noteholders that are: (a) residents of an EU Member State or an EEA Member State
with an effective exchange of tax information under the terms of Law 36/2006 of 29 November on measures for the
prevention of tax fraud other than Spain and obtain such income either directly or through a permanent establishment
located in another EU Member State or EEA Member State other than Spain, provided that such beneficial owners (i) do
not obtain such income on the Notes through a permanent establishment in Spain or in a country or jurisdiction outside
the EU or EEA and (ii) are not resident of, are not located in, nor obtain income through, a tax haven for Spanish
purposes (as currently defined by Royal Decree 1080/1991, of July 5, 1991, as amended); or (b) residents for tax
purposes in a country which has entered into a treaty for the avoidance of double taxation with Spain which provides for
an exemption from Spanish tax with respect to income payable in respect of the Notes to such Noteholders. Individuals
and entities that may benefit from exemptions or reduced tax rates should apply directly to the Spanish tax authorities for
any refund to which they may be entitled, following the Spanish tax authorities' procedures set forth in the relevant
Spanish legislation and regulations.

**_Compliance with certain requirements in connection with income payments_**

Provided the conditions set forth in First Additional Provision of Law 10/2014, in particular, that the Notes are
listed on a regulated market, multilateral trading facility or other organized markets and that the procedure provided in
Royal Decree 1065/2007 are met (including that the Paying Agent provides the Issuer, in a timely manner, with a duly
executed and completed Payment Statement) as explained below, income paid in respect of the Notes by the Issuer will
not be subject to Spanish withholding tax. For these purposes, "income" means interest and premium amounts paid on a
payment date or the amount of the difference, if any, between the aggregate redemption price paid upon the redemption
of the Notes (or a portion thereof) and the aggregate principal amount of such Notes.

In accordance with section 5 of Article 44 of Royal Decree 1065/2007, a duly executed and completed Payment
Statement must be submitted to the Issuer by the Paying Agent at the time of each relevant payment of income under the
Notes (i.e., a Payment Date or a redemption date including in respect of a change of control). In accordance with the form
attached as Annex to Royal Decree 1145/2011, the Payment Statement shall include the following information:

(i) the identification of the Notes with respect to which the relevant payment is made;

(ii) the income payment date (or redemption if the Notes are issued at discount or are segregated);

(iii) the total amount of income (or total amount to be reimbursed if the debt securities are issued at discount or are
segregated) to be paid on the relevant payment date; and

(iv) the total amount of income corresponding to Notes held through each clearing system located outside Spain
(such as Euroclear S.A./N.V. or Clearstream Banking, société anonyme).

In light of the above, the Issuer and the Paying Agent will enter into a paying agency agreement which, among
other things, will provide for the timely provision by the Paying Agent to the Issuer of a duly executed and completed
Payment Statement in connection with each income payment under the Notes and set forth certain procedures agreed by

277


-----

the Issuer and the Paying Agent which aim to facilitate such process, along with a form of the Payment Statement to be
used by the Paying Agent.

**Prospective Noteholders should note that neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers accept any**
**responsibility relating to the procedures established for the timely provision by the Paying Agent of a duly**
**executed and completed Payment Statement in connection with each payment of income under the Notes.**
**Accordingly, neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers will be liable for any damage or loss suffered by any**
**Noteholder who would otherwise be entitled to an exemption from Spanish withholding tax but whose income**
**payments are nonetheless paid net of Spanish withholding tax because these procedures prove ineffective.**
**Moreover, the Issuer will not pay any additional amounts with respect to any such withholding tax. See "Risk**
**_Factors—There are risks related to withholding tax in Spain, including in connection with the delivery of certain_**
**_documentation by the Paying Agent "._**

If the Paying Agent fails or for any reason is unable to deliver a duly executed and completed Payment
Statement to the Issuer in a timely manner in respect of a payment of income under the Notes, such payment will be
made net of Spanish withholding tax (currently 19%). If this were to occur, affected Noteholders will receive a refund of
the amount withheld, with no need for action on their part, if the Paying Agent submits a duly executed and completed
Payment Statement to the Issuer no later than the 10th calendar day of the month immediately following the relevant
Payment Date. If such was not the case, Noteholders may apply directly to the Spanish tax authorities for any refund to
which they may be entitled, according to the procedures set forth in the relevant Spanish legislation and regulations.

**Material U.S. federal income tax considerations**

The discussion below is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition,
ownership and disposition of Notes as of the date hereof. The following summary addresses only U.S. Holders (as
defined herein) who purchase the Notes at the "issue price" (the first price at which a substantial amount of Notes is sold
for money, excluding sales to underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) in the initial offering and hold the Notes as
capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. This summary does not address the tax consequences to
subsequent purchasers of the Notes.

As used herein, the term "U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or other entity treated as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state
thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of
its source or (iv) a trust (a) that is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and with respect to which one or
more U.S. persons has the authority to control all of the substantial decisions of the trust or (b) that has made a valid
election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations ("Treasury Regulations") to be treated as a U.S. person.

This summary is based upon provisions of the Code and Treasury Regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as
of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect), so as to result in U.S. federal
income tax consequences different from those summarized below. The discussion below does not cover all aspects of
U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any of the matters described herein will
have on, the acquisition, ownership or disposition of Notes by particular investors, nor does it address any tax
consequences arising under U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws or under the laws of any state, local, non-U.S. or other
taxing jurisdiction. In addition, this summary does not address tax consequences to U.S. Holders who may be subject to
special tax treatment, such as banks, dealers, traders that elect to mark the Notes to market, insurance companies,
financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, grantor trusts, investors liable for the
alternative minimum tax, U.S. expatriates, tax-exempt entities, persons holding the Notes as part of a hedge, straddle,

280


-----

conversion or other integrated financial transaction, accrual-method U.S. Holders who prepare an "applicable financial
statement" (as defined in Section 451 of the Code) or U.S. Holders whose "functional currency" is not the U.S. dollar. If
a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds the Notes, the tax
treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partner
of a partnership considering holding the Notes is urged to consult its own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income
tax consequences to it of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes by the partnership.

The summary of U.S. federal income tax consequences set out below is for general information only.
Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax
consequences to them of purchasing, owning or disposing of the Notes, as well as the consequences to them arising under
the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction or due to changes in tax law.

**_Payments of interest_**

_General_

Each payment of "qualified stated interest" (including any amounts withheld and any additional amounts paid in
respect of withholding taxes imposed on payments on the Notes) will generally be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary
income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder's method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. The term "qualified stated interest" generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable
in cash or in property, other than debt instruments of the Issuer, at least annually at a qualifying rate during the entire
term of the Note. The Issuer expects that stated interest on the Notes will be treated as qualified stated interest.

Interest paid by the Issuer on the Notes (including any additional amounts) generally will be considered income
from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered
passive category income. A U.S. Holder may be able to claim a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect
to the Notes where such U.S. Holder satisfies certain requirements, including a minimum holding period requirement
during which such holder is not protected from risk of loss. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors
concerning the applicability of the U.S. foreign tax credit and source of income rules to income attributable to the Notes.

_Euro-denominated stated interest_

The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder with respect to a payment of stated interest
denominated in euro will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment based upon the "spot rate" (as such term is
defined in Treasury Regulations) on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S.
dollars. A cash basis U.S. Holder generally will not recognize exchange gain or loss on the interest payment but may
recognize exchange gain or loss when it disposes of any euro it receives (as discussed below under "—Disposition of
_euro")._

An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to a payment of
stated interest denominated in euro in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of
income accrued will be based upon the average spot rate in effect during the interest accrual period or periods (or, in the
case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within each taxable year).
Under the second method, the accrual basis U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the
basis of the spot rate on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable
years, the spot rate on the last day of the portion of the accrual period within each taxable year). Additionally, if the
interest payment is actually paid or received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing
accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the day of actual
payment or receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder from year to year and
cannot be changed without the consent of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS").

Upon an accrual basis U.S. Holder's receipt of a stated interest payment denominated in euro (including a
payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a
Note), the U.S. Holder may recognize U.S.-source exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the
difference between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) and the
amount of such stated interest payment previously accrued (as described above), regardless of whether the payment is in
fact converted into U.S. dollars.

**_Disposition of Notes_**

On a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder will generally recognize
gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the amount realized on the disposition (less an amount equal to any

281


-----

accrued but unpaid qualified stated interest, which will be taxable as interest income to the extent not previously included
in income) and (ii) the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the Note. The amount realized by a U.S. Holder on a taxable
disposition of a Note for an amount in euro will be the U.S. dollar value of such euro on the date of the disposition (or on
the settlement date of the disposition, in the case of Notes traded on an established securities market and taxably disposed
of by a cash basis U.S. Holder or an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder). If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election
described in this paragraph, such election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and
cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

A U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally equal the "U.S. dollar cost" (as defined herein) of the
Note to such holder. The U.S. dollar cost of a Note purchased with euro will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the
purchase price on the date of purchase (or on the settlement date of the purchase, in the case of Notes traded on an
established securities market that are purchased by a cash basis U.S. Holder or an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder).

On a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder will recognize exchange
gain or loss that is generally equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note in
foreign currency determined as of (i) the date of disposition (or the settlement date, in the case of Notes traded on an
established securities market and taxably disposed of by a cash basis U.S. Holder or an electing accrual basis U.S.
Holder) and (ii) the date on which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note. The exchange gain or loss with respect to the
disposition of the Note will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by such the applicable U.S.
Holder on the disposition. Any such exchange gain or loss will be taxable as ordinary income or loss and generally will
be treated as U.S.-source for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. In the case of Notes traded on an established
securities market, a non-electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may also recognize exchange gain or loss upon a taxable
disposition of a Note for euro (or other non-U.S. dollar currency) if the relevant spot rate fluctuates between the date of
disposition and the date the U.S. Holder actually receives such euro (or other non-U.S. dollar currency).

Except as otherwise described in the immediately preceding paragraph, any gain or loss recognized by a U.S.
Holder in excess of exchange gain or loss on a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will
generally be treated as U.S.-source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of the
disposition, the Note was held by the U.S. Holder for more than one year. In the case of an individual U.S. Holder, any
long-term capital gain may be subject to preferential U.S. federal income tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is
subject to limitations. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors as to the foreign tax credit implications
of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes.

**_Disposition of euro_**

Euro received as interest on a Note or upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note
generally will have a tax basis equal to their U.S. dollar value at the time they are received. A U.S. Holder will generally
recognize gain or loss on a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the euro equal to the difference
between (i) the amount of U.S. dollars or the fair market value in U.S. dollars of other property received in such
disposition and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in such euro. Any gain or loss recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement
or other taxable disposition of the euro (including their use to purchase Notes or upon their exchange for U.S. dollars)
will be U.S.-source ordinary income or loss.

**_Reportable transactions_**

Under the Treasury Regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS including, in certain
circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note or foreign currency received in respect
of a Note, in each case to the extent that such disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. Prospective
investors should consult with their own tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to their
acquisition, holding or disposition of the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable
Transaction Disclosure Statement).

**_Backup withholding and information reporting_**

Information reporting requirements may apply to payments of principal and interest on, or the proceeds from a
sale of, a Note, unless the U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient, such as a corporation. Additionally, if a U.S. Holder fails to
provide its taxpayer identification number, or in the case of interest payments, fails either to report in full dividend and
interest income or to make certain certifications, it may be subject to backup withholding.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder's U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required information
is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding backup withholding
and information reporting requirements relating to their ownership of the Notes.

282


-----

**_Additional tax reporting requirements_**

Certain U.S. Holders are required to report information relating to interests in the Notes, subject to certain
exceptions (including an exception for Notes held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions), by attaching a
complete IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets) with their tax return for each year in which
they hold an interest in the Notes. Penalties may apply for failure to properly complete and file IRS Form 8938.
Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax own advisors regarding information reporting requirements relating to
their ownership of the Notes.

**_U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as "FATCA"), "foreign
financial institutions" and certain other foreign entities may be required to withhold U.S. tax on certain "foreign passthru
payments" (a term not yet defined) to the extent such payments are treated as attributable to U.S. source payments.

A number of jurisdictions (including the Kingdom of Spain) have entered into, or have agreed in substance to,
intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA ("IGAs"), which modify the way in which
FATCA applies in their jurisdictions. Under the provisions of IGAs as currently in effect, a foreign financial institution in
an IGA jurisdiction would generally not be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA from payments that it makes.
Certain aspects of the application of the FATCA provisions and IGAs to instruments such as the Notes, including
whether withholding would ever be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments
such as the Notes, are uncertain and may be subject to change. Notes issued on or prior to the date that is six months after
the date on which final regulations defining the term "foreign passthru payments" are filed with the U.S. Federal Register
generally would be "grandfathered" for purposes of FATCA withholding unless materially modified after such date.
Even if withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as
the Notes, under proposed regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments on Notes that are not otherwise
grandfathered would apply to passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication
in the Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments. Taxpayers generally may rely
on these proposed regulations until final regulations are issued.

Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding how these rules may apply to their
investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to
payments on the Notes, neither Issuer nor the Guarantors will be required to pay additional amounts as a result of the
withholding.

283


-----

**Plan of distribution**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") to be dated as
of the date of the final offering memorandum, the Initial Purchasers have severally agreed to purchase, and the Issuer has
agreed to sell to them, severally, the entire principal amount of the Notes as provided in the Purchase Agreement.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of
the Notes are subject to, among other customary closing conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After
the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial
Purchaser without notice.

The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with
the Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on
the cover page hereof.

Bankinter, S.A. is only participating in the Offering outside the United States under Regulation S of the
Securities Act. Bankinter, S.A. is not a registered broker-dealer registered with the SEC and will not be offering or
selling securities in the United States or to US nationals or residents.

CaixaBank is not a registered broker-dealer nor has an agreement with a registered broker dealer in place.
Therefore, CaixaBank will be participating in the Offering exclusively in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S.
Securities Act and will not offer the Notes to any U.S. Person.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial
Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed that, except with the prior written consent of the
Initial Purchasers, for a period of 90 days after the date of this Offering Memorandum neither the Issuer nor any of its
subsidiaries or other affiliates will offer, sell, contract to sell, issue or otherwise dispose of any secured debt securities
issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors and having tenor of more than one year (other than the Notes,
the Notes Guarantees and any unsecured debt securities, including convertible instruments).

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act and
may not be offered or sold within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons in
offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Any offer or sale of Notes in the United States in reliance on
Rule 144A will be made by broker-dealers who are registered as such under the U.S. Exchange Act. Any Initial
Purchaser that is not a broker-dealer registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will effect offers to
sell and sales of the Notes into the United States or to nationals or residents of the United States only through one or
more registered broker-dealers in compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations. One or more of the Initial
Purchaser may sell the Notes through affiliates or other appropriately licensed entities in jurisdictions in which they are
otherwise not licensed or authorized to make direct sales of the Notes. Until 40 days after the later of (i) the
commencement of this Offering and (ii) the issue date of the Notes, an offer or sale of the Notes initially sold in reliance
on Regulation S within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with
Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by
Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under "Transfer restrictions".

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

    - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of the FSMA received by it in connection with the issuance or sale of any Notes in
circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors; and

    - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by any of the
Issuer, the Notes Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession,

284


-----

circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer, the Notes Guarantors
or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or
sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in
connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance
with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not
constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would
be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about
and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the
Notes. See "Transfer restrictions".

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge
or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge,
contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbors
of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We have applied or will apply,
through our listing agent, to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to have the Notes
admitted to trading on the Euro MTF; however, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be admitted to trading or that
such admission to trading will be maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes after completing the
Offering. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making
activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any
such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or
that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See "Risk factors—
_Risks relating to the Notes and our structure—There is no existing public trading market for the Notes and the ability to_
_transfer them is limited, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes"._

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified
on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be four business days (as such term is used for purposes of
Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred
to as "T+4"). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle
in three business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish
to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum will be required, because the Notes initially will settle in
T+4, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of
the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty
bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the
Offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to
purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering
transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover
short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when
the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short
positions. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that
may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities
at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See "Risk
_factors—Risks relating to the Notes and our structure—There is no existing public trading market for the Notes and the_
_ability to transfer them is limited, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes"._

Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past, are
currently providing and may provide in the future, investment banking, consultancy, financial advisory, commercial
banking and cash management services to the Issuer and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they
have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may also receive
allocations of the Notes.

The proceeds from the Offering will be used to repay a portion of our indebtedness outstanding under the
Existing Senior Credit Facilities Agreement. The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are arrangers and lenders under the
Existing Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, and, in their capacities as lenders, will receive a portion of the proceeds
from the Offering. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in

285


-----

various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a
broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial
instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and
securities activities may involve securities and instruments of the Issuer or its affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their
respective affiliates have a lending relationship with the Issuer, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer
consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would
hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the
creation of short positions in the Issuer's securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short
positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their
affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of
such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short positions
in such securities and instruments.

**Transfer restrictions**

_Because of the following restrictions, you are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale,_
_pledge or other transfer of the Notes offered hereby._

**General**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or
any state securities laws and, therefore, the Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the
account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the Notes are only
to be offered and sold to:

(a) QIBs in compliance with Rule 144A; and

(b) non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions outside the United States in reliance upon Regulation S.

We use the terms "offshore transaction", "U.S. person" and "United States" with the meanings given to them in
Regulation S.

The Notes will be available initially only in Book-Entry form. The Notes will be issued in one or more Global
Notes bearing the legends set forth below.

(c) not a "qualified investor" as defined in the Prospectus Regulation.

(14) You understand and acknowledge that the Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available

purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a
customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA
to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined
in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU)
No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the "UK PRIIPs Regulation") for

prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor
in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests and certain**
**insolvency law considerations**

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations
on enforcement and may be limited under applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and
enforceability. The following is a summary description of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the
Notes Guarantees and Collateral, and a summary of certain insolvency law considerations in the jurisdictions in which
the Issuer, some of the Guarantors and some of the providers of Collateral are organized. In the event that any one or
more of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the providers of Collateral experience financial difficulties, it is not possible to
know with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced or
what the outcome of such proceedings would be. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the
obligations of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the providers of the Collateral and of the Notes Guarantees and the
Collateral themselves. The descriptions below are only a summary and do not purport to be complete or to discuss all of
the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the
Collateral. If additional Notes Guarantees and/or Collateral are required to be granted pursuant to the Indenture in the
future, such Notes Guarantees and/or Collateral will also be subject to limitations on enforceability and validity that may
differ from those discussed below. For further information regarding limitations on validity and enforceability of
guarantees and security interests see "Risk factors—Risks relating to the Notes and our structure—Your rights in the
_Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral" and "Risk factors—_
_Risks relating to the Notes and our structure—The enforcement of the Collateral may be restricted by Spanish law"_
above.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of Notes Guarantees granted by any Argentine subsidiaries**

**_New Civil and Commercial Code_**

Law 26,994 established a new Civil and Commercial Code (the "New Code") with an effective date of August 1,
2015. The New Code is a legal amalgamation in the path of the Italian Civil Code of 1942, since Argentina previously
had a Civil Code and a Commercial Code. Argentina is a Civil Law jurisdiction with almost all law established by code.
The Commercial and Civil Codes of Argentina, which were passed in 1859 and 1869, respectively, with subsequent
amendments over time, have been unified and simplified. Some of the provisions included in the New Code are
completely new; others codify existing jurisprudence.

Based on the contractual unification in the New Code, as of August 2015 there are no more "Civil" and
"Commercial" pledges, but rather "Common" pledges. The rules are basically the same but, before the New Code, if the
debtor defaults on a secured debt, the creditor would need to sell the pledged asset through a court auction but, in
principle, could not obtain ownership of the asset. In this regard, the New Code provides that, unless the debtor and
creditor agree on a special sale proceeding, the sale of the asset may be conducted through a public auction and the
creditor can get ownership of the asset if it has been agreed by the debtor and the creditor with a previous assessment of
an expert appointed by both parties. If the pledged asset consists of securities listed on a stock exchange, then the sale
may be conducted at the quotation price.

**_Personal guarantees_**

The Civil and the Commercial Codes as well as the New Code regulate the security agreement. The New Code
did not introduce major changes, particularly, considering that this type of guaranty is quite frequent and therefore the
provisions are based on common practice. The New Code states, coincidentally with the former Civil and Commercial
Codes, that there be a security agreement when a natural or a legal person assumes the secondary obligation, as security,
to comply an obligation of a third party in case of non-compliance. The obligation assumed by the guarantor shall be
equivalent or inferior to that of the main debtor, but in no case more onerous. If this rule is not followed the security
agreement will not be null but the reduction to the limits of the main obligation is authorized.

All current and future obligations may be secured and the guarantor may not avoid compliance based on the lack
of capacity of the debtor. The security must be granted in writing but it is not required to be implemented in a public
deed. Unless as otherwise agreed, the security includes the accessories to the main obligation and -as added by the New
Code- reasonable expenses required for collection, including legal costs.

While the former Commercial Code stated that in commercial security agreements the benefit of excussion and
division are not allowable, the New Code provides that creditor may collect from the guarantor after previous excussion
of the debtor's assets. If the debtor's assets only cover the debt partially, the creditor may direct the claim to the guarantor
for the outstanding debt. The benefit of excussion is removed in case of bankruptcy or preventive reorganization process

291


-----

as well as if the guarantor has renounced to such benefit, which is customary. The benefit of division, which can also be
renounced, applies if there is more than one guarantor, in which case each guarantor will respond for the share assumed
by each one.

The New Code also allows the guarantor to assume joint and several liability with the obligor or to act as
principal payor when that is provided in the agreement between the parties. The guarantor may raise its own exceptions
and defenses in addition to those of the principal debtor, even if the principal debtor has renounced to them. Once the
guarantor pays the obligation, it will subrogate over the creditors rights to get reimbursement from the main obligor.

The personal guarantees are extinguished: a) if for a fact attributed to the creditor the subrogation by the
guarantor of the rights over mortgages, pledges or other privileges accessory to the credit existing at the time of the
execution of the guarantee may not be effective; b) if the term for the compliance of the obligation is extended without
the consent of the guarantor; c) if five years have elapsed since the granting of the guarantee without the future obligation
being in place; and d) if the creditor does not initiate judicial action against the debtor within sixty days upon request of
the guarantor. Also, the guarantee is extinguished by the novation of the main obligation even if the creditor has reserved
its rights to keep action against the guarantor. The guarantee is not extinguished upon the novation resulting for the
reorganizational insolvency proceeding of the debtor.

**_Payments in foreign currency_**

The New Code also incorporated a provision (section 765) relating to foreign currency payment obligations by
establishing that foreign currency payment obligations may be discharged in Pesos. This amends the legal framework,
pursuant to which debtors could only discharge their foreign currency payment obligations by making payment in the
specific foreign currency agreed upon in their agreements. However, such provision seems to contradict section 766 of
the New Code stating that the debtor should deliver the corresponding amount in the designated specie (i.e., same
currency). Furthermore, there are other provisions underlining the principle of contractual freedom, except when there is
a public policy involved and therefore there have been several rulings stating that the parties may waive the right
provided under section 765 of the New Code. However, the option to waive the right to discharge in pesos a foreign
currency obligation by the debtor is still disputed by some rulings a few courts.

**_Trusts_**

Immovable and movable property trusts may be used to take security over most forms of movable and
immovable assets. Goods held in trust form a separate estate from the estates of the trustee and the settlor, and therefore
are not affected by any individual or joint actions brought by the trustee's or settlor's creditors, except in the case of fraud
by the settlor.

The beneficiary's creditors may exercise their rights over the proceeds of the goods held in trust and be
subrogated to the beneficiary's rights. The form of sale of the goods held in trust should be provided under the trust
agreement. Enforcement proceedings in trusts are generally faster and cheaper than those used to enforce a pledge or a
mortgage.

The formalities that must be complied with are those which relate to transferring the asset to the trust. This
depends on the type of asset, for example:

    - If the debt owed is assigned to the trust, the debtor must be notified of the assignment.

    - If real estate is transferred, the transfer must be instrumented by a public deed and be registered to
become perfected.

Therefore, the trust becomes binding as an agreement between the signatory parties as of the time of signature,
and vis-à-vis third parties when the formalities relate to those required for the transfer of the assets by the settlor to the
trust.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of Notes Guarantees granted by any Austrian subsidiaries**

**_Austrian statute of limitations in contract and in tort_**

The statute of limitations is generally 30 years for creditor claims for specific performance as well as damages
resulting from willful acts involving criminal behavior. For general tort claims, specifically with respect to damages
caused by negligence, the statute of limitations is three years from the date the creditor obtains adequate knowledge of

292


-----

both the occurrence of the tort (Schadenseintritt) as well as the identity of the tortfeasor. Adequate knowledge is assumed
if there are valid grounds to assume that a certain act triggered a certain detrimental consequence. A creditor must not
wait until there is a certainty of liability or of the identity of the tortfeasor to bring its claim.

The statute of limitations to file for rescission of an agreement is generally three years from the closing of the
relevant agreement, but when malice (Arglist) is involved, the statute of limitations to file for recission is 30 years.

The term "enforceable" means that a claim right or agreement is of a type and in a form enforced by Austrian
courts. This term does not mean that an obligation will be enforced in accordance with its terms in every circumstance in
Austria; in particular, specific performance may not always be available as a remedy. Generally, petitions for
enforcement of judgments in Austria are made through a district court, which issues enforcement orders that are carried
out, at times with some delay, by the court's bailiff.

**_Limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees_**

If a beneficiary under a guarantee claims that the guaranteed obligation has not been performed, the guarantor
would have to show that either there was performance of the guaranteed obligation or there was an apparent lack of any
guaranteed obligation in order to avoid liability under the guarantee. If the guarantor cannot clearly prove performance or
nonexistence of the guaranteed obligation, the court is likely to order the guarantor to perform under the guarantee. If the
existence of the guaranteed obligation is in doubt, the court will follow the principle "pay and reclaim" under which the
guarantor is required to perform under the guarantee but is able to recoup any payment made upon demonstration that
there was no guaranteed obligation. Such cases of "abusive drawdown" (rechtmissbräuchliche Inanspruchnahme) are
extremely rare.

Under the Notes Guarantees given by the Austrian Guarantor, such abuse of law would be assumed if

    - the beneficiaries of the Notes Guarantees approach the Austrian Guarantor for payment other than in
connection with the Notes or

    - the Notes Guarantees violate capital maintenance restrictions on guarantees provided as "upstream
security" (i.e., by an affiliate in favor of its parent or sister company).

**_Austrian capital maintenance rules_**

Guarantees benefitting a guarantor's parent or sister company are considered financial assistance and may
conflict with mandatory Austrian capital maintenance rules pursuant to Art 82 et seq. of the Act on Limited Liability
Companies ("GmbHG"). Violation of Austrian capital maintenance rules triggers the nullification (Nichtigkeit) of the
obligation in violation. As a rule, an affiliated enterprise may only guarantee, pledge, issue sureties or in any other way
financially support its (direct or indirect) parent or sister company to the extent (a) the affiliate consideration (äquivalente
_Gegenleistung) or, in case there is no adequate consideration (äquivalente Gegenleistung), such transaction would also_
have been concluded - at least at these conditions - with a non-shareholder (keine causa societatis) or (b) the transaction
is "commercially justified (betrieblich gerechtfertigt)", whereas, a transaction which puts the existence of the respective
affiliate at risk (existenzbedrohendes Risiko) can never be commercially justified.

A case generally accepted by Austrian legal scholars in which financial assistance shall be valid is an on-lending
scenario where a parent company obtains financing for its group companies and distributes the funds to subsidiaries
providing guarantees of the parent company's obligations under the financing arrangements. In a guarantee enforcement
case, an Austrian court would look at where the benefit lies and how it accrues.

Generally, a third-party guarantee beneficiary is not required to investigate capital maintenance aspects of the
corporate structure of the guarantor. However, in cases where a relationship exists between a group of companies and a
third party through which the third party may derive knowledge of the corporate structure of the guarantor and therefore
of an act of financial assistance, there is a duty to investigate. In cases "where the suspicion of an illicit financial
assistance is so strong that this suspicion closely resembles certainty", the Austrian Supreme Court has held that the
third-party guarantee beneficiary cannot rely on the guarantee issued in its favor unless the guarantee is given at an arm's
length and the guarantor receives a corporate benefit in return. Otherwise, payment under the guarantee can be made only
up to the guarantor's amount of freely distributable profits at the time a demand is made under the guarantee provided the
guarantor passes the necessary resolution on distribution of profits. The amount of a guarantor's distributable profits will
likely vary over time and could well be zero.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of Notes Guarantees and security interests granted by any Belgian**
**subsidiaries**

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

The grant of a guarantee or collateral by a Belgian company for the obligations of another group company must
fall within the grantor's legal and corporate purpose and be for the own corporate benefit of the granting company.

If the granting of a guarantee or the creation of a pledge does not fall within the grantor's corporate purpose, the
security could, upon certain conditions, be held null and void.

The assessment of whether or not the grant of a guarantee or collateral is in the Belgian Guarantor's corporate
interest, is largely dependent on factual considerations and is to be determined on a case-by-case basis by the directors of
the Belgian Guarantor and to be reviewed ultimately on a case- by-case basis by the competent courts. Consideration has
to be given to any actual or real benefit that the company would actually derive from the transaction and is particularly
relevant for upstream or cross-stream guarantees and security interests. It is generally taught by legal scholars at least the
following principles apply to such evaluation: (i) the risk taken by the Belgian Guarantor in issuing the guarantee must be
proportional to the direct and/or indirect benefit derived from the transaction, and (ii) the financial support granted by the
Belgian Guarantor should not exceed its financial capabilities. The responsibility for such assessment is that of the
directors of each Belgian Guarantor.

If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the company may be held liable (i) by the
company for negligence in the management of the company and (ii) by third parties in tort. Moreover, the guarantee or
collateral could be declared null and void and, under certain circumstances, the creditor that enforced the guarantee or the
collateral could be held on the basis of the principle of tort liability. Alternatively, the guarantee or collateral could be
reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate benefit or the creditor may be held liable for any guarantee amount
in excess of such amount. These rules have been seldom tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on
this issue.

In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee and collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or
indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is standard market
practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called "limitation language"
in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium.

**_Suspect Period and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event that bankruptcy proceedings are governed by Belgian law, certain business transactions shall be
declared ineffective against third parties if concluded or performed during a so-called "suspect period."

In principle, the cessation of payments (which constitutes one of the conditions for filing for bankruptcy) is
deemed to have occurred as of the date of the bankruptcy order. The court issuing the bankruptcy order may determine,
based on serious and objective grounds, that the cessation of payments occurred on an earlier date. Such date may not be
earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order, except in the case where the bankruptcy order relates to a
company that was dissolved more than six months before of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent
to defraud its creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may be determined as being the date of such
decision to dissolve the company. The period from the date of cessation of payments up to the declaration of bankruptcy
is referred to as the "suspect period" (période suspecte/verdachte periode).

The business transactions entered into during the suspect period which will be declared ineffective against third
parties include, among others, (i) gratuitous transactions or unbalanced transactions entered into on extremely beneficial
terms for the counterparty, (ii) payments for debts which are not due, (iii) payments other than in money for debts due,
and (iv) security provided for pre-existing debt.

The Belgian receiver of the Belgian Guarantor may also request the court to declare ineffective against third
parties payments of a Belgian Guarantor during the suspect period for due debts; provided that it can be proven that the
creditor concerned was aware of the cessation of payment of the company.

If the guarantee or security interest granted by the Belgian Guarantor or Belgian security provider were
successfully held ineffective (based on any of the above), noteholders would cease to have any claim in respect thereof
and would be under an obligation to repay any amounts received pursuant to such guarantee or the realization of the
security.

294


-----

Finally, regardless of any declaration by the commercial court of a suspect period, transactions of which it can
be demonstrated that they have been entered into with the fraudulent intention to cause prejudice to a third creditor, may
be declared ineffective against third parties, under certain circumstances.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of Notes Guarantees granted by any Chilean subsidiaries**

A party can bring a suit against a counterparty to a contract for breach of the counterparty's contractual
obligations as regulated by the Chilean Civil Code "CC" in articles 1545 to 1559. Potential remedies under Chilean laws
include specific performance, damages and rescission. In addition, a party may seek the nullification of a contract based
on lack of agreement as occurs in cases of mistake, duress or fraud, impossible performance as occurs in cases of sale of
non-existent goods or transactions prohibited by law, lack of real and licit cause as occurs in cases of simulated price or
compensation of criminal activities, lack of legal capacity by one of the parties or, more generally, lack of compliance
with a requirement or a formality established by law pertaining to the validity of the contract (CC art. 1467). If a contract
is rendered void and one of the parties to the voided contract has acted wrongfully, causing damage to a counterparty, the
injured party can sue for damages on tort grounds.

**_Statute of limitations_**

According to articles 2514 and 2515 of the CC, contract liability terminates upon the lapsing of 5 years from the
date that the obligation was due.

**_Security interests_**

Chilean law allows the creation of security interests over almost all kinds of assets and rights held by project
companies, except for certain assets listed in the Civil Procedure Code that may not be attached under Chilean law
(e.g., working tools and assets employed in services that may not be stopped without serious harm to public
transportation or health, household assets, salaries and child support). The main security interests over assets are obtained
in Chile through mortgages and pledges.

Chilean law allows for mortgages, which are granted over real estate, "regular pledges", under which possession
of pledged assets is vested in a creditor and "pledges without conveyance", under which collateral remains with the
pledgor. Regular pledges, including civil pledges and commercial pledges, are established over personal assets,
receivables, credits and shares, among others things.

**_Perfection and priority_**

Mortgages are perfected through notarial deeds registered in the Registry of Mortgages of the relevant real
estate registrar. Mortgages over major vessels or aircraft must be recorded in specific registrars.

Regular pledges are perfected by delivery of pledged assets to the notary. However, for commercial pledges to
be effective against third parties, they must be executed in a notarial deed or notarized private deed.

Under Law No. 20190, containing the Regulations on Pledges without Conveyance, which became fully
effective on January 2011, a pledge without conveyance may be perfected, proven and maintained through registration of
an instrument of public record or a certified copy of the private instrument in the Register of Pledges without
Conveyance (the "Registry"). Where a private instrument is used, the signatures on the document must be certified by a
notary public, and the document must be entered into the notary public's records. To successfully register a pledge, a
Chilean notary public must submit a certified copy of the pledge agreement, its amendment or release, to the Registry for
registration purposes within three days from the execution of the respective instrument of public record or from the date
of notarization of a private instrument. In general terms, for security interests that require registration, priority will be
given based on the "first registered, first-priority" principle, regardless of the date a security interest was created. If one
item is subject to several pledges or mortgages, each pledge will be given priority based on the chronological order of the
registry entries. According to Law No. 20190, the preference and assignment of real pledge rights may be made to the
extent the secured credit and the right to assign the pledge rights expressly appears in the Registry. Certain security
interests have statutory priority.

**_Enforcement of collateral_**

Under Chilean law, collateral foreclosure requires certain proceedings before a Chilean court. The relevant
obligations are paid with the proceeds of a sale of the collateral at a public action. If there are no bidders at the public

295


-----

auction, the assets may be awarded to the secured lender. No repossession of collateral is available. Security interests
created for project financing have different enforcement proceedings.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of Notes Guarantees granted by any Czech subsidiaries**

**_General limitations_**

Under Czech law, claims may become time-barred (three years being the general term) or may be or become
subject to the below described defenses.

The terms "enforceable", "enforceability", "valid", "legal", "binding" and "effective" (or any combination
thereof) mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type
enforced by Czech courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances
in accordance with their terms. The enforceability of any agreement or instrument may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, moratorium, misuse of rights and limitation laws of general application relating
to or affecting the rights of creditors, and claims may be or become subject to set-off, counterclaim or foreclosure of the
holder of such claim (in civil and administrative as well as tax matters).

The general defenses available to obligors under Czech law and in respect of the validity and enforceability of
contractual obligations are (a) modification of the enforceability of obligations on the grounds of the general obligation to
act in accordance with good manners (bonos mores), (b) modification of obligations on the grounds of exercise of rights
contrary to the principles of fair business dealings, (c) avoidance on grounds of error or fraud or duress, (d) force
_majeure, exceptio non adimpleti contractus (i.e., the right to suspend performance as long as the other party is in default_
in respect of its obligations) and (e) legal set-off.

In general terms, under Czech law, any guarantee must guarantee another obligation to which it is ancillary,
which must be clearly identified in the relevant guarantee or security agreement. Therefore, the guarantee or security
interest follows the underlying obligation in such a way that nullity of the underlying obligation entails nullity of the
guarantee or security and termination of the underlying obligation entails termination of the guarantee or security. In the
event that the guarantor is able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed obligations, Czech courts may
consider that the guarantor’s or security providers' obligations under the relevant guarantees or securities are not
enforceable.

Under Czech law, representatives of a company are not allowed to bind the company to performances which are
disproportionate to the assets of the Company, and this principle is also reflected in criminal law. Based on this concept,
it became customary to contractually limit guarantees by certain amounts which do not exceed the assets of the guarantor.

**_Insolvency_**

A legal act performed by a Guarantor may be contested as ineffective either (i) on the basis of general fraudulent
transfer provisions of the Czech Civil Code, as described in the section "—Fraudulent transfer provisions of general
_applicability including during bankruptcy" below or (ii) on the basis of provisions of the current Czech Act_
No. 182/2006, on Insolvency ("Czech Insolvency Act") as described in section "—Czech insolvency law" below. If a
legal act is declared ineffective, generally the beneficiary of such legal act shall surrender the benefit it obtained from
such legal act.

**_Financial assistance_**

Financial assistance is defined by the Czech Act No. 90/2012 Coll., on Business Corporations and Cooperatives
("Czech Companies Act") as a transaction where a company provides an advance payment, loan or a loan facility or
grants security, in each case for the purpose of acquisition of a participation interest in itself. Any legal act constituting
financial assistance is void and unenforceable and provision of the financial assistance is prohibited, unless it is
performed under conditions stipulated by the Czech Companies Act and the articles of association of the company. The
Czech Companies Act, among other things, requires that in relation to a limited liability company a financial assistance
may only be performed if (i) the transaction is made under equitable terms, (ii) it does not cause the company to become
insolvent, (iii) the statutory body of the company prepares a report giving the reasons for the financial assistance
(indicating risks and advantages for the company), stipulating the terms of the financial assistance and justifying why the
financial assistance is not in conflict with the company's interests and (iv) the general meeting of the company approves
the financial assistance.

296


-----

**_Guarantee Limitation_**

The obligations and liabilities of a Guarantor organized under the laws of the Czech Republic (a “Czech
**Guarantor”) under the Indenture shall be limited to an amount equal to the limitation amount (the “Czech Limitation**
**Amount”), being materially calculated as follows:**

Czech Limitation Amount = (G / O) * A

where:

“A” means the net book value of all assets of the relevant Czech Guarantor recorded in its latest annual
unconsolidated financial statements available to the Trustee or, if they are more up-to-date and supplied
to the Trustee within 15 Business Days of its request and if the Trustee has no reason to doubt the
accuracy thereof, its latest interim unconsolidated financial statements available to the Trustee;

“G” means the amount of all obligations that would have been guaranteed by the relevant Czech
Guarantor under the Indenture had the Czech Limitation Amount not been applied;

“O” means the total liabilities and equity (pasiva celkem) of the relevant Czech Guarantor recorded in
its latest annual unconsolidated financial statements available to the Trustee or, if they are more up-todate and supplied to the Trustee within 15 Business Days of its request and if the Trustee has no reason
to doubt the accuracy thereof, its latest interim unconsolidated financial statements. The term
“liabilities” shall have the meaning attached to it under the accounting standards applicable to the
relevant Czech Guarantor but, notwithstanding the foregoing, shall at all times:

(1) exclude financial obligations of the Czech Guarantor vis-à-vis any other member of the Group;

(2) exclude equity capital (vlastní kapitál) of the Czech Guarantor; and

(3) include the “G” amount calculated based on the definition set out above; and

(4) include all other liabilities guaranteed by (and other off-balance sheet liabilities of) the relevant
Czech Guarantor hereunder or otherwise.

For the avoidance of doubt, any identical obligations of the Czech Guarantor or any third party
mentioned in the previous sentence will only be included in the “O” amount once. The term “net book
value” used for the purpose of the calculation of the Czech Limitation Amount means the book value
reduced by corrections and provisions (in Czech opravné položky a oprávky (korekce)) as set out in
decree no. 500/2002 Coll., as amended (the “Decree”), implementing Act No. 563/1991 Coll., on
Accountancy, as amended or in any other legislation which may supersede the Decree in the future.

The obligations of any Czech Guarantor shall not include any liability or obligation if that would result
in the guarantee constituting unlawful financial assistance (including, without limitation, within the
meaning of sections 41 and 200 of the Act No. 90/2012 Coll., on Business Companies and
Cooperative, as amended).

**_Parallel debt_**

Generally, under Czech law a guarantee must be made in favor of a person who is the creditor of the claim that
the guarantee intends to secure. The beneficial holders of the Notes from time to time will not be party to the guarantees.
In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to have a secured claim, the documentation relating to the
Notes will provide for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the
holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The parallel debt procedure has not been
tested under Czech law, and there is no certainty that it would eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by
Czech law.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of Notes Guarantees granted by any French subsidiaries**

Under French law, claims may become time-barred (five years being the general term established for personal
claims and rights on movable property under Article 2224 of the French Civil Code (Code Civil)) or may be or become
subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim.

297


-----

The terms "enforceable", "enforceability", "valid", "legal", "binding", "effective" and any combination thereof
mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type enforced by
French courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances.
Enforcement before the courts will in any event be subject to:

    - the nature of the remedies available in the courts; and

    - the availability of defenses such as, without limitation, set-off, circumvention of law, abuse in the
exercise of rights, force majeure, duress and counterclaim.

Under French law, any guarantee, pledge or mortgage generally must guarantee or secure a primary obligation
to which it is ancillary. The primary obligation must be clearly identified in the guarantee or security agreement, and the
nullification or termination of the primary obligation entails the nullification or termination of the ancillary guarantee or
security. Consequently, if the primary obligation is deemed null and void, the ancillary guarantee or security interest will
also be deemed null and void. The same principles would apply to a French cautionnement but not to a garantie
_autonome, which is governed by Articles 2321 of the French Civil Code (Code Civil). A garantie autonome remains_
independent from the primary obligation and would not follow it, unless so provided by the parties to the garantie
_autonome._

Subject to the foregoing sentences relating to garanties autonomes, in the event that the security providers are
able to prove that there are no existing and valid secured obligations, French courts may consider that the security
providers' obligations under the relevant guarantees or securities are not enforceable.

The obligations under the Notes Guarantees granted by the Guarantors shall not extend to any use of the
proceeds of the Notes for the purpose of acquiring shares representing the share capital of such Guarantor or shares
representing the share capital of its holding company, or refinancing a previous debt incurred for the acquisition of shares
representing the share capital of such Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of its holding company.

Under French law, the granting of any security or guarantee by a company shall fall within its corporate purpose
and be in its corporate interest.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of Notes Guarantees granted by any German subsidiaries**

Under German law, claims may become barred under statutory limitation period rules (the general limitation
period being 3 years) and may be subject to defenses of set-off or counter-claims.

**_Limitations pursuant to German corporate law, particularly Sections 30 and 31 of the German Act on_**
**_Limited Liability Companies (GmbH-Gesetz)_**

Under German law, claims may become barred under statutory limitation period rules (the general limitation
period being 3 years) and may be subject to defenses of set-off or counter-claims.

**_Limitations pursuant to German corporate law, particularly Sections 30 and 31 of the German Act on_**
**_Limited Liability Companies (GmbH-Gesetz)_**

Certain Guarantors, namely NH Central Europe GmbH & Co. KG, NH Hotelbetriebs.-u. Dienstleistungs,
GmbH, NH Hoteles Deutschland GmbH, NH Hotelbetriebs-u Entwicklungs, GmbH and JOLLY HOTELS
DEUTSCHLAND GmbH are incorporated under the laws of Germany in the legal form of either a limited liability
company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) (“GmbH”) or a limited partnership with a general partner (persönlich
_haftender Gesellschafter), personally liable for the limited partnership’s debts without limitation, that is not a natural_
person but a GmbH (“GmbH & Co. KG”). The grant of guarantees or collateral by these types of companies is subject to
certain provisions of the German Act on Limited Liability Companies (GmbH-Gesetz).

As a general rule, Sections 30 and 31 of the GmbH-Gesetz prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its
affiliates to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) is
already less or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital). The granting of guarantees and
other security by a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or
affiliate thereof may be considered a disbursement pursuant to Sections 30 and 31 of the GmbH Gesetz. Therefore, in
order to enable German guarantors to issue guarantees to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company
without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements,
guarantees and other security documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to entities in the legal form

298


-----

of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the
creditors of such instruments agree, subject to certain exemptions, to enforce the guarantees or the collateral (or retain the
proceeds of an enforcement of the collateral) against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement does
not result in the GmbH’s or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, the general partner’s net assets falling below its stated share
capital or, as the case may be, if the net assets are already below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such
amount to be further reduced. Accordingly, the Notes Guarantees provided by the German Guarantors will contain such
limitation language and the respective Notes Guarantees will be limited in the manner described. This could lead to a
situation in which the Notes Guarantees provided by the German Guarantors cannot be enforced at all. Details of the
application of Sections 30 and 31 (or capital maintenance rules) are subject to evolving case law.

Furthermore, Section 15b para. 5 sentence 1 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) restricts
payments if and to the extent such payments under any Note Guarantee would deprive the German Guarantor of the
liquidity necessary to fulfill its financial liabilities to its creditors. These limitations could, to the extent applicable,
restrict the enforcement of the relevant Note Guarantee.

German capital maintenance rules and liquidity rules (including, without limitation, the prohibition to make
payments in case of existing illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit), over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or if such payments
cause illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit herbeiführen) and are regarded as being made to or for the benefit of an affiliate
pursuant to section Section 15b of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung)) are subject to ongoing court
decisions. Future court rulings may thus further limit the access of direct or indirect shareholders to assets of their
subsidiaries constituted in the form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of such
subsidiaries to make payments on the Notes Guarantees provided by the German Guarantors or of the beneficiaries of the
Notes Guarantees provided by the German Guarantors to enforce the Notes Guarantees provided by the German
Guarantors.

Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof)
regarding so-called destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives
a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied
by courts with respect to the enforcement of the Notes Guarantees provided by the German Guarantors. In such case, the
amount of proceeds to be realized may be reduced, even to zero.

In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing, funding to a debtor
and/or obtained security from the debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s impending
insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s impending insolvency at the time such funding was provided or
extended and/or such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that such
liability may arise if, for example, the creditor acted with the intent to detrimentally influence the position of the other
creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be
presumed if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor was close to
insolvency (Zusammenbruch) or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

**_Hardening periods and fraudulent transfer_**

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to a German Guarantor governed by the insolvency laws of
Germany, the Notes Guarantee provided by that Guarantor could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency
administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) or, in case debtor in possession status has been granted, the custodian (Sachwalter)
under the rules of contest (Insolvenzanfechtung) as set out in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). If the
validity or enforceability of a Notes Guarantee is contested successfully, beneficiaries of such Notes Guarantee may not
be able to recover any amounts under the respective Notes Guarantee. If payments have already been made under the
respective Notes Guarantee, the insolvency administrator may require that the recipients return the payment to the
insolvency estate, and the recipients would then have only general unsecured claims without preference in the insolvency
proceedings.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft), which includes the granting of a
guarantee, the provision of any other security and the repayment of debt, detrimental to the creditors of a debtor may be
contested according to the German Insolvency Code in the following cases:

    - any act granting a creditor, or enabling a creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) or
satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) can be contested if the transaction was effected (i) in the last three
months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor if at
the time of the transaction the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig), which means such debtor was
unable to pay its debts when due, and the creditor had knowledge thereof or knowledge of

299


-----

circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity or (ii) after a petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings had been filed against the debtor if the creditor had knowledge thereof or of the
debtor being illiquid or knowledge of circumstances imperatively suggesting such filing or illiquidity;

    - any act granting a creditor, or enabling a creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) or
satisfaction for a debt to which such creditor had no right, no right at the respective time or no right as
to the respective manner, can be contested if the transaction was effected in the month prior to the
filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor or at any time after
such filing; if the transaction was effected in the second and third month prior to the filing, it can be
contested if at the time of the transaction (i) the debtor was illiquid or (ii) the creditor knew that the
transaction would be detrimental to the creditors of the debtor (or had knowledge of circumstances
imperatively suggesting such detrimental effect);

    - any legal transaction effected by the debtor which is directly detrimental to the creditors of the debtor
or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim
against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable can be contested if the transaction was effected
(i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings
against the debtor if, at the time of the legal transaction, the debtor was insolvent and the other party to
the legal transaction had knowledge thereof or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings had been filed against the debtor if the other party to the legal transaction had knowledge
thereof or of the debtor being illiquid;

    - any act whereby a debtor grants security (including a guarantee) for a third-party debt and such security
is regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich) can be contested unless it was effected
earlier than four years prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against
the debtor;

    - any act performed by the debtor during a period of ten years prior to the filing of a petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor or at any time after such filing can be contested if
the debtor acted with the intent to disadvantage its creditors, and the beneficiary of the transaction had
knowledge of such intent at the time of the transaction, with such knowledge presumed if the
beneficiary knew that the debtor’s illiquidity was imminent and that the transaction disadvantaged the
debtor’s other creditors;

    - any non-gratuitous contract between the debtor and an affiliated party that directly operates to the
detriment of the debtor’s other creditors can be contested unless such contract was concluded earlier
than two years prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the
debtor or the affiliated party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as
of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party”
includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general
partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies
holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the
debtor and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the
foregoing persons;

    - any act that provides security or satisfaction for a claim of a shareholder for repayment of a shareholder
loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or an economically equivalent claim can be contested (i) in the event the
debtor provided security, if the transaction was effected within the last ten years prior to the filing of a
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor or thereafter or (ii) in the event
the debtor provided satisfaction, if the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor or thereafter; or

    - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a
third party can be contested if the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor or thereafter and a shareholder of
the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge), in which case the shareholder has
to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid, subject to further conditions.

For purposes of the above, the knowledge of circumstances from which an imperative conclusion regarding the
debtor’s insolvency or the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor can be drawn

300


-----

will be considered tantamount to actual knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency or the filing of a petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings against the debtor. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice
the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor’s impending illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s
creditors.

Under a special law regarding the temporary suspension of insolvency filing obligations ("COVInsAG"), to the
extent that the obligation of the management of a debtor to file for insolvency is or was suspended pursuant to the
specific requirements of the COVInsAG in the time period of 27 March 2020 to 30 April 2021, certain payments enjoy
privileges in respect of avoidance in case of a later insolvency. In particular, any repayment, on or before 30 September
2023, of loans granted within the suspension period and any grant of security to secure such loans is not deemed to be
prejudicial to the creditors, if and to the extent that, at the time of the grant of the loan or the relevant collateral, the
debtor’s obligation to file for insolvency was suspended.

Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator contesting transactions according to the German
Insolvency Code described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could also
contest any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right according to the German Act of
Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites are similar but vary to a certain
extent from the rules described above and the contest periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its
rights of contest in the courts.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of Notes Guarantees and security interests granted by any Italian**
**subsidiaries**

NH Italia S.p.A is incorporated under the laws of Italy (the “Italian Guarantor”) and is subject to Italian laws
governing creditors’ rights and bankruptcy and restructuring proceedings. Under Italian Law the guarantee obligations
under the Indenture of an Italian Guarantor are subject to compliance with, inter alia, the rules on corporate benefit,
corporate authorization and certain other Italian mandatory provisions. If a guarantee or a security interest is being
provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be
triggered.

An Italian company granting a guarantee must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee.
Such principle on corporate benefit applies equally to down-stream, cross-stream and up-stream guarantees issued by
Italian companies. While the existence of a corporate benefit in relation to a downstream guarantee is usually self-evident
(i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant guarantor), the
existence of a corporate benefit in relation to a cross-stream or an up-stream guarantee (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing
financial obligations of direct or indirect parent companies or sister companies of the relevant guarantor) may be
challenged unless it can be proved that the guarantor may derive some benefits or advantages from the granting of the
guarantee, therefore it should be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis (such as in the case of subsidiary guarantors
which are providing the Guarantees in connection with the Notes offered hereby). The concept of real and adequate
corporate benefit is not expressly defined in under Italian law and is assessed by and determined on a case- by-case basis,
further its existence is purely a business decision of the directors and the statutory auditors. As a general rule, corporate
benefit is assessed at the level of the relevant company on a standalone basis, although in certain circumstances, and
subject to specific rules, the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration.
In particular, in case of upstream and cross-stream guarantees for the financial obligations of group companies, examples
may include financial consideration in the form of a guarantee fee or access to cash flows in the form of intercompany
loans from other members of the Group, while transactions featuring debt financing of distributions to shareholders are
largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such
transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest.

The general rule is that the risk assumed by the Italian Guarantor must not be disproportionate to the direct or
indirect economic benefit to the guarantor. To this extent, customary “limitation language” is usually inserted in
indentures, credit agreements and guarantees for the purpose of limiting the amount guaranteed by the guarantor to an
amount that is proportionate for the direct or indirect economic benefit to the guarantor derived from the transaction.

In principle, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the guarantee or the collateral ultra vires and
potentially affected by conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors
may be subject matter of challenges and annulment.

Thus, civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of the guarantor if it is assessed that they did not act in the
best interest of the guarantor and that the acts they carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the guarantor or
were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil

301


-----

liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over the guarantor or having knowingly received
an advantage or profit from such improper control. However, no liability can be attributed where no prejudice or actual
damage is suffered by the Italian Guarantor because of the determination of the controlling shareholder as provided under
Article 2497 of the Italian Civil Code having regard to the overall result of the controlling activity. Moreover, the
guarantee could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the
third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interests of the guarantor.

The rules on corporate benefit apply equally to security provided by subsidiaries in relation to the financial
obligations of their parent or sister companies.

As to corporate authorizations and financial assistance, the granting of a guarantee or security by an Italian
company must be permitted by the articles of association (statuto) of the Italian company providing such guarantee. In
addition, the granting of a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability that would result in unlawful
financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code pursuant to
which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give financial assistance (whether by means of
loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) for the acquisition or subscription of its own shares or quotas by a third party or
those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company. Financial assistance for refinancing
indebtedness in originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or
indirect parent company would also be a violation. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these
provisions is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interest of the
company.

In the light of the above, in no event shall the obligations and liabilities of the Italian Guarantor under a
guarantee include the obligation to guarantee financial indebtedness which was incurred, in full or in part, to purchase the
shares of such Italian Guarantor (or of any of its direct or indirect holding company) and which would therefore
constitute the provision of financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 and/or 2474, as the case may be, of the
Italian Civil Code whereas, in the latter case, an authorization proceeding in the shareholders’ meeting is not
implemented. To this extent, the total value of the guarantee cannot exceed the profits and the distributable reserves as
resulting from the approved financial statements.

Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within
the meaning of Article 106 of the Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993 (the “Italian Banking Act”), whose
exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorised financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions
of the Italian Banking Act may, inter alia, cause the Guarantees to be considered null and void. In this respect, the
Ministerial Decree No. 53 of 2 April 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that
the issuance of guarantees or security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same
group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies
within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies, which are under the control of the
same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the Italian Guarantor and the guaranteed entity being part
of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity.

In addition, under Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a personal guarantee is issued to guarantee
conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be
expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate
document, such as the Indenture). It has been held, that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant
guarantor’s assets. It is uncertain, however, whether courts are entitled to debate and to rule over such determination.

Italian Law No. 108 of 7 March 1996, as amended, implemented or supplemented from time to time (the “Italian
_Usury Law”), prevents lenders from applying interests higher than certain rates, as set forth in accordance with the Italian_
Usury Law (the “Usury Rates”). In addition, even where the Usury Rates are not exceeded, the interest rate applicable
may be held usurious if: (i) it is considered to be disproportionate to the amount lent (taking into account the specific
circumstances of the transaction and the average rate applicable to similar transactions in the market) and (ii) the debtor
is deemed to have been in financial and economic difficulties at the time the indebtedness was incurred. In order to
comply with (i) the Italian Usury Law and Article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) the mandatory provisions of
Italian law in relation to capitalization of interests (including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code), the obligations of
any Italian Guarantor under a guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (x) Usury Rates and (y) any interest on
overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code,
respectively.

In any event, pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, a guarantee granted by an Italian Guarantor
must be capped to a maximum guaranteed amount.

302


-----

The guarantees created through pledges on unlisted securities cannot be immediately liquidated.

Under Article 2352 of the Italian Civil Code, in the case of a pledge on shares, the voting rights, unless agreed
otherwise, belong the holder of the pledge and in the case of capital increase pursuant to Article 2442 of the Italian Civil
Code, the pledge is extended to the newly issued shares.

**_Parallel Debt_**

There is no established concept of "trust" or "trustee" under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and
enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the holders of the Notes under
security interests on Italian assets is debatable under Italian law.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a "parallel debt". Pursuant to the parallel debt and
subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and to applicable law, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a
claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The Security Interests governed by Italian law will
also secure the parallel debt. The parallel debt procedure has not been tested in Italian courts, and there is no certainty
that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by Italian law.

It is uncertain and untested in Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security can be created and perfected in
favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) that are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents nor
are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries and,
therefore, the risk of unenforceability by the holders of the Notes of the Italian security documents posed by Italian law
cannot be eliminated or mitigated.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of Notes Guarantees granted by any Luxembourg subsidiaries**

**_Intra-group Guarantees_**

Entities incorporated in Luxembourg have granted guarantees in order to secure, inter alia, the obligations
under the Notes Guarantees.

The conditions to be satisfied by the granting of guarantees relate to (i) corporate power, (ii) corporate authority,
and (iii) corporate benefit. These rules are derived from general principles and must be applied to specific circumstances,
which have to be analyzed on a case by case basis. Corporate power limits on corporate power can be imposed either by
(i) law or (ii) the articles of association of the guarantor.

1. Limitations imposed by law

Pursuant to the Luxembourg Civil Code, a company is incorporated with a view to participate in the profits (and
the losses) which may arise therefrom. The goal to share the profits is an essential element of every company and
therefore, a purely free (or gratuitous) act, without consideration, may be outside the scope of the activities of a company
as contemplated by law. A company may however carry out gratuitous acts whenever these acts are accomplished with a
view to the realization, directly or indirectly, of the guarantor’s corporate objective. It is normally understood that except
in exceptional circumstances, an intragroup security is a type of act which may serve the purpose of realizing a profit.

Thus, it is only in exceptional circumstances where there is no reasonable indirect potential benefit of, or a
motivated interest for, a proposed guarantee/security to be given by a company, that the validity of such a guarantee
could be challenged for lack of any interest by the guarantor in providing the guarantee.

Further to this general legal restriction, additional limitations are imposed by specific laws, such as the
prohibition to exercise a financial activity without a specific authorization (which in the case of a Luxembourg company,
does not apply to financial activities within a group of companies) or the limitation on financial assistance to
shareholders in the case of subscription or purchase of shares of the guarantor.

2. Limitations imposed by the articles of association

The provision of guarantees by a Luxembourg company must be within the limits of the object clause of its articles of
association. Should the provision of a guarantee by a Luxembourg company be considered to exceed the corporate
objective as expressed in the articles of association, it is still bound by such action, unless there is evidence that the
beneficiary of such acts knew that the acts exceeded the corporate objective or that the beneficiary could not, in light of
the circumstances, have been unaware of that fact.

303


-----

**_Corporate authority_**

When a Luxembourg company grants guarantees, applicable corporate procedures normally entail that the decision be
approved by a board resolution or by the decision of delegates that have been appointed for such purpose (if any). In
addition, the granting of the envisaged guarantees must comply with the Luxembourg company’s corporate object as set
out in the company’s constitutional documents.

**_Corporate benefit_**

The proposed action by the company must be “in the corporate interest of the company”, which is a translation
of the French “intérêt social”, an equivalent term to the English legal concept of corporate benefit.

The concept of “corporate interest” is not defined by law, but has been developed by doctrine and court
precedents and may be described as being “the limit of acceptable corporate behavior”. Whereas the previous discussions
regarding the limits of corporate power are based on objective criteria (provisions of law and of the articles of
association), the concept of corporate benefit requires a subjective judgment to be made by the management body of the
company and is ultimately a matter of fact.

With respect to guarantors incorporated in Luxembourg, even if the Luxembourg law of August 10, 1915 on
commercial companies, as amended and reinstated (the “Companies Act”), does not provide for rules governing the
ability of a Luxembourg company to guarantee the indebtedness of another entity of the same group, it is generally held
that within a group of companies, in the context of a group of related companies, the existence of a group interest in
granting upstream or cross-stream assistance under any form (including under the form of guarantee)to other group
companies could constitute sufficient corporate benefit to enable a Luxembourg company to grant such guarantee, if,
without limiation (and subject in any event to all the factual circumstances of the matter):

(i) such guarantee is given for the purpose of promoting a common economic, social and financial interest
determined in accordance with policies applicable to the entire group,

(ii) the commitment to grant such guarantee or security is not without consideration and such commitment
must not be manifestly disproportionate in view of the obligations entered into by other group
companies, and

(iii) such guarantee or any other financial commitments must not exceed the financial capabilities of the
committing company.

The granting of cross- or up-stream guarantees by a Luxembourg company in order to secure the obligations of
other entities may raise some corporate benefit issues, in particular in relation to the corporate interest of the Luxembourg
company having to provide such guarantees.

Although the existence of a corporate interest in the granting of a guarantee on a group level is certainly
important, the mere existence of such a group interest does not compensate for a lack of corporate interest for one or
more of the companies of the group taken individually. The concept of corporate benefit is of particular importance in the
context of misuse of corporate assets (abus de biens sociaux) provided for by Article 1500-11 of the Companies Act.

There is a limited risk that the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company be held liable if, inter alia:

     - the guarantee so provided would materially exceed the (direct or indirect) benefit deriving from the secured
obligations for the Luxembourg company; or

     - the Luxembourg company derives no personal benefit or obtains no direct or indirect consideration for the
guarantee granted; or

    - the commitment of the Luxembourg company exceeds its financial means.

The failure to demonstrate a corporate benefit requirement will typically result in liability (personal and/or
criminal) for the directors or managers of the guarantor concerned. The guarantees granted by a Luxembourg company
could themselves be held void or unenforceable if their granting is contrary to Luxembourg public policy (ordre public).

It should be stressed that, as is the case with all criminal offenses addressed by the Companies Act, a director or
a manager of a company will in general be prosecuted for misuse of corporate assets (abus de biens sociaux) only if

304


-----

someone has lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor. This person may be an interested third party, e.g., a creditor,
a minority shareholder, a liquidator or an insolvency receiver. In addition, it cannot be excluded that the public
prosecutor could act on its own initiative if the existence of such a misuse of corporate assets became known to him. If
there is a misuse of corporate assets criminally sanctioned by court, then this could, under general principles of law, have
the effect that contracts concluded in breach of Article 1500-11 of the Companies Act will be held null and void, as
mentioned above.

The criteria mentioned above have to be applied on a case-by-case basis, and a subjective, fact-based judgment
is required to be made, by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg guarantor.

As a result of the above developments, the guarantees granted by a Luxembourg company will be subject to
certain limitations, which will take the form of general limitation language (limiting the guarantee obligations of such
Luxembourg company to a certain percentage of, inter alia, its net assets (capitaux propres)), which is inserted in the
relevant finance document(s), indentures or guarantee agreements and which covers the aggregate obligations and
exposure of the relevant Luxembourg company under all finance documents, indentures or guarantee agreements.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of Notes Guarantees and granted by any Mexican subsidiaries**

Under Mexican law there are certain rules under which guarantees may be diminished in their enforceability or
could be limited according to the procedures under which obligations could be limited in amount. Following is a brief
summary of the main legal considerations by which Mexican law may adversely affect and or limit the validity and/or
enforceability of guarantees:

    - If, at any time prior or after the Offering, the Mexican Guarantor has breached its obligations and any
of its creditors files a claim or initiates a trial before a Civil or Mercantile Court, and/or files a note and
requests that such note is registered before the relevant Public Commerce Registry, its obligations as
Guarantor under the Offering will be limited to the remaining balance of the Guarantor after such
claims are filed.

    - If any third party claims that the guarantee has been given in order to avoid obligations or to diminish
the solvency of the Guarantor for a determined and proved reason, it could be considered as a
fraudulent act which would limit the Guarantor obligations and its assets would be secured until the
legal situation of the Guarantor is resolved, in which situation the Issuer will have no legal option to
enforce the obligations of such entity as a Guarantor.

    - The Commerce Code, the Civil Federal Code, the Local Civil Codes and the Mercantile Bankruptcy
Law determine certain circumstances under which a third party will not be able to claim any
obligations to the Guarantors.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of Notes Guarantees and security interests granted by any Dutch**
**subsidiaries**

**_Limitations on the Validity of the Notes Guarantees_**

Each Notes Guarantee given by a Dutch Guarantor and any security created by it shall be limited as follows:

(a) Pursuant to section 2:98(c) of the Dutch Civil Code, a Dutch Guarantor which is a limited liability company
(naamloze vennootschap) may not provide collateral, guarantee the price, otherwise act as surety or otherwise
bind itself jointly or severally with or for third parties, for the purpose of the subscription for or the acquisition
of shares by third parties in its own capital or of depositary receipts therefor; this prohibition also applies to the
subsidiaries of such a Guarantor, including most likely its foreign subsidiaries.

(b) The granting of Notes Guarantees by the Dutch Guarantors is furthermore subject to other rules of Dutch law
relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and remedies, including rules on ultra vires and
fraudulent transfers. See "—Limitations on enforcement of the Notes Guarantees and security interests" and "—
_Fraudulent transfer provisions of general applicability including during bankruptcy—The Netherlands"._

305


-----

**_Limitations on Enforcement of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests_**

You may not be able to enforce, or recover any amounts under, the Notes Guarantees or the Collateral provided
by the Guarantors incorporated in the Netherlands due to restrictions on the validity and enforceability of guarantees and
security interests under Dutch law.

Under Dutch law, it is uncertain whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the
claim purported to be secured by such security interests. For that reason, the security documents pursuant to which a
security interest will be granted in the assets of the Dutch subsidiaries use a parallel debt structure, whereby the Dutch
subsidiaries undertake to pay to the Security Agent, as separate and independent obligations, amounts equal to the
amounts due by them to the holders of the Notes offered hereby. This parallel debt structure therefore creates a separate
and independent claim of the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered hereby which can be secured
by a security interest.

Consequently, the security interests are granted to the Security Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Notes
offered hereby, in its own capacity as creditor acting in its own name, pursuant to the parallel debt and not as a
representative (vertegenwoordiger) of the holders of the Notes. It is expressly agreed in such a parallel debt provision
that the obligations of the debtor to the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes offered hereby shall be
decreased to the extent that the corresponding principal obligations to the holders of the Notes are reduced and vice
versa. However, such a parallel debt structure has never been tested before a Dutch court, and it cannot be assured that
this parallel debt structure will mitigate or eliminate the risk of unenforceability posed by Dutch law.

Under Dutch law, receipt of any payment made by any Dutch subsidiary under a Notes Guarantee or security
interest may be adversely affected by specific or general defenses available to debtors under Dutch law in respect of the
validity, binding effect and enforceability of such Notes Guarantee or security interest. The validity and enforceability of
a Notes Guarantee of, or a security interest granted by or in, a Dutch subsidiary may also be successfully contested by the
Dutch subsidiary, or its trustee in bankruptcy (curator), on the basis of an ultra vires claim. The validity and
enforceability of the obligations of any of our Dutch subsidiaries under a Notes Guarantee or security interest may also
be successfully contested by any creditor, or by a Dutch subsidiary's trustee in bankruptcy when the Dutch subsidiary is
in bankruptcy proceedings, if such obligation is prejudicial to the interests of any other creditor and the other
requirements for fraudulent transfer under the Dutch Civil Code and Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet) are met.
As a result, the value of the Notes Guarantees and security interests provided by the Dutch subsidiary may be limited.

**_Foreclosure of Dutch security rights_**

Pursuant to the Dutch security documents, the Security Agent may enforce the Dutch law security rights in case
of certain events, which include a Dutch bankruptcy (faillissement) suspension of payments (surseance van betaling) or
emergency measures (noodregeling) in respect of the providers of Dutch security rights.

Enforcement of security rights in a Dutch court is subject to Dutch rules of civil procedure. In addition,
foreclosure on Dutch law security rights (including allocation of the proceeds) is subject to Dutch law. Under Dutch law,
security rights are in principle enforced through a public auction of the relevant assets in accordance with Dutch law.
Shares in a Dutch private company with limited liability (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) as well
as a public limited liability company (naamloze vennootschap) may only be transferred upon foreclosure in accordance
with Dutch law and the relevant pledged company’s articles of association as they read at the time of foreclosure.

The Security Agent or the relevant security interest provider may request the competent court to approve a
private sale of the security assets, except, in case of pledged assets if otherwise agreed. In case of pledged assets (but not
mortgaged assets), the Security Agent and the security interest provider may agree to an alternative foreclosure procedure
once the pledge has become enforceable. The Security Agent may also request the competent court to determine that the
pledged assets shall accrue to it for a price determined by the court. In the case of a pledge, the right of the relevant
security interest provider to request approval of a private sale may be excluded. In the case of a mortgage, there is no
such possibility.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of Notes Guarantees granted by any Polish subsidiaries**

Under Polish law, claims may become time-barred (with a six-year general term established for claims and a
three-year term for claims pertaining to periodical performances and claims resulting from an economic
activity; however, the end of the limitation period is on the last day of a calendar year, unless the limitation period is
shorter than two years) according to the Polish Civil Code (Kodeks Cywilny). It is worth noting that claims under bonds,

306


-----

including claims for periodical benefits, become be barred by limitation after the elapse of 10 years. Additionally, claims
may be, or may become, subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim.

In the case of tort claims under Article 442 (1) § 1 of the Polish Civil Code, the period of limitation is 3 years
from the date on which the injured party becomes aware of the damage and of the person obliged to remedy it, however,
the period cannot be longer than 10 years from the date on which the said event causing the damage took place.

The term "enforceable" means that a claim right or agreement is of a type and in a form enforced by Polish
courts. It does not mean that an obligation will be enforced in accordance with its terms in every circumstance in Poland;
in particular, specific performance may not always be available as a remedy due to other legal implications such as force
majeure, circumvention of law, abuse in the exercise of rights or misrepresentation.

In general terms, under Polish law, any guarantee must guarantee or secure another obligation to which it is
ancillary, which must be clearly identified in the relevant guarantee or security agreement. Therefore, the guarantee or
security interest follows the underlying obligation in such a way that nullity of the underlying obligation entails nullity of
the guarantee or security and termination of the underlying obligation entails termination of the guarantee or security.

The scope of the guarantor's obligation is determined each time by the scope of the debtor's obligation.
However, an act in law performed by the original debtor with its creditor after issuance of the guarantee cannot increase
the obligation of the guarantor without its consent.

If a guarantee given by the Polish Guarantors relates to future debts, then from the perspective of the Polish
Civil Code the maximum amount of guaranteed debt should be specified in the guarantee document. The guarantee
unlimited in time for a future debt may be revoked by the guarantor at any time before the debt arises.

In the event that the security providers are able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed
obligations, Polish courts may consider that the security providers' obligations under the relevant guarantees or securities
are not enforceable.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of Notes Guarantees granted by any Portuguese subsidiaries**

Under Portuguese law, claims may become time-barred (20 years being the general term established for
obligations under Article 309 of the Portuguese Civil Code (Código Civil)) or may be or become subject to the defense of
set-off or counterclaim.

Under Portuguese law, any guarantee must guarantee or secure a primary obligation to which it is ancillary. The
primary obligation must be clearly identified in the guarantee or security agreement, and the nullification or termination
of the primary obligation entails the nullification or termination of the ancillary guarantee or security. Consequently, if
the primary obligation is deemed null and void, the ancillary guarantee or security interest will also be deemed null and
void.

In the event that the security providers are able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed
obligations, Portuguese courts may consider that the security providers' obligations under the relevant guarantees or
securities are not enforceable.

As a general rule under Portuguese Law (Article 6, No. 3, of the Portuguese Companies' Code), the granting of
guarantees by companies to secure debts of other entities is inadmissible, as it is considered to fall outside the scope of a
company's corporate purpose. This legal rule is based on the general principle that companies shall have the purpose of
generating profit and shall not perform non-profitable or gratuitous acts. Consequently, Portuguese companies may issue
guarantees and create security interests only in respect of their own debts, except under limited circumstances and
exceptional terms.

The first requirement to allow the creation of security interests in respect of the performance of third-party debts
is for the provider of such security interests to enjoy a justified self-interest in doing so, requiring the matter to be
evaluated on the separate and independent positions and interests of each company. The law does not state nor imply
what is considered justified self-interest, and therefore, such term is open to interpretation by each company and its
management involved in such a transaction. It is common market practice in Portugal for a "justified own interest" to be
expressly recognized by the guarantor's board of directors. It is also common for the financing banks to require that the
shareholders also recognize the existence of "justified own interest" by means of a shareholders' general meeting,
confirming the view of the board of directors.

307


-----

In addition, the law provides that the issuance of security interests in respect of third-party obligations is also
admissible in cases where the third-party is in a control or group relationship with the guarantor, recognizing "justified
own interest" at a group level. However, the guaranteeing or financing of an acquisition by the target is highly restricted
within the Portuguese legal framework, namely through Article 322 of the Portuguese Companies Code. In this regard,
joint stock companies cannot issue loans or by any means grant capital or provide guarantees for the purpose of a thirdparty underwriting or by any other means acquiring their shares.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of Notes Guarantees and security interests granted by any Romanian**
**subsidiaries**

Under Romanian law, as a rule claims may become time-barred (three years being the general term established
for obligations under Article 2.517 of the Romanian Civil Code (Codul Civil)) or may be or become subject to the
defense of set-off or counterclaim.

Under Romanian law, corporate guarantees are a form of personal guarantees (as opposed to real security
interests) called sureties (in Romanian, fidejusiune).

According to the Romanian Civil Code, under the sanction of absolute nullity, sureties have to be concluded in
writing.

The agreement which ascertains the guarantee has to identify the object of the surety and, if the case, any limits
for the surety, considering that these types of guarantees are limited to the obligations which are guaranteed through
them. The Romanian Civil Code expressly states that in case the surety exceeds what is owed by the debtor or was
contracted under more burdensome conditions, it is limited to what the debtor actually owes. Moreover, in lack of a
contrary provision in the surety agreement, the obligation of the guarantor is extended to all accessories of the guaranteed
obligation and the expenses incurred by the creditor related to the notification of the guarantor and the court expenses.

Sureties are ancillary to the obligation they guarantee. To this extent, the nullity of the guaranteed obligation
entails the nullity of the surety.

With respect to the enforcement of the surety, under Romanian law, the guarantor has the right to invoke against
the creditor wishing to enforce the surety the following:

    - The right of the guarantor to request the creditor to enforce first the assets of the debtor (in Romanian,
_beneficiu de discutiune). In order for this right to be effective, the following cumulative conditions_
have to be met:

– the guarantor has not waived this right;

– the benefit of discussion is invoked before the merits of the court;

– the guarantor indicates to the creditor the goods of the debtor that can be enforced;

– the guarantor pays to the creditor the sums necessary for such enforcement.

    - The right of the guarantor to request the creditor, in case of several sureties, to divide its claim between
all the guarantors (in Romanian, beneficiu de diviziune). In case a certain guarantor is insolvent, then
the guarantor requesting the benefit of division will be proportionally liable for the respective
insolvency, except for the situation where the insolvency results after the division of the claim;

– As a rule, both such rights of the guarantor can be contractually waived.

– However, when undertaking a guarantee as a joint guarantor or joint co-debtor, a guarantor
can no longer invoke either of the benefits referred above. A guarantor is only jointly and
severally liable with the debtor if this is expressly indicated in the guarantee agreement.

– All defenses that the debtor can invoke against the creditor, except those that are personal to
the debtor or are excluded by the surety agreement.

Under Romania law, the guarantee obligations of an Romanian entity are subject to compliance with, inter alia,
the rules on corporate benefit and corporate authorization. The concept of corporate benefit is not explicitly defined in the

308


-----

Romanian law and is determined on a case-by-case basis, considering the overall risk undertaken by the Romanian
guarantor by comparison with its (direct or indirect) economic benefit and its interest to provide such Guarantee.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of Notes Guarantees and security interests granted by any Spanish**
**subsidiaries**

Under Spanish law, claims may become time-barred (five years being the general term established for
obligations in personam under Article 1,964 of the Spanish Civil Code (Código Civil)) or may be or become subject to
the defense of set-off or counterclaim.

A Spanish court may not accept acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if the default is of
minimal importance. To be recognized by the Spanish courts as giving rise to the remedy of acceleration, a default must
be material. The decision to accelerate an agreement must be based on objective facts and cannot be left to the sole
discretion of one party as this would not be permitted by article 1,256 of the Spanish Civil Code.

The terms "enforceable", "enforceability", "valid", "legal", "binding" and "effective" (or any combination
thereof) mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type
enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances
in accordance with their terms. Enforcement before the courts will in any event be subject to:

    - the nature of the remedies available in the courts;

    - Spanish public policy; and

    - the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) set-off (unless validly waived), circumvention
of law (fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force
majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, abatement and counterclaim.

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees is also subject to the laws regulating insolvency or
liquidation proceedings and to other laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors
rights and remedies.

Under Spanish law, any guarantee or pledge generally must guarantee or secure a primary obligation to which it
is ancillary. The primary obligation must be clearly identified in the guarantee or security agreement, and the nullity or
termination of the primary obligation entails the nullity or termination of the ancillary guarantee or security.
Consequently, if the primary obligation is deemed null and void, the ancillary guarantee or security interest will also be
deemed null and void, and may be affected by any amendment, supplement, waiver, repayment, novation or extinction of
the Issuer's obligations under the Notes. In addition, an extension of maturity granted to a debtor by a creditor without the

consent of the guarantor extinguishes the guarantee.

In the event that the guarantors are able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed obligations,
Spanish courts may consider that the obligations of the guarantors under the relevant guarantees or security agreements
are not enforceable.

The obligations under the Notes Guarantees granted by the Guarantors:

    - shall not extend to any use of the proceeds of the Notes for the purpose of acquiring shares representing
the share capital of such Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of its holding company or
the payment of any costs or transaction expenses related therein, or refinancing a previous debt
incurred for the acquisition of shares representing the share capital of such Guarantor or shares
representing the share capital of its holding company; and

    - shall be deemed not to be undertaken or incurred by the Guarantor being a Spanish public limited
company (sociedad anónima) or a Spanish private limited company (sociedad de responsabilidad
_limitada), to the extent that the same would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning_
of Articles 150 and 143 of the Spanish Capital Companies Law, respectively, and, in that case, all
provisions of such Notes Guarantee shall be construed accordingly in the sense that in no case can any
Notes Guarantee or security given by the Guarantor secure repayment of the above-mentioned funds.

309


-----

The interpretations of the laws of Spain by the courts may limit the ability of Spanish Guarantors to guarantee
the Notes. Although the law does not establish any limit, certain judgments indicate (and certain scholars understand) that
risks associated with a guarantee or a security interest provided by a company to secure the indebtedness held by other
companies within its corporate group shall be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the
guarantor's own perspective and justified under the corporate interest of such guarantor and all this must be evidenced to
the judge.

Under Spanish law, the valid creation of an in rem right of security requires at least the formalization of the
relevant security document as a public deed (escritura o póliza), without prejudice to any additional formalities or
perfection requirements that may be required depending on the type of secured asset. Without notarization of the security
documents, the secured parties (i) will not have access to the executive summary proceedings (juicio ejecutivo) in case of
judicial enforcement of the security documents in Spain, having the secured parties to follow necessarily the ordinary
judicial proceedings (juicio ordinario) and (ii) will not be considered as secured creditors having a special privilege over
the assets part of the security package in case of insolvency of the relevant Spanish security provider.

Security interests must be granted in favor of each and every one of the Secured Parties under the relevant
security document, and each secured party must accept said security interest.

Spanish law neither expressly recognizes the concept of security agent nor the concept of trustee and, therefore,
the security agent or trustee structure may not be recognized by Spanish courts. Therefore, when an entity acts as security
agent of the actual beneficiaries of a security interest or a guarantee (i.e., the creditors of the secured obligations), such
security agent must be duly empowered for that purpose by the relevant secured creditors at the time it acts as security
agent. Otherwise the security interest or guarantee will not be validly created in favor of its purported beneficiaries.
Particularly, since holders of the Notes will not have any power to enforce the Collateral securing the Notes except
through the Security Agent, there is some uncertainty as to whether or not a Spanish court would actually recognize
holders of the Notes as Secured Parties, whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as
registered holders in a security document will be validly secured or whether the Security Agent would only be able to
enforce the guarantees or the security interest in respect of its portion of the secured obligations but not that of the other
secured parties. Therefore, validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the secured parties through
the Security Agent, and enforcement thereof by the Security Agent, may be subject to a due and express power of
attorney granted by each of the secured parties in favor of the Security Agent for such purpose, duly notarized and
legalized (or, if applicable, duly apostilled in accordance with the Hague Convention of October 5, 1961).

Although it could be argued that Article 429 of the Spanish Companies Law (which allows the representative of
the syndicate of the holders of the Notes (comisario) to enforce any security interest on behalf of all holders of the Notes
under certain circumstances) could apply by analogy, it cannot be disregarded that, if enforcement of the security interest
is carried out by the Security Agent, it may be necessary to prove that the Security Agent is duly and expressly
empowered for such purpose by means of a power of attorney granted in favor of the Security Agent by each of the
Secured Parties duly notarized and, if not granted in Spain, with the apostille of The Hague Convention dated October 5,
1961 or legalized. In the absence of the abovementioned powers of attorney, the Security Agent may not be able to
enforce the relevant Spanish security interest on behalf of all of the secured creditors (including the holders of the Notes),
and there is a risk that the Security Agent would only be able to enforce the security interest against the debt that it
individually holds, and not for the full amount owed to creditors for whom it may be acting as Security Agent. Further,
those beneficial holders of the security who have not duly accepted the security or duly empowered (by means of notarial
and apostilled powers of attorney) the Security Agent to do so may be treated, from a Spanish law perspective including
without limitation in an insolvency scenario, as unsecured creditors.

In addition, the effects that might arise due to application of the Spanish Insolvency Law include, among others,
that when confronted with Spanish security in which only a security agent (or similar entity) is acting on behalf of itself
and other secured creditors, the insolvency court may challenge the distribution of any enforcement proceeds amongst the
different creditors made by such security agent under intercreditor agreements or provisions. Such challenge would be
made on the basis that in order for a secured creditor to have a privileged claim, such secured creditor has to be the
beneficiary of the security from a Spanish perspective and that the eventual intercreditor provisions may only bind the
signatories to such agreement, but may not be enforced vis-à-vis third parties.

Furthermore, the relevant court or notary public before whom any Spanish security interest may be enforced
might request both the notarization of the documents from which the relevant obligations arise, and the notarization of
each and every one of the transfer certificates regarding each and every transfer of the Notes.

Given that the concept of "trust" and/or "parallel debt" is not recognized under Spanish law, guarantees/security
interests require that the beneficiary of the guarantee/security interests and the creditor to be the same person. Such

310


-----

guarantee/security interests cannot be held by a third-party which does not hold the guaranteed/secured claim but
purports to hold guarantees/security interests for the parties that do. If Spanish law security documents are entered into
only by the Security Agent (and not by the creditors on account of whom it would be acting), the Security Agent will be
the only party entitled to enforce the guarantees or the security interest in respect of those obligations. However, the
Security Agent may only be able to enforce against the debt it individually holds, and not for the full amount owed to
creditors for whom it is acting as security agent. This limitation may be overcome if such creditors grant formal powers
of attorney in favor of the Security Agent (duly notarized and legalized or, if applicable, duly apostilled in accordance
with the Hague Convention of October 5, 1961) in order for the latter to represent them in the Spanish law security
documents enforcement proceedings. Moreover, the concept of "parallel debt" may be questioned under Spanish law and
we are not aware of any court precedent where it has been recognized by a Spanish Court.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of Notes Guarantees granted by any Swiss subsidiaries**

The granting of guarantees by the Swiss Guarantors is subject to certain restrictions under Swiss corporate law.
Therefore, in order to enable the Swiss Guarantors to grant guarantees securing liabilities of the Issuer without the risk of
violating such restrictions and protect management from personal liability, it is market practice for guarantees granted by
a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) or limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung)
incorporated in Switzerland to contain "limitation language". Pursuant to such limitation language, the enforcement in
relation to any obligation, undertaking, indemnity or liability of the Issuer or any subsidiary of the Issuer, including the
Notes Guarantee granted by each of the Swiss Guarantors, will be limited to the maximum amount permitted by law at
the time of fulfilment or enforcement (as the case may be). This in particular reflects the requirement that payments
under a Notes Guarantee may in certain cases not cause the Swiss Guarantor to incur a liability which would exceed its
freely distributable equity at the time of enforcement of the Notes Guarantee. The freely distributable equity is equal to
the maximum amount that the relevant Swiss Guarantor can distribute to its shareholders as a dividend payment under
Swiss law. These limitations apply in relation to guarantees securing the performance of any obligations of any direct or
indirect parent or sister company of the Swiss Guarantors.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of Notes Guarantees granted by any Uruguayan subsidiaries**

Under Uruguayan law, there is a minor risk that the Notes Guarantee granted by the Uruguayan Guarantor
would be deemed contrary to the corporate purpose of the Uruguayan Guarantor. Shareholder approval of the Notes
Guarantee based upon the fact that it is part of a refinancing plan of the Group and therefore executed in the common
interest of the both the Guarantor and the Issuer would significantly reduce this risk.

Under the Uruguayan Civil Code, guarantees of any kind, including mortgages, pledges or guarantees (Fianza),
generally must guarantee or secure a primary obligation to which it is ancillary. Therefore, the nullification or
termination of the primary obligation entails the nullification or termination of the ancillary guarantee or security.
Consequently, if the primary obligation is deemed null and void, the ancillary guarantee or security interest will also be
deemed null and void. Pledges, mortgages and guarantees are governed by different regulations.

Under Uruguay's new bankruptcy laws, a mortgage or registered pledge will be considered privileged in a
bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding only if it is registered in the Registry before the date of declaration of insolvency or
bankruptcy. A pledge under the Civil Code will be considered privileged only if it is granted in a public deed or private
document and dated. Privileged security interests are nevertheless incorporated into an insolvency or bankruptcy
proceeding against the debtor.

According to Uruguayan law, claims may become time barred. Generally, in rem actions are barred after
20 years, and actions seeking enforcement of personal rights are barred after 10 years.

**_Guarantees (Fianza)_**

Uruguayan conflict of law rules regarding guarantees consider guarantees to be accessory to the primary
obligation, and as a consequence, the law governing the primary obligation will also govern the guarantee.

Under Uruguay's article 2102 of the Civil Code, a guarantee is a contract under which a third-party assumes the
obligation to pay on behalf of a debtor. To be valid, a guarantee must always be accessory to a primary obligation and
must always be written. A guarantee cannot exceed the primary obligation, nor can a guarantee be executed under more
onerous conditions regarding place, time, conditions, payment methods or penalties. If a guarantee is executed under
more onerous conditions than those contained in the primary obligation, the guarantee will be governed by the terms of
the primary obligation.

311


-----

A guarantor is only jointly and severally liable with the debtor if this is expressly indicated in the guarantee
agreement. Without prior consent from the creditor, this kind of guarantee cannot be exchanged for another guarantee,
such as a pledge or mortgage. If the guarantor becomes insolvent or bankrupt, the debtor needs to offer the creditor
another guarantee.

In order to enforce a guarantee, a creditor must show that it has executed all possible legal actions against the
debtor to recover the debt (Beneficio de Excusión). A guarantor has no right to Beneficio de Excusión when: (i) the
guarantor has expressly waived it, (ii) the guarantor is jointly and severally liable with the debtor, (iii) the debtor has
become bankrupt or insolvent, (iv) the debtor cannot be sued in Uruguay, (v) the guarantee gives the creditor no right of
enforcement (obligación natural) or (vi) the guarantee is judicial. In the case of the Notes, as the Guarantor is jointly and
severally liable with the debtor, it has no right to benefit from the Beneficio de Excusión. In the case of judicial
enforcement of a guarantee, a guarantor is entitled to allege all possible defenses regarding the primary obligation but
may not allege the personal defenses of the Debtor.

A guarantee terminates when the primary obligation terminates and may also terminate due to compensation,
waiver of recovery of the debt by the creditor, novation or confusion. If a guarantor is jointly and severally liable with the
debtor, the guarantor cannot take the place of the creditor in its rights, privileges or mortgages against the debtor where
the guarantor fulfills the debtor's obligations. Finally, if the term of the primary obligation is extended without the
consent of the guarantor, the original guarantee terminates.

A guarantor may offset its obligation to a creditor with any debts the creditor owes the guarantor or any credits
the debtor has against the creditor. Assignment of the primary obligation results in assignment of the accessory
guarantee.

**Applicable insolvency laws**

**_European Union_**

The need of an international bankruptcy law was satisfied with the entry into force, in the European Union, of
the Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346 of May 29, 2000 (the “EC Bankruptcy Regulation”) on cross-border insolvency
procedures, which uniformly regulated the main issues of jurisdiction and applicable laws in the insolvency procedures
by referring to the center of main interests (so-called COMI) located in a Member State. Article 3, paragraph 1, of the EC
Bankruptcy Regulation provided that the court of the member state “within the territory of which the center of the
_debtor’s main interests is situated” is competent to commence the main insolvency proceedings. “Centre” referred to, in_
the case of a company or legal entity, the place of its registered office. As set forth in Article 3, paragraph 2, the courts of
a member state in which the debtor has a permanent establishment can initiate secondary insolvency proceedings against
a debtor whose center of main interests is within another member state. In such an event, the effects of the secondary
proceedings are limited to the assets situated in the territory of the first member state and aimed at the liquidation of the
insolvent company.

On May 20, 2015, the European Parliament and the Council enacted the EU Regulation no. 848/2015 (the
“Recast Bankruptcy Regulation”), which entered into force on June 25, 2015 and is applicable to insolvency
proceedings starting from June 26, 2017, with few exceptions (Articles 24, first paragraph, 25 and 86). The new rules
also apply to proceedings which provide for the restructuring of a debtor, the so-called “hybrid proceedings”, for example
the Italian debt restructuring agreements pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Bankruptcy Law. This reform does not change
the main framework of cross-border insolvency proceedings as set out under the EC Bankruptcy Regulation, but does
introduce some important changes. The aforementioned “centre of the debtor’s main interests” pursuant to Article 3 has
been more precisely defined as the “place where the debtor carries on the administration of its interest on a regular basis
_and which is verifiable by third parties”._

Another important amendment is set forth by Article 4 of the Recast Bankruptcy Regulation, stating that the
court before which a request to start insolvency proceedings has been filed shall have to examine ex officio whether it has
jurisdiction on the case. Should the court decide to open the proceedings, it shall have to specify in its decision if the
proceedings are the main proceedings or secondary proceedings, pursuant to Article 3. Immediate recognition of the
foreign bankruptcy judgments and measures are denied by Italian courts (only) if they may produce effects that are
contrary to Italian public policy, for example, if they do not grant all creditors equal treatment.

Where the EC Bankruptcy Regulation is not applicable, Italian Bankruptcy Law applies. Article 9, paragraph 1
provides that bankruptcy can be declared by the court of the place where the debtor has its “main office”. In order to give
emphasis to the notion of “main office”, Italian case law does not make reference to the place where the productive
activity is usually carried out, but to the management center of the business, i.e. the place where the business decisions of

312


-----

the company are taken. Pursuant to Article 9, paragraph 2, the transfer of the registered office of a company in the year
prior to the filing of the petition for bankruptcy is disregarded for the purpose of determining the venue and jurisdiction
of the bankruptcy proceedings of such company. According to Article 9, paragraph 3, the debtor who has its main office
abroad can be declared bankrupt in Italy, even if a declaration of bankruptcy has been rendered abroad. Furthermore, the
relocation of the business to a foreign country does not exclude the jurisdiction of Italian courts, if it occurred after the
filing of a petition for bankruptcy or the request of the Public Prosecutor.

If the “center of main interests” of the Issuer or a Guarantor is and will remain located in the state in which it has its
registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the Issuer or Guarantor under the Recast Bankruptcy
Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to
commence the insolvency proceedings. Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the Recast
Bankruptcy Regulation are to be recognized in other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary
proceedings may be opened in another Member State. If the “center of main interests” of a debtor is in one Member State
(other than Denmark), the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) may only open “territorial proceedings”
in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. In the event that any of
the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of their respective subsidiaries experience financial difficulties, it is not possible to
predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced or the
outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the validity and enforceability of the obligations of
the Issuer and of the Guarantors, as well as the validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and/or Collateral.

**_Argentine insolvency law_**

Argentine Law No. 24,522 (the "Argentine Bankruptcy Law"), contemplates two distinct forms of insolvency
proceedings: (i) reorganization (concurso preventivo), aimed at restructuring the debtor's liabilities pursuant to a plan,
and (ii) liquidation (quiebra), aimed at identifying the debtor's assets and liabilities, liquidating the assets and distributing
the proceeds therefrom among the debtor's creditors.

A reorganization proceeding may only be commenced voluntarily by a debtor that becomes unable to meet debt
payments regularly. The debtor must submit the reasons for its inability to pay his debts as they fall due as well as a
description of his probable ability to reorganize, in this case the debtor will still be managed by its natural administrators
with an oversight of a court delegate; in order to reorganize and restructure the debtor shall send a debt restructuring
proposal to its creditors, which shall be submitted to the decision of the creditors, and approved by the relevant court.

Meanwhile, liquidation proceedings that did not begin as a reorganization may be commenced voluntarily by the
debtor or involuntarily upon the filing of a petition by any of his creditors. If the proceeding is filed by a creditor, such
creditor must submit evidence that the debtor qualifies for bankruptcy and that the debtor has ceased payment of its
debts. In this case, the debtor company will be managed by a court delegate in order to liquidate the assets and dissolve
the company.

The institution of reorganization and liquidation proceedings involving a mortgagor has consequences for a
creditor with respect to certain aspects of a mortgage. Creditors whose debts are secured with a mortgage may foreclose
on the assets underlying their security interest prior to the conclusion of the reorganization proceedings. In both a
reorganization and a liquidation proceeding, a creditor who has the right to pursue non-judicial foreclosure proceedings
may hold an auction of the underlying property; provided, however, that a report is submitted to the court within 20 days
after the auction in which an accounting is set forth along with certain other information with the court. Similarly,
judicial foreclosure proceedings may move ahead in both reorganization and liquidation proceedings upon receipt by the
creditor of an order from the court permitting the continuation of the foreclosure proceeding. In a liquidation proceeding,
an expedited procedure is available for creditors seeking to foreclose on property securing underlying debts.

The commencement of either reorganization or liquidation proceedings will not suspend accrual of interest on
the debt underlying the mortgage, although such interest may only be paid from the proceeds of the sale of the assets or
property subject to the mortgage.

Pursuant to the Argentine Bankruptcy Law, ordinary obligations are subordinated to certain statutory
preferences. In the event of liquidation, such statutory preferences, including claims for salaries, wages, secured
obligations, social security, taxes and court fees and expenses, will have preference over any other claims, including
claims by any investor in respect of the Notes.

**_Austrian insolvency law_**

The Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantee provided by the Austrian Guarantor may be limited by
laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, arrangement, moratorium, reorganization or other laws relating to or
affecting generally the enforcement of the rights of creditors. The enforcement of claims under a guarantee is generally
not subject to set off but may be or become subject to counterclaims and standards of good faith, which may be applied
by the court in relation to the exercise of certain rights and remedies available to the parties. According to Art 25b (2) of
the Austrian Insolvency Code (IO) any agreement (except for, inter alia, interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and
similar contracts according to Annex II to Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 ("CRR")) that stipulates the right of the other
party to terminate an agreement solely due to the debtor's insolvency is not enforceable in relation to such termination
right.

If the Austrian Guarantor becomes insolvent, an insolvency administrator may bring avoidance claims on behalf
of the insolvency estate of the Austrian guarantor. A transaction may be avoided under the following circumstances, inter
_alia, as set out in the IO._

_Intentional discrimination against creditors (Art 28 IO):_

Under Art 28 (1) and (2) IO, an insolvency administrator is entitled to avoid transactions by a debtor if such
transactions were (1) entered into by the debtor during the ten years prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings
against the debtor with the intent (Absicht) to harm the debtor's creditors, provided that the other party was aware of the
debtor's intent; or (2) entered into by the debtor during the two years prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings
against the debtor if the counterparty must have had knowledge of such intent (Absicht) of the debtor at the time of the
transaction. The insolvency administrator also is entitled to avoid purchase, swap, and distribution agreements, which
were entered into by the debtor during the year prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor if the
other party realized or must have realized a dissipation of funds.

_Transactions for no consideration (Art 29 IO)_

Under Art 29 (1) IO, the insolvency administrator is entitled to avoid transactions entered into by the debtor for
no consideration if such transactions were entered into by the debtor during the two years prior to the opening of
insolvency proceedings against the debtor.

_Transactions favorable for one creditor (Art 30 IO)_

Under Art 30 (1) IO, the insolvency administrator is entitled to avoid transactions made during the 60 days prior
or after the insolvency of the debtor or during the 60 days prior or after the application for the opening of insolvency
proceedings against the debtor; provided that such transactions gave or made possible to an insolvency creditor security
or satisfaction to which such creditor had no right or no right to claim in such manner or at such time. Avoidance
pursuant to this provision is not possible if the voidable transaction was made more than one year prior to the opening of
insolvency proceedings against the debtor.

_Knowledge of the insolvency (Art 31 IO)_

Under Art 31 (2) IO, the insolvency administrator is entitled to avoid transactions (1) made after the debtor has
become insolvent or after an application for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed against the debtor;
provided that such transactions gave or made possible to an insolvency creditor security or satisfaction and (2) entered
into by the debtor with any other person if the transactions are directly detrimental to the debtor and the counterparty had
been aware or had been negligently unaware of the fact that the debtor was insolvent or an application for the opening of
insolvency proceedings has been filed against the debtor by the time of the transaction.

Under Art 31 (3) IO, the insolvency administrator is entitled to avoid transactions made after the debtor has
become insolvent or after an application for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor had been filed;
provided that such transaction had been entered into by the debtor to the detriment of the creditors of the debtor and

    - the counterparty had been aware or had been negligently unaware of the fact that the debtor was
insolvent or an application for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed by the time of the
transaction, and

    - the detriment for or the damage to the insolvency estate was objectively foreseeable.

314


-----

Avoidance of an agreement pursuant to this provision is not possible if the voidable transaction was made more
than six months prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor.

**_Belgian insolvency law_**

There are two types of insolvency procedures under Belgian law:

(a) judicial reorganization procedures; and

(b) the bankruptcy procedure (faillite/faillissement)

both included in Book XX of the Belgian Economic Code.

Note that in addition, Belgian law allows for liquidation in deficit (liquidation déficitaire/deficitaire
_vereffening). The latter proceedings will not be further discussed._

_The judicial reorganization_

The judicial reorganization aims to foster the recovery of a business experiencing temporary financial
difficulties by granting the business protection from its creditors. The directors of a company may apply for judicial
reorganization but are not obligated to do so. The creditors of a company may not initiate such judicial reorganization on
behalf of the company, except through a transfer under judicial supervision (as described below).

The directors of a company (and in limited circumstances, its creditors, interested third parties or the public
prosecutor) may apply with the competent commercial court for a judicial reorganization if the continuity of the company
is in danger (whether immediately or in the future). If the net assets of the company have fallen under 50% of the
company's registered capital, the continuity of the company is presumed to be at risk. The court then appoints a deputy
judge (juge délégué/gedelegeerd rechter) to supervise the company, ensure compliance with the law and report to the
Court. As a general rule, the company retains management and disposal powers on its assets.

As from the filing of the petition and as long as the court overseeing a judicial reorganization has not issued a
ruling thereon, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt or wound up by court order. During the period between the filing
of the petition and the court's decision, with a few exceptions, none of the debtor's assets may be disposed of by any of its
creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests that such creditors may hold with respect to such assets.

Within a period of 14 days as from the filing of the petition and subject to the satisfaction of the filing
conditions, the Court will declare the judicial reorganization procedure open, allowing a provisional suspension of
payments (moratorium) for a maximum period of 6 months, which may be extended to 12 months and, in exceptional
circumstances (such as due to the size of the business, the complexity of the case or the impact of the procedure on
employment) if in the interest of the creditors, to 18 months.

The effects of this moratorium may be summarized as follows:

    - the company cannot be declared bankrupt or wound up by court order until the end of the judicial
reorganization;

    - no enforcement measures with respect to pre-existing claims in the moratorium can be continued or
initiated against any of the debtor's assets from the time that the moratorium is granted until the end of
the period, with few exceptions;

    - during the duration of the moratorium, no attachments can be made with regard to pre-existing claims;

    - in principle, a company's contracts remain in force and any clauses providing for early termination or
acceleration (and certain contractual terms such as default interest) for the sole reason of the initiation
or opening of judicial reorganization shall have no effect. Subject to certain conditions, such
enforcement prohibition does not apply to close-out netting provisions. A creditor may not terminate a
contract on the basis of a debtor's default that occurred prior to the judicial reorganization procedure if
the debtor remedies such default within a 15-day period following the notification of such default;

    - the court may, depending on the circumstances, remove attachments;

315


-----

    - guarantees granted by third parties in favor of the debtor's creditors are not covered by the enforcement
prohibition imposed by the debtor's moratorium, nor are the debts payable by co-debtors, subject to
certain exceptions or qualifications in respect of guarantees granted by individuals;

    - the company can voluntarily choose to pay some creditors if necessary for the continuity of its business
activities;

    - in principle, the judicial reorganization has no effect on interest but any interest that was already due
and payable at the time of the granting of the judicial reorganization will be suspended. Interest
accruing after the granting of the judicial reorganization will not be affected by the moratorium.

As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract during
the restructuring proceedings; provided that the debtor notifies the creditor and the decision is necessary for the debtor to
be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer all or part of the company or its assets. The exercise
of this right does not prevent the creditor from suspending in turn the performance of its own obligations.

The Belgian Financial Collateral Law of December 15, 2004 (Loi relative aux sûretés financières/Wet
_betreffende financiële zekerheden), implementing the Financial Collateral Directive (2002/47/EC), provides that the_
enforcement rights of creditors benefiting from certain types of financial collateral (including a pledge over financial
instruments, e.g., a share pledge) are not suspended during the moratorium if the agreement creating the financial
collateral was signed before the start of the judicial reorganization. However, a court has decided to suspend the rights of
the pledgee during a judicial reorganization, arguing that the enforcement of the pledge during the moratorium is abusive.

The company, the public prosecutor, the deputy judge or third-parties with an interest may ask the court to
terminate the reorganization early if the company is obviously no longer able to ensure the continuity of its activities or if
the information provided to the court by the company was obviously inaccurate or incomplete.

During the provisional suspension of payments, the company facing difficulties may choose between three
different options:

    - _Amiable agreement (accord amiable/minnelijk akkoord). Negotiate a debt restructuring agreement and_
enter into a voluntary agreement with some or all of its creditors;

    - _Collective agreement (accord collectif/collectieve akkoord). Hold a creditors' meeting to approve a_
global recovery plan; and/or

    - _Transfer under judicial supervision (transfert sous autorité de justice/overdracht onder gerechtelik_
_gezag). Transfer its business, in whole or in part; such a transfer may also be ordered by the court under_
certain circumstances.

If, at any point in time, it appears that the debtor's first choice cannot be achieved, the debtor can select another
option. The debtor may switch from an amicable agreement to a collective agreement or from an amicable or collective
agreement to a transfer under judicial supervision.

_Amicable agreement_

The company can choose judicial reorganization by amicable agreement and use the moratorium period to
negotiate a debt restructuring with two or more of its main creditors. Once agreed, the amicable agreement will be
submitted to the court and the moratorium will cease. In case of an amicable agreement, only the parties to such amicable
agreement will be bound by its terms. If the company fails to reach an amicable agreement with the relevant creditors, it
may ask the court to force the relevant creditors to accept reasonable deferred payment terms, but not a debt waiver. If an
amicable agreement is reached or imposed by the court, the reorganization and the suspension will cease. As long as the
company complies with the terms of the amicable agreement, the relevant creditor is not entitled to force the sale of a
pledged asset. If no amicable agreement is reached and the moratorium period has not yet lapsed either the company will
choose another judicial reorganization option or file for bankruptcy. If the moratorium period has lapsed and the
company has not yet reached an amicable agreement, the court will close the judicial reorganization. In the judgment
closing the judicial reorganization, the court may declare the company bankrupt if the conditions thereto are met. If the
company is not declared bankrupt, all creditors regain their full rights.

316


-----

_Collective agreement_

The judicial reorganization by way of collective agreement starts with a verification of all claims to be included
in the reorganization plan. On that basis, the debtor will prepare, during the moratorium period, a reorganization plan
involving the creditors' rights following the restructuring. The reorganization plan must describe the measures
contemplated to ensure the recovery of the business (e.g., debt waiver, conversion of debt into shares, modified payment
terms, social restructuring (labor representatives to be consulted) or transfer of a branch of activity). As far as secured
creditors are concerned, the proposed reorganization plan can only propose deferred payments for a period of up to
24 months (or 36 months under certain circumstances) from the start of the judicial reorganization, and any interest must
continue to be paid according to the relevant contractual arrangement. The reorganization plan must be approved by more
than half of the creditors representing more than half of the principal amount of the claims involved (double majority). If
the plan is approved, the court will ratify it; provided the reorganization plan complies with public order and all
formalities have been duly complied with, and the moratorium will cease. The company will have to implement and
comply with the reorganization plan. If it fails to do so, the creditors may ask the court to terminate the reorganization
plan, in which case, the bankruptcy of the company will, in most cases, follow suit.

_Transfer under judicial supervision_

The court can also order the transfer of all or a part of the company, with or without the company's consent,
upon request of the company's creditors, interested third parties, or the public prosecutor if, inter alia, in the event the
company is bankrupt or attempts to reach an amicable agreement or collective agreement have failed. The court will
appoint a representative (mandataire de justice / gerechtelijke mandataris) who will manage the sale and transfer in the
name and on behalf of company. During the sale and transfer process, the court's representative must give priority to the
preservation of the company's business activities while taking into account the rights of the company's creditors. The
price offered for all the company's assets should be equal to or higher than the price that could be obtained in bankruptcy
or in liquidation for the sale of the company's assets by a bankruptcy receiver. If comparable offers are made, priority
must be given to the preservation of employment. Once an offer has been selected, the court will hear the various
stakeholders, including the secured creditors, and will approve or refuse the sale if the proposed price is lower than the
price that could be obtained in bankruptcy or in liquidation.

The company's employment contracts will in principle be transferred with the business, with certain exceptions.
Creditors benefiting from a special privilege on immovable property, such as mortgagees or pledgees in relation to a
pledge on business, have the opportunity to ask the court to subject the sale of all or part of the company to some
conditions, such as a minimum price. The court is free to accept or reject such conditions. Judicial reorganization by way
of transfer under judicial supervision could be detrimental to such creditors as they lose control over the sale of pledged
assets.

Following completion of the sale, creditors are entitled to exercise their rights on the sale proceeds, and the
judicial reorganization is closed. Any remaining part of the business can then undergo other insolvency, reorganization or
winding-up proceedings.

_Bankruptcy_

Under Belgian bankruptcy legislation, a company, which, on a sustained basis, has ceased to make payments
(cessation de paiements/staking van betaling) and whose credit is impaired (ébranlement de credit/wiens krediet geschokt
_is), will be deemed to be in bankruptcy. Cessation of payment is generally accepted to mean that the debtor is not able to_
pay its debts as they fall due. Such situation must be persistent and not merely temporary.

A company must file for bankruptcy within one month after the cessation of payments, unless the company has
filed for judicial reorganization as described above. Criminal sanctions are applicable to the directors if the company
does not file for bankruptcy within the above mentioned period. Bankruptcy procedures may also be initiated by unpaid
creditors, a public prosecutor, the provisional administrator of the debtor's assets or the liquidator of "main insolvency
proceedings" opened in another EU member state, except Denmark, according to the EU Insolvency Regulation. A
bankruptcy filing must be made with the commercial court in the district where the company has its registered office. The
period of time that runs between filing for bankruptcy and the court declaration of bankruptcy will depend upon a number
of factors, including whether the filing was made by the debtor or creditors, whether the debtor has challenged the
petition made by creditors, whether all appropriate documentation has been submitted on a timely basis or is incomplete,
and the workload of the Court. If the Court deems the conditions of bankruptcy met, it declares the company bankrupted,
establishes a date by which the creditor's claims must be submitted to the court for verification and appoints one or more
bankruptcy receivers (curateur/curator), depending on the significance of the company's business activities. The

317


-----

bankruptcy receiver (i) manages the bankrupt estate in which all assets and liabilities of the bankrupt company are
brought together and (ii) liquidates the assets to pay off the company's creditors. Upon the court declaration of
bankruptcy, the company's management powers are suspended and transferred to the bankruptcy receiver.

The receiver must decide whether or not to continue performance under ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts
existing before the bankruptcy order). The receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor; provided the receiver
obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two
exceptions apply:

    - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an
early termination or acceleration event; and

    - _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential_
element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment
since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company; parties can agree to
continue to perform under such contracts.

The bankruptcy receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the bankrupt party which are still to be
performed after the bankruptcy under any agreement validly entered into by the bankrupt party prior to the bankruptcy if
such decision is necessary for the management and the liquidation of the bankrupt estate. The counterparty to that
agreement may make a claim for damages in the bankruptcy and such claim will rank pari passu with claims of all other
unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract dissolved. The counterparty may not seek
injunctive relief or require specific performance of the contract.

The general principle of "no termination effect" is also established such that all agreements remain in force after
the declaration of bankruptcy, unless there are contractual arrangements establishing the termination of a contract and/or
entitling the relevant creditor to terminate it in the event of bankruptcy of the company. Agreements may always be
terminated by decision of the bankruptcy receiver.

As a general rule, set-off after the bankruptcy judgment is prohibited unless the requirements for the set-off
were satisfied prior to the bankruptcy declaration.

As of the day of bankruptcy, the interest due on debts that are unsecured or secured with a general privilege
ceases to accrue. This suspension of interest accrual is however not applicable to secured debts; provided, however, that
the proceeds deriving from the subsequent sale of the security securing such debts are sufficient to cover those
post-bankruptcy interests.

The Belgian bankruptcy legislation distinguishes between two types of claims in respect of the bankrupt estate.
The first type of claims includes, among others, claims arising after the bankruptcy declaration due to the continuation of
the company's business activities and claims in relation to costs incurred with a view to protect the bankrupt estate. As a
general rule, such claims are payable when due according to their own terms and, therefore, are paid before the claims of
the second type, which relate to the period before the bankruptcy declaration. Assets subject to special privilege cannot
be affected by the payment of claims of the first type.

Creditors are required to report their insolvency claims to the commercial court that declared the bankruptcy
within one month from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, providing documentary evidence of such claims. Based on
the documentation provided by the creditors and documentation held by the company, the bankruptcy receiver draws up a
list of claims and categorizes them according to Belgian law:

    - _Estate debts. Costs and indebtedness incurred by the receiver during the bankruptcy proceedings_
("estate debts") have a senior priority. In addition, if the receiver has contributed to the realization and
enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the receiver in priority out of the proceeds of
the realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors.

    - _Claims benefiting from special privileges. These claims are secured by a specific asset or right (in rem_
security), and the creditors holding these claims are entitled to enforce their privilege, subject only to
certain restrictions, including the verification of their debt by the bankruptcy receiver and a waiting
period (during the first debt verification process), which can take between 5 and 30 days from the
bankruptcy declaration. The proceeds from the disposal of assets subject to a specific privilege do not
form part of the bankruptcy estate. The creditors holding these claims are paid directly from the
proceeds of the disposal of the collateral. If the proceeds from the disposal prove to be insufficient,

318


-----

these creditors are admitted as unsecured creditors for the remaining portion of their claims; provided
that these claims were declared and accepted.

    - _Claims benefiting from a general privilege. These claims include, among others, specific labor claims_
up to a certain amount, claims for amounts relating to unpaid withholding taxes and social security
contributions and claims for other amounts to be paid to the tax authorities and the social security
authorities. During the liquidation process, claims benefiting from a general privilege are paid before
ordinary claims, in accordance with the ranking established under the Belgian Mortgages Act (loi
_hypothécaire / hypotheekwet). Assets subject to a special privilege may not be used to pay general_
privilege claims, unless there is an excess after the payment of the claim subject to a special privilege.

    - _Ordinary claims. These claims are non-subordinated and non-privileged claims, rank pari passu and_
will be paid pro rata.

    - _Subordinated claims. These claims are those subordinated to all ordinary claims by virtue of an_
agreement or pursuant to law.

As of the date of bankruptcy, creditors lose the right to bring or pursue any legal proceedings against the
bankrupt company. The rights of creditors in the process are limited to being informed of the course of the bankruptcy
proceedings on a regular basis by the receiver, opposing the sale of assets by bringing an action before the court or
requesting the temporary continued operation of the business. Attachment proceedings started prior to the bankruptcy
cease to have any effect as of the bankruptcy, unless such proceedings have already reached their final stage (i.e., the
public sale) in which case, the proceeds of the sale will benefit the bankrupt estate. As explained, the rules concerning the
attachment proceedings only apply to unsecured creditors and creditors benefiting from general liens. By contrast,
creditors benefiting from specific security or liens on movable property are allowed to enforce their security or privilege
once the procedure relating to the verification of claims has been completed. At the request of the bankruptcy receiver,
the suspension period may be extended for up to one year from the bankruptcy judgment. Such extension requires a
specific order of the court, which can only be made if the further suspension will allow for a realization of the assets in
the interest of all creditors without prejudicing the secured creditors and provided that those secured creditors have been
given the opportunity to be heard by the court. Nevertheless, the Belgian Financial Collateral Law of December 15, 2004
(Loi relative aux sûretés financières/Wet betreffende financiële zekerheden), implementing the Financial Collateral
Directive (2002/47/EC), provides that the enforcement rights of creditors benefiting from financial collateral (i.e., a
pledge over shares) are not suspended as long as the agreement creating the financial collateral was executed before the
date of the bankruptcy declaration or, if after, only to the extent that the creditor could not legitimately know that the
company had filed for bankruptcy.

For creditors with claims secured by immovable assets, the intervention of the bankruptcy receiver is necessary
to pursue the sale of the assets. The receiver will do so upon an order of the court, given either at its request or at the
request of a mortgagee. A first-ranking mortgagee will generally be entitled to pursue the enforcement of its mortgage as
soon as the report of claims has been finalized; the court may suspend such enforcement for a period of not more than
one year from the date of the bankruptcy if the suspension will allow for a realization of the assets without prejudicing
the mortgagee provided that the mortgagee has been given the opportunity to be heard by the court.

If a security, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time of the opening of insolvency
proceedings, are located in another EU Member State, the rights the creditor has under such security shall, in accordance
with the EU Insolvency Regulation, not be affected by the opening of such insolvency proceedings.

As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on its
unsecured debt or debts secured by a general privilege, such as tax administration or social security.

**_Chilean insolvency law_**

Since October 2014 there is in Chile a new insolvency law: Law Nº 20.270, which fully replaced in text and
philosophy the previous insolvency law. The new insolvency law enacts a new chapter on restructuring procedures, titled
"Bankruptcy Reorganization Procedures". The new regulated procedure is organized around two types of reorganizations:
(1) extra-judicial reorganization and (2) judicial reorganization. Additionally, two new key players are created by the law
and designed to undertake prominent roles in a bankruptcy proceeding: the "Reorganization Supervisor" (Veedor, in
Spanish) and the "Liquidator".

**A. Reorganization Supervisor and Liquidator. The debtor's three largest creditors, whether secured or**
unsecured, nominate the Reorganization Supervisor (the "Supervisor"), who must satisfy certain requirements. The

319


-----

Supervisor's main function is to facilitate the negotiations between debtors and creditors, with the goal of reaching a
reorganization agreement. In addition, the Supervisor is tasked with, among other things, safeguarding the interests of the
debtor and creditors alike, compiling information from the debtor, following restructuring procedures, and providing
status reports and information regarding any debtor misconduct to the Superintendence. While responsible for overseeing
many aspects of a reorganization proceeding, the Supervisor's most important task is to evaluate the validity of claims
and determine the value of the debtor's assets. The Liquidator is the authority responsible for overseeing all aspects of a
debtor's liquidation procedure. The Liquidator, like the Supervisor, represents the interests of the creditors and the debtor.
The Liquidator's main responsibilities include: (1) making the inventory of the debtor's assets, (2) liquidating the debtor's
assets, (3) distributing funds to creditors based on their priority and (4) soliciting financing to cover the bankruptcy costs.

**B. Extra-judicial Reorganization: Pre-packaged Plans Receive Judicial Protection. The law recognizes an**
extra-judicial reorganization procedure, whereby a court approves an Extra-judicial Reorganization Agreement that was
developed outside of the bankruptcy court. The benefit of an extra- judicial reorganization is that it is generally more
expeditious than, and does not involve many of the procedural hurdles associated with, a judicial reorganization, such as
the appointment of a Supervisor. In order for an extra- judicial plan to be court-approved, two or more creditors whose
claims represent at least 75 per cent of the total claims corresponding to their respective classes must accept the plan.
While the bankruptcy court considers approval of the plan, the court stays creditor actions against the debtor, including
solicitation of the debtor's forced liquidation. However, during this time, the debtor is prohibited from disposing of any of
its assets, except those that are essential to the debtor's ongoing business activities. After approval, the extra-judicial plan
has the same effect as a judicial reorganization plan in that it binds all creditors, regardless of whether they voted to
accept the plan.

**C. The Stay Period. A Moratorium on Actions Against the Debtor. The New insolvency law provides more**
protection to the debtor during the reorganization process, including the creation of a stay period (in Spanish "Protección
_Financiera Concursal") (the "Stay Period"). During the Stay Period, creditors are prohibited from, among other things,_
initiating any actions against the debtor's assets and property on account of pre-bankruptcy filing defaults. The Stay
Period also protects the debtor against the initiation of an involuntary liquidation action. Additionally, creditors are also
prohibited from terminating their contracts with the debtor as a result of the debtor's insolvency. Any creditor that
violates this rule will have its claims subordinated below unsecured and insider creditors. The Stay Period also protects
the interests of creditors. This is predominately accomplished through the participation of the Supervisor, whom the
debtor must co-operate with, into the debtor's business matters. During the Stay Period, a debtor is not allowed to dispose
of any real estate assets, except those sold in the debtor's ordinary course of business. The debtor is also forbidden from
modifying its bylaws without the authorization of the Supervisor. The Stay Period lasts for an initial 30 days, but can be
extended up to a total of 90 days (an additional 30 days if the debtor garners the approval of creditors representing 30 per
cent of its total debt, and another additional 30 days, for a total of 60 additional days, if the debtor garners the approval of
creditors representing 50 per cent of its total debt).

**D. Plan Approval Process. The new insolvency law provides that a plan is approved if: (a) the debtor approves**
the plan (b) at least two-thirds in amount of the creditors present at the vote, accept the plan, and (c) such creditor
acceptances represent at least two-thirds in value of the total claims entitled to vote in each respective class of claims.
Firstly, no persons related or associated with the debtor may take part in the voting. Moreover, the claims of any "Related
Person" are not counted as part of the total claims for voting purposes. There are deadlines for complying with certain
procedures, including challenging a proposed plan. Those creditors who wish to challenge a proposed plan are required to
file their objections with the Supervisor within five (5) days of the plan's publishing in the Insolvency Bulletin (the
"Challenge Period"). The court then has ten (10) days from the last day of the Challenge Period in which to hold a
hearing to address all of the challenges. From there, the court has thirty (30) days to resolve the objections to the plan,
and if said objections cannot be resolved, the debtor must propose a new plan within ten (10) days of receiving notice
that the objection to the plan was sustained. Finally, if a reorganization plan fails to meet the required quorum, then it is
considered rejected and the creditors can conduct a special vote to determine whether the debtor should be allowed to
propose another plan or if the debtor should proceed to liquidation. If the creditors vote to allow the debtor to propose
another plan, then the debtor is given ten (10) days to do so.

**E. The Authorized Sale of Some or All of a Debtor's Assets. The law contains several provisions governing**
the sale of some or all of a debtor's assets during the pendency of a bankruptcy proceeding. Article 57(2)(b) provides that
during the Stay Period, a debtor cannot consummate a sale of assets outside of the ordinary course of business, except in
accordance with Article 74. Article 74 provides that a debtor can effect a sale of assets outside of the ordinary course of
business so long as the value of the assets being sold does not exceed twenty per cent of the value of the debtor's fixed
assets. The value of the debtor's assets is to be determined by the Reorganization Supervisor. Article 74 goes on to
authorize a debtor to sell assets with a value in excess of 20% of the debtor's fixed assets, so long as such a sale has been

320


-----

approved by creditors representing at least 50% of the liabilities of the debtor. Similarly, the new insolvency law allows
the sale of a debtor's assets in a liquidation as a going concern despite an objection by the debtor.

**F. Authorizing Financing to Debtors. The law also incentivizes parties not only to continue doing business**
with, but also to lend to, a debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy. For example, Article 72 provides an incentive
for suppliers that continue doing business with the debtor. Specifically, Article 72 states that the claims belonging to
those creditors that continue doing business with the debtor while in bankruptcy shall enjoy a priority of payment over
other unsecured creditors. The one limitation under Article 72 is that such priority is limited to an amount not to exceed
20% of the total liabilities of the debtor. Article 74 permits a debtor to obtain post-filing financing during the Stay Period.
The debtor may obtain new financing that does not exceed 20% of the amount of the debtor's total liabilities without the
need of any creditor approval, and may also obtain new financing that exceeds the 20% threshold if creditors holding
more than 50% of the total debt approve such transaction. Furthermore, Article 74 provides that any party that extends
financing in accordance with Article 74 will enjoy a priority of payment for any such amounts, and that such amounts
will not be included in the list of claims 117. Article 73 states that any lender that provides financing to a debtor for the
purpose of conducting business outside of Chile maintains a priority of payment over other creditors. This is the case so
long as such a lender continues to service any existing lines of credit or extend new credit to the debtor in order to allow
the debtor to continue its business outside of Chile.

**G. Other Key Provisions. Equity Holders and Claims Purchasers. Article 67 of the new insolvency law**
provides that unless authorized by the debtor's creditors, shareholders and insiders are not allowed to receive a
distribution under the plan unless allowed claims are paid in full. Similarly, Article 79 provides that related parties,
shareholders, and owners do not have the right to vote on a plan of reorganization. Article 79 also provides that creditors
who have purchased claims within 30 days prior to the bankruptcy filing are not allowed to participate in the meeting of
creditors that will vote on the plan nor enjoy standing to challenge the plan. Nevertheless, Article 188 permits the
purchase of claims once a reorganization filing has been recognized by the court. Under Article 188, a creditor may
purchase a claim and all attendant voting rights, provided that he purchases the claim in full and does not later sell or
transfer any portion of the claim or debt underlying such claim.

**_Czech insolvency law_**

Under the current Czech Act No. 182/2006 on Insolvency ("Czech Insolvency Act"), a debtor which is a legal
entity is considered insolvent (v úpadku) when (i) it is unable to meet its monetary obligations (platební neschopnost) or
(ii) it is over-indebted (předlužen).

A debtor is considered unable to meet its monetary obligations when it has more than one creditor, it has
monetary obligations which are more than 30 days overdue, and is not able to meet those obligations. A debtor is deemed
unable to meet its monetary obligations when either (a) it stopped payments or a substantial part of them or (b) it has not
met its obligations within 3 calendar months after their due date or (c) it is not possible to satisfy any of its monetary
obligations in enforcement proceedings or (d) it failed to fulfill its duty to file with the insolvency court the lists of its
assets, obligations and employees after the insolvency petition is filed. A debtor which is a legal entity is also insolvent
when it is over-indebted, which means that it has more than one creditor and its total debts are higher than the total value
of its assets. The value of the assets is, for this purpose, estimated on a going-concern basis. However, a debtor which is a
legal entity is deemed to be able to meet its monetary obligations even though it fulfills above mentioned conditions, if
the difference between its due monetary liabilities and its disposable funds ("coverage gap" or mezera krytí) is less than
one tenth of its due date monetary liabilities or if the liquidity outlook shows that the coverage gap will be less than one
tenth of its due monetary liabilities.

As a general rule, a debtor which is a legal entity must file for insolvency without undue delay after it finds out
(or should have found out had it exercised due care) that it is insolvent. The obligation to file for insolvency spans also to
the debtor's statutory body (statutární orgán), statutory representative (zákonný zástupce) and liquidator (likvidátor).
Failure to file the insolvency petition may result in liability for damages (which, apart from the debtor, also spans to the
statutory bodies, executives and liquidators of the debtor). A debtor may also voluntarily file for insolvency when it
expects that it is in impeding insolvency (hrozící úpadek). An impeding insolvency occurs when it is reasonable to expect
(taking all circumstances into account) that the debtor will not be able to fulfill a substantial part of its monetary
obligations duly and in time. Under circumstances established by the Czech Insolvency Act, any creditor may file for
insolvency.

The petition for declaration of insolvency must be filed with the insolvency court in the Czech Republic, which
is a competent regional court (krajský soud). The filing of the petition with the competent court initiates the insolvency
proceedings. Within 2 hours upon the filing of the petition, the insolvency court shall publish the petition in the Czech
insolvency register (ISIR) maintained by the Ministry of Justice, which is publicly accessible online (no fee is required).

321


-----

The time between the petition and the insolvency declaration by the insolvency court depends on a number of
factors, including whether all appropriate documentation has been submitted duly and in time and the workload of the
court. The court will appoint an insolvency administrator in the decision on declaration of insolvency. The court may
appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator even before deciding on the debtor's insolvency. The court appoints the
same insolvency administrator to the debtors within the same business group (koncern) unless any circumstances hinder
such appointment.

Initiation of insolvency proceedings has several consequences for the rights of the creditors, stipulated in the
Czech Insolvency Act. Above all, receivables and other rights relating to the assets of the debtor may not be claimed by
way of a suit, to the extent they may be registered with the insolvency proceedings. The debtor is also required not to
take any steps outside its regular scope of business and refrain from substantial changes of its assets.

Upon the insolvency ruling (if the insolvency is handled in bankruptcy), or by way of a preliminary injunction
issued at any time before or after the insolvency ruling, the court may (upon a request or ex officio) also deprive the
debtor from the right to dispose with the debtor's assets (in case of insolvency ruling, such deprivation is an automatic
result of the ruling). In the same extent, such right automatically transfers to the insolvency administrator.

**_Procedures for resolution of insolvency_**

The Czech Insolvency Act establishes two procedures how to resolve insolvency for a debtor which is an
entrepreneur, (i) bankruptcy (konkurs) and (ii) reorganization (reorganizace). The Czech Insolvency Act also establishes
discharge from debts (oddlužení) as a third procedure for resolution of insolvency, but this procedure cannot be used to
resolve insolvency of a legal entity that is an entrepreneur.

Upon declaration of bankruptcy, the right of the debtor to dispose with its assets (to the extent that such a right
has not yet passed to the insolvency administrator) transfers to the insolvency administrator. The insolvency
administrator attempts to convert these assets into money which could be distributed to the creditors. The administrator in
particular performs/exercises shareholder's rights attached to shares of the debtor's subsidiaries and ensures the operation
the debtor's business. Any disposals of the debtor's property made by the debtor's management are ineffective vis-á-vis
the debtor's creditors.

A reorganization of a debtor is a special type of insolvency resolution aiming at settling the creditor's claims,
while ensuring the ongoing existence and business activity of the debtor. Such procedure is applicable to certain debtors
only and is governed by a reorganization plan approved by majority creditors and the court. Such plan may be proposed
by a creditor or the debtor. Upon approval of a reorganization plan, generally all rights of the creditors against the debtor
will be satisfied to the extent stipulated by the reorganization plan, and from that moment on, only those creditors listed
in the reorganization plan are considered debtor's creditors.

**_Clawback risks under Czech insolvency law_**

Any prior transactions which could be challenged as ineffective (neúčinný) do not become ineffective
automatically as a result of the initiation of insolvency proceedings. Instead, the insolvency administrator must (or
another creditor or the debtor may) expressly challenge (popřít) those transactions before the insolvency court.
Ineffective (neúčinný), for the purposes of the insolvency proceeding, are those legal acts by operation of which the
debtor either (i) curtails the chance to satisfy its creditors, or (ii) prefers certain creditors to the detriment of other
creditors. These acts may be of various natures, including a guarantee or creation of any type of in rem security interest.
The ineffectiveness of such legal acts is established by virtue of a court decision on the basis of an insolvency
administrator's petition contesting the effectiveness of such legal acts, which may be filed within one year after the court
decided on the debtor's insolvency. No creditor may file such petition, but the creditor's committee may order the
insolvency administrator to file the petition.

The legal acts which may be declared ineffective can be divided into three main groups recognized by the Czech
Insolvency Act, comprising (i) legal acts without adequate consideration, (ii) preferential legal acts and (iii) acts
intentionally curtailing satisfaction of creditors.

Firstly, a legal act is considered without adequate consideration if the debtor provided performance for free, or
for consideration which is substantially lower than the consideration usual for such performance; provided, however, that
such act was made when the debtor was already insolvent or such act directly led to the debtor's insolvency. An act
without adequate consideration may be contested if it was made in the last year before initiation of the insolvency
proceedings, or in the last three years if the counterparty was an affiliate (osoba blízká) or a member of the same holding

322


-----

(koncern), such as the Issuer. In the latter case, it is also presumed that the debtor was insolvent at the time of the legal
act.

Secondly, a legal act is considered preferential if it causes a creditor to receive, to the detriment of other
creditors, a higher performance than it would receive in bankruptcy proceedings; provided, however again that such act
was made when the debtor was already insolvent, or such act directly led to the debtor's insolvency. The Czech
Insolvency Act lists (by way of example) as preferential those acts by which the debtor (i) repaid a debt before its due
date, (ii) agreed to amendment or replacement of an obligation to its own detriment, (iii) waived its own receivable or
allowed an extinction or non-satisfaction of its own right or (iv) provided its asset as security for the debtor's obligation.
A preferential act may be contested if it was made in the last year before the initiation of insolvency proceedings, or in
the last 3 years if the counterparty was an affiliate (osoba blízká) or a member of the same holding (koncern), such as the
Issuer. In the latter case, it is also presumed that the debtor was insolvent at the time of the legal act.

Third, an act can be challenged as intentionally curtailing satisfaction of a creditor; provided that the debtor's
counterparty was aware of such intention (or should have been aware, taking all circumstances into account). Such act
may be challenged if it took place in the last 5 years before initiation of the insolvency proceedings.

If the insolvency court declares a certain legal act ineffective, the person for whose benefit the ineffective legal
act was made, or who benefited from such ineffective legal act, shall return into the insolvency estate everything the
debtor performed under such ineffective legal act. If such return is impossible, that person shall supply an adequate
compensation.

According to the same principle, the agreements to which a debtor is a party generally do not cease to exist upon
the declaration of insolvency. As a general rule, set-off is prohibited. In certain cases a set-off is possible if the conditions
for set-off arose before the decision on insolvency, or if the court permits so by way of a preliminary ruling. Claims will
not accrue interest after the declaration of insolvency unless they are secured and meet the criteria of the Czech
Insolvency Act, but any default interest never accrues.

A declaration of bankruptcy brings additional effects on the debtor's agreements and creditor's rights and claims.
Certain contracts are rescinded automatically unless the insolvency administrator declares otherwise (generally contracts
for mutual performance when the performance was not delivered). The security interests created after the decision on
insolvency cease to be effective. Generally, all debts of the debtor become due and payable. Where there are claims
subject to laws other than Czech laws, other rules may apply.

**_Claims satisfaction_**

The current Czech Insolvency Law distinguishes between (i) claims against the insolvency estate (pohledávky za
_majetkovou podstatou), (ii) claims equal (pari passu) to the claims against the insolvency estate and (iii) claims which are_
not being satisfied in the insolvency proceedings.

The first group includes claims which arose after initiation of the insolvency proceedings or declaration of
moratorium, or even after declaration of insolvency, such as (by way of example only) certain costs and expenses of the
insolvency proceedings, claims of creditors of loan facilities concluded during the insolvency proceedings or moratorium
and claims which lawfully arose with approval of the person entitled to dispose with the insolvency estate. The claims
_pari passu to the first group include certain amounts of the employee payroll and certain amounts arising from_
obligations created by law or from the non-contractual liability of the debtor. The receivables which are, as a general
rule, not satisfied in the insolvency proceedings above all, include interest and default interest, certain non-contractual
sanctions and contractual penalties.

As a general rule, claims against the insolvency estate are payable after the court decides on insolvency and
become payable upon request (which means they are payable before the general debt).

Creditors can voluntarily register their receivables immediately upon publication of the insolvency petition in
the Czech insolvency register (ISIR) until the debtor is declared insolvent. If the insolvency court declares a debtor
insolvent, it also invites the creditors to register their claims. The creditors must then register their receivables with the
court within the period of two calendar months, attaching evidence of their claim. If a creditor does not register its claim
in time, such claim generally cannot be satisfied in the insolvency proceedings. The only exception are foreign creditors
(residing / having business seat within the EU) where the insolvency court shall individually notify them in writing on the
declaration of insolvency, after it became aware of such creditors. The two months registration period for such creditors
commences on the day, in which these creditors are served with the notification of the insolvency court.

323


-----

Even claims subject to court dispute, claims adjudicated by a court decision and claims pending in enforcement
proceedings are subject to registration, as well as any receivables not yet due and any conditional receivables. As stated
above, the registered claims are reviewed by the insolvency administrator and may be challenged (popřeny) before the
court.

If the insolvency is resolved by way of bankruptcy, the creditors are satisfied in the order which is generally set
out below. The order of application in reorganization is similar, subject to the reorganization plan and specific nature of
reorganization.

    - Claims of secured creditors are satisfied from the proceeds of the sale of the things, rights, receivables
or other assets which constituted security for such claims. In such case, certain limited part of the sale
proceeds is applied to cover costs and expenses of the sale. Should there be more creditors secured by
the same asset, their claims are satisfied successively according to the time order of creation of such
security. A creditor is considered a secured creditor if it possesses a right of pledge, retention right,
restriction of real estate transfer, security transfer of right or security assignment of receivable; in each
case Czech law governed, or any similar security interest governed by foreign law. If the proceeds from
the sale of the security are insufficient for satisfaction of the secured creditor's receivable, the
unsatisfied portion of the receivable is then considered to be unsecured and satisfied among the other
unsecured claims.

    - The claims against insolvency estate and claims equal (pari passu) to the claims against the insolvency
estate are satisfied continuously.

    - Claims of unsecured ordinary creditors generally rank pari passu and are satisfied on a pro rata basis.

    - Claims contractually subordinated vis-à-vis a certain creditor or all other credits of the debtors in
accordance with the Czech Insolvency Act (including receivables from subordinated bonds issued in
accordance with Czech law), certain conditional claims and shareholder claims are satisfied after the
general creditors.

_Applicable jurisdiction_

The applicable jurisdiction to conduct an insolvency proceeding is the one in which the insolvent party has its
"center of main interests". This "center of main interests" is deemed to be where the insolvent party conducts the
administration of its interests on a regular basis and which may be recognized as such by third parties. Insolvency
proceedings conducted by the court of the "center of main interests" are considered "the principal insolvency
proceedings" and have universal reach, affecting all assets of the insolvent party worldwide. If the "center of main
interests" is not in the Czech Republic, but the insolvent party has a permanent establishment in the Czech Republic,
Czech courts will only have jurisdiction over the assets located in the Czech Republic (the "territorial insolvency
proceedings").

In the event that any Guarantor becomes insolvent and it is determined that Czech courts have jurisdiction to
handle their insolvency proceedings and that the current Czech Insolvency Law applies, the claim deriving from the
Guarantee will be treated as ordinary debt unless it is subordinated by application of any of the criteria indicated above.

Note that the current Czech Insolvency Law came into effect in January 2008 and, as such, there is only a
limited history of its application by Czech courts.

**_Dutch insolvency law_**

Insolvency proceedings relating to any of the Guarantors and providers of Collateral that have their "center of
main interest" in the Netherlands will be based on Dutch insolvency law. Under certain circumstances, insolvency
proceedings may also be opened in the Netherlands in accordance with Dutch law against companies that have an
"establishment" (vestiging) in the Netherlands. See "— Applicable insolvency laws—European Union" above for more
information.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law.

There are two primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law applicable to legal entities generally. The first,
suspension of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness
and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to

324


-----

liquidate and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. In practice, however, suspension of
payments often serves as a gateway to bankruptcy, and in bankruptcy, the trustee in bankruptcy (curator) may continue
the activities of the enterprise (if any) of the person subject to the bankruptcy before selling the enterprise or parts of it.
Furthermore, on January 1, 2021, the 'Act on the confirmation of restructuring plans' or "WHOA" (Wet homologatie
_onderhands akkoord) has entered into effect. The WHOA is a pre-insolvency procedure designed for financially_
distressed, yet viable, businesses to restructure their debts (or have their debts restructured) so as to be able to prevent
their bankruptcy. Under WHOA, a framework is introduced under which tailor-made (financial) restructuring plans can
be implemented outside formal insolvency proceedings. The WHOA combines elements of the English Scheme of
Arrangements, US Chapter 11 and the EU Restructuring Directive (EU 2019/1023). The laws applicable on suspension
of payments, bankruptcy and the WHOA are set out in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act. A general description of the principles
of these insolvency regimes is set out below.

An application for suspension of payments can be made when a debtor foresees that it will not be able to
continue to pay its debts. The application can only be made by the debtor itself. Once the request for suspension of
payments is filed, the court will immediately grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint an administrator
(bewindvoerder). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments. If a draft
composition (ontwerp akkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for suspension of payments, the court can
order that the composition be processed before a decision regarding a definitive suspension of payments is made. If the
composition is accepted and subsequently confirmed (gehomologeerd) by the court, the provisional suspension of
payments ends as soon as the court's decision becomes final. The definitive suspension of payments will generally be
granted unless a qualified minority (more than one-quarter in amount of claims held by creditors represented at the
creditors' meeting or more than one-third in number of creditors represented at such creditors' meeting) of the unsecured
non-preferential creditors withholds its consent. If a definitive suspension of payments has been granted, a composition
(akkoord) may be offered to creditors still. A composition will be generally binding on all unsecured and non-preferential
creditors if it is (i) approved by a majority in number of creditors recognized and admitted at the creditors' meeting,
representing at least 50% of the amount of claims that are admitted for voting purposes and (ii) subsequently confirmed
(gehomologeerd) by the court. Under certain conditions, the court or the judge commissioner (rechter commissaris), as
the case may be, may derogate from this procedure. As a result of the rules described above, the ability of the holders of
the Notes to effect a restructuring may be precluded or inhibited. Also, a restructuring could involve a sale of assets that
does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. Interest payments that fall due after the date on which a suspension
of payments is granted cannot be claimed in a composition. However, a suspension of payments is only effective with
regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. Secured creditors having the benefit of a Dutch law pledge (pandrecht) or
mortgage (hypotheek) and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights
against assets of a person subject to suspension of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no suspension of
payments, except that the competent court as a general rule set a period of up to four months during which a secured
creditor may not, without the court's consent, (i) claim the asset subject to the security right if it is under the control of (in
_de macht van) the debtor subject to suspension of payments or (ii) seek recourse against the asset._

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it is no longer able to pay its debts when due. The
bankruptcy can be requested by the debtor itself or by a creditor; provided there is at least one claim that is due and
payable but left unpaid and there is at least one other creditor. Bankruptcy can also be declared in certain circumstances
when a debtor is subject to a suspension of payments. Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, the court will
appoint a trustee in bankruptcy. As soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, all pending executions of judgments against the
debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor's assets (other than summary executions with respect to secured
creditors), will terminate by operation of law. If a bankruptcy is declared, the assets of the debtor subject to the
bankruptcy are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor's creditors in accordance with the
respective ranking of their claims. In principle, all creditors have an equal right to payment and the proceeds of the
bankruptcy are distributed in proportion to the size of each creditor's claims. However, certain creditors, such as secured
creditors and tax and social security authorities, have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors.
The proceeds resulting from the liquidation of the bankrupt estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors,
including secured creditors to the extent that their claims exceed the proceeds of enforcement of their security rights.
Foreign creditors are, in general, not treated different from creditors that are incorporated or residing in the Netherlands.

The claim of a creditor, other than a claim to the extent that it is secured by Dutch law security, may be limited
depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Claims (a) subject to a
suspensive condition (opschortende voorwaarde), (b) with an uncertain due date or which entitles the claimant to
periodic payments, and (c) which fall due more than one year after the date of the bankruptcy, will be valued for
distribution purposes as per the date the bankruptcy was declared. Claims which become payable within one year after
the bankruptcy was declared will be considered payable from the day that bankruptcy was declared. Interest payments
that fall due after the date of the bankruptcy will not be taken into account. The existence, value and ranking of any

325


-----

claims may be challenged. Generally, in a creditors' meeting (verificatievergadering), the trustee in bankruptcy, the
debtor subject to the bankruptcy and all creditors who have submitted claims may dispute the claims of other creditors.
Creditors of claims disputed with regard to existence, value or ranking in the creditors' meeting may be referred to
separate court proceedings (renvooi procedure). Depending on the outcome of the proceedings, the creditor may recover
less than the principal amount of his claim or less than he could recover in foreign, including U.S., proceedings.
Moreover, such procedures could also cause payments to the creditors to be delayed compared with creditors of
undisputed claims, during which delay no interest can be claimed as compensation. As in suspension of payments
proceedings, a composition may be offered to creditors in bankruptcy proceedings, which shall be binding on unsecured
non-preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a majority in number of creditors recognized and admitted at the
creditors' meeting, representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims admitted for voting purposes and
(ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Under certain conditions, the judge commissioner (rechter
_commissaris) may derogate from this procedure. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in_
Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed.

In bankruptcy, secured creditors having the benefit of a Dutch law pledge (pandrecht) or mortgage (hypotheek)
may enforce their rights as if there was no bankruptcy. This also applies to claims for interest payments that become due
after the date of the bankruptcy to the extent that these claims can be satisfied out of the proceeds of enforcement of the
security rights. The competent court may as a general rule set a period of up to four months during which a secured
creditor may not, without the court's consent, (i) claim the asset subject to the security right if it is under the control of (in
_de macht van) the trustee in bankruptcy (curator) or (ii) seek recourse against the asset. In addition, the trustee in_
bankruptcy may (x) give the secured creditor a reasonable period to exercise his rights and (y) if the creditor fails to sell
the asset within that period, claim the asset and sell it, without prejudice to the creditor's entitlement to the proceeds after
deduction of a contribution to the bankruptcy costs and taking into account his rank. Excess proceeds of enforcement
must be returned to the bankrupt estate. They may not be set-off against an unsecured claim which the secured creditor
may have. Such set-off is allowed prior to the bankruptcy although a set-off prior to bankruptcy may be subject to claw
back in the case of fraudulent transfer or bad faith when obtaining the claim or the debt subject to the set-off.

The new WHOA procedure comprises the offering of a 'restructuring plan' (akkoord) to those creditors and
shareholders affected by such restructuring plan, which restructuring plan is submitted to a voting process and may –
once voted upon in favour in accordance with the WHOA – be put forward to the court for court confirmation
(homologatie). The WHOA will apply to (i) legal entities (rechtspersonen) and (ii) natural persons practicing an
independent profession or exercising a business, with the exception of insurance companies and banks. The requirement
to start a WHOA procedure is that the debtor should be in a position where it can be reasonably assumed that the debtor
will not be able to continue paying its debts as they fall due. Other than in a suspension of payments procedure or
bankruptcy procedure the debtor will retain both the possession of its property and the authority to dispose of it during
the proceedings. A WHOA procedure can be initiated by a debtor itself or by a court appointed restructuring expert (see
below) upon request of the debtor, the creditors, shareholders or works council (if established) of the debtor who will
prepare a restructuring plan on the debtor’s behalf. A WHOA procedure provides with two different tracks, a private
procedure and a public procedure. The choice for a public or private procedure is to be made as of the time the court first
becomes involved, which is expected to usually be either at the time of filing the first declaration, or at the time of the
request to appoint a restructuring expert. Besides the difference in confidentiality of the procedures (private procedure
requests to the court are dealt with in the judge’s chambers, i.e. behind closed doors), the other main difference lies in the
ability to have a confirmatory verdict of the restructuring plan be automatically recognised in other EU member states
since the public procedure will be submitted to be included in Annex A of the European Insolvency Regulation.

The restructuring plan forms the basis of the WHOA procedure and is, in many ways, a document which is
similar to an agreement (overeenkomst) under Dutch law. Its contents are subject to the freedom of contract -principle
(contractsvrijheid), based on that a debtor has lot of freedom to decide how to restructure its debts and which creditors
will be taken into account in the restructuring plan. Except for the rights of employees, the restructuring plan may lead to
an amendment of the rights of any creditor or shareholder, including preferential and secured creditors. Once the
restructuring plan has been confirmed by the court, the plan becomes legally binding to all aforementioned creditors and
shareholders affected by the restructuring plan. Subject to certain safeguards provided under the WHOA, creditors and
shareholders who have voted against the restructuring plan can be (cross-class) crammed down and also become bound
by the restructuring plan. This sets out the main difference with a regular agreement under Dutch law: not all parties to
the restructuring plan necessarily have to agree to the plan in order to be legally bound by it.

A restructuring plan affects the rights of the parties involved and could include for example a reduction and/or
restructuring of debts by offering a percentage on claims of the class of creditors, an amendment of future recourse rights,
a debt-for-equity swap or the issuance of new shares. Moreover the WHOA procedure provides with the possibility to
amend existing contracts and – if such amendment cannot be agreed upon to terminate burdensome contracts.

326


-----

The debtor company will have to decide what creditors and/or shareholders will be affected by the plan and
shall in most circumstance have to divide such creditors/shareholders in separate classes. Each class will have to vote
separately on a restructuring plan. The debtor has a large amount of freedom to divide its creditors and/or shareholders
into separate classes. However, the WHOA sets out a few formalities and requirements. Creditors and shareholders
should be placed in different classes if the rights they would have in case of bankruptcy of the debtor, or the rights they
are offered under the restructuring plan are so different, that such creditors and/or shareholders are not in a comparable
position. Creditors or shareholders should also be placed in different classes if upon enforcement against the debtor’s
assets, they would have a different ranking based on Dutch law or under an agreement. In addition the debtor is free to
subdivide one category of creditors (e.g. unsecured creditors into different classes). It may also make different proposals
to those classes, even if it means that one class is treated more favorable than another. However, for the restructuring plan
to then fulfil the conditions for court confirmation, the debtor must ensure that (i) a required majority of the class that is
treated less favorable accepts the restructuring plan, or (ii) it offers reasonable grounds for the distinction and can
demonstrate that the interests of the creditors in the class that is treated less favorable are not affected. The same applies
for leaving out certain creditors of the same class, whilst including others. Unclarities or disputes on the class formation
can be tackled prior to putting the restructuring plan to a vote, by submitting a request to the court. The determination by
the court is legally binding for the purposes of the rest of the WHOA procedure, but only for those creditors and
shareholders who were given an opportunity by the court to express their views in the relevant hearing. Therefore this
may provide a powerful tool to pre-empt difficult discussions at the confirmation hearing.

With the WHOA two new court-appointed practitioners have been introduced: the restructuring expert
(herstructureringsdeskundige) and the observer (observator). A restructuring expert can be appointed upon request of the
debtor itself, the creditors or the shareholders or the works council (if established). The restructuring expert will prepare
an propose the restructuring plan on behalf of the debtor and will therefore largely take over any decision in the WHOA
procedure from the debtor. The appointment of a restructuring expert lowers the amount of control by the debtor on the
WHOA process and the debtor will be required to provide the restructuring expert with all documentation and
information that the restructuring expert requires in order to fulfil his duties. However, the restructuring expert has no
formal representative or decision-making authority in respect of the debtor. The observer may be appointed by the court
upon the request of the debtor, the restructuring expert, or at the court's own initiative. The request will be granted if the
court deems this to be in the best interests of the joint creditors. In addition the court will appoint an observer on its own
initiative in case the court is requested to confirm a restructuring plan with regard to which at least one class of creditors
voted and no restructuring expert or observer has yet been appointed yet. The observer’s task is to represent the interests
of the joint creditors and its role is to observe on the process of the preparation of a restructuring plan instead to prepare a
restructuring plan. The observer has to notify the court as soon as it becomes clear to him that the debtor will be unable to
put a restructuring plan into effect, or that the debtor's actions will harm the interests of the joint creditors.

After a restructuring plan has been prepared all parties affected by the plan will be invited to vote on the plan.
At least eight days prior to the actual vote, all creditors and shareholder(s) should be provided with the restructuring plan
by the debtor or the restructuring expert. A two thirds (2/3) majority in amount of the (nominal amount of) claims of all
class participants who have cast a vote is required for class acceptance. If at least one class of creditors has formally
voted in favor of the plan, the debtor or the restructuring expert, may request the court to confirm the restructuring plan.
However, if the restructuring plan affects a class of creditors whose claims would be expected to be (partially) paid in a
bankruptcy scenario (an 'in-the-money class'), it is required that at least one such in-the-money class should have voted in
favor of the restructuring plan in order for the debtor, or restructuring expert, to file the request for confirmation with the
court. After the submission of the final restructuring plan with the court the court will schedule a hearing within eight to
fourteen days after submission of the plan. Within this period of time creditors or shareholders that have voted against the
plan can request the court to reject the confirmation of the restructuring plan. The court can withheld its approval based
on the grounds for refusal (afwijzingsgronden) as specified in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act. A distinction is made between
general grounds for refusal and specific grounds for refusal. The general grounds for refusal may be put forward by any
party eligible to object to the request for confirmation. The general grounds for refusal may also be used by the court at
its own initiative to deny the request for confirmation, if it is evidently clear one of the general grounds for refusal
applies. The specific grounds of refusal can only be invoked by creditors or shareholders who have not voted in favor of
the restructuring plan and in some cases who also are included in a voting class that has voted against the plan. After the
hearing, the court will render its decision as soon as possible. Upon confirmation by the court the restructuring plan will
be binding on the debtor and all creditors that were entitled to vote on the plan.

To the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor can be challenged in an insolvency
proceeding or otherwise on the basis of fraudulent transfer. See "—Fraudulent transfer provisions of general
_applicability including during bankruptcy—The Netherlands"._

**_French insolvency law_**

One of the Guarantors is incorporated in France. Subject to the provisions of Council Regulation (EC)
No. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings and the Recast Bankruptcy Regulation mentioned above, the French Guarantor
will be subject to French laws and proceedings affecting creditors, including Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code
(Code civil), conciliation proceedings (procédure de conciliation), safeguard proceedings (procédures de sauvegarde
_accélérée et sauvegarde financière accélérée) and judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (redressement or_
_liquidation judiciaires). The safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings are intended to maintain the enterprise's_
activities and employment. The following is a general discussion of insolvency proceedings governed by French law for
information purposes only and does not address all the French law considerations that may be relevant to creditors.

_Grace periods_

Pursuant to Article 1244-1 of the French Civil Code, French courts may, in any civil proceeding involving the
debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor's financial position and the creditor's
financial needs, defer or otherwise reschedule a debtor's payment dates or payment obligations over a maximum period
of two years. In addition, pursuant to Article 1244-1, French courts may decide that any amounts, the payment date of
which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate which is lower than the contractual rate, but not lower
than the legal rate, or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of the principal. A court order under
Article 1244-1 of the French Civil Code will suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any contractual interest or
penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the period ordered by the court.

_Conciliation proceedings_

As mentioned above, French insolvency laws provide for different proceedings dealing with companies
experiencing financial difficulties. Where a company faces financial difficulties, but remains able to pay its due debts, it
may be eligible, on a voluntary basis, to the opening of conciliation proceedings.

A company may initiate conciliation proceedings (procédure de conciliation) with respect to itself; provided it
(i) is able to pay its due debts out of its available assets or has been unable to pay its due debts out of its available assets
for less than 45 days, and (ii) experiences legal, economic or financial difficulties. If the aforementioned conditions are
met, a competent court will appoint a conciliator (conciliateur) to help the company reach an agreement with its creditors
for reducing or rescheduling its indebtedness. This agreement may be either acknowledged (constaté) by the president of
the court or approved (homologué) by the court. The acknowledged or approved agreement interrupts or forbids all suits
and stops or forbids all actions filed by creditors individually relating to movable property as well as immovable property
of the debtor for the payment of claims referred to in the agreement. Such acknowledged or approved agreement further
interrupts, for the same period, the time limits within which creditors that are parties to the agreement should have acted
against the debtor;

While the acknowledgement of the agreement by the president of the court does not entail any other specific
consequences, the approval by the court will have the following consequences:

    - creditors who provide new money or goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the
business of the distressed company (other than shareholders providing new equity) will enjoy a priority
of payment over all pre-proceeding and post-proceeding claims (other than certain post-proceeding
employment claims and procedural costs), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial
reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings;

    - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the
date of cessation des paiements cannot be fixed by the court as of a date earlier than the date of the
approval of the agreement (see below the definition of the date of cessation des paiements); and

    - joint debtors and persons who have granted a cautionnement or a first demand guarantee can benefit
from provisions of the agreement.

_Safeguard proceedings_

French insolvency laws provide for a legal regime, the safeguard proceedings, which applies to companies that
experience worse conditions than conciliation proceedings' conditions, but do not reach the level of financial difficulty
required to open judicial reorganization proceedings.

328


-----

A company may initiate safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself; provided it
(i) is able to pay its debts as they fall due out of its available assets, and (ii) experiences difficulties which it is not able to
overcome and which are likely to lead to a cessation des paiements.

If the aforementioned conditions are met, a court-appointed administrator investigates the business of the
company during an initial observation period of six months, renewable once and on very few occasions, twice, and helps
the company draft a safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde).

For large companies (with more than 150 employees or turnover greater than €20 million), two creditors'
committees (one for credit institutions having a claim against the debtor and the other for each supplier having a claim
that represents more than 3% of the total amount of claims of all the debtor's suppliers) will then be established. These
committees will be consulted during the drafting of the safeguard plan by the debtor's management during the
observation period. The committees must announce whether they approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to
30 days of its proposal. The plan must be approved by a super majority vote of each committee, representing at least
two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the voting creditors of each committee. Following approval by the creditors and
bondholders and verification by the court that the interests of all creditors are sufficiently safeguarded, the plan will be
approved by the court. The safeguard plan then becomes binding on all members of the committees, including those who
had voted against it.

With respect to creditors who are not members of the committees, or in the event no committees are established,
proposals are made to each creditor individually. If there are any bondholders, they are presented with the plan during a
general meeting of bondholders held for that purpose.

A company may, in its sole discretion, initiate a "rapid financial safeguard procedure" (procédure de sauvegarde
_financière accélérée) with respect to itself; provided it (i) is engaged in conciliation proceedings and (ii) has drafted a_
plan to ensure the sustainability of the company, which may garner enough support from credit institutions to be adopted
quickly.

_Judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings_

Judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (redressement or liquidation judiciaires) may be initiated
against or by a company if the company cannot pay its debts as they fall due out of its available assets (cessation des
_paiements)._

The company is required to petition for insolvency proceedings or for conciliation proceedings, as described
above, within 45 days of falling into cessation des paiements. If it does not, de jure managers, including directors, and, as
the case may be, de facto managers are subject to civil liability and may be subject to criminal sanctions.

The date of cessation des paiements is deemed to be the date of the court order commencing proceedings, unless
the court sets an earlier date, which may be up to 18 months before the date of the court order. The date of the cessation
_des paiements marks the beginning of a "suspect" or "hardening" period (période suspecte), pursuant to which certain_
transactions entered into during such period may be void or voidable.

Void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the suspect period that may constitute
voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors or protective measures (mesures
_conservatoires). Voidable transactions include any transactions or payments made after the date of cessation des_
_paiements if the party dealing with the company knew that the company was in a state of cessation des paiements._
Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration are also voidable when realized during the six-month
period prior to the beginning of the suspect period.

The court order commencing the proceedings may order either the liquidation or the reorganization of the
company. In the event of reorganization, an administrator appointed by the court investigates the business of the
company during an initial observation period, which lasts six months, renewable once and on very few occasions, twice,
and makes proposals for either (i) the reorganization of the company by helping the debtor draft a reorganization plan,
which is similar to a safeguard plan, as described above, (ii) the sale of the business or (iii) the liquidation of the
company. Committees of creditors may be created under the same conditions as in safeguard proceedings, as described
above. At any time during this observation period, the court can order the liquidation of the company. At the end of the
observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court.

329


-----

_Status of creditors during safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation_
_proceedings_

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of the
proceedings must file a claim with the creditors' representative within two months of the publication of the court order.
This period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. Creditors who have not submitted their
claims during the relevant period are barred from receiving distributions made in accordance with the proceedings.
Employees are not subject to such limits and are preferential creditors under French law.

Subject to limited exceptions, from the date of the court order commencing the proceedings, the company is
prohibited from paying debts outstanding prior to that date, and its creditors may not pursue any legal action against the
company with respect to any claim arising prior to that date. Contractual provisions which would accelerate the payment
of a company's obligations upon the occurrence of (i) the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings or (ii) a state of
_cessation des paiements are not enforceable under French law. The opening of liquidation proceedings, however,_
automatically accelerates the maturity of all of the company's obligations. The administrator may elect to terminate or
continue executory contracts (contrats en cours). If the administrator chooses to continue an executory contract, the
company must fully perform its post-petition contractual obligations.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan or a reorganization plan, claims of creditors who have accepted the plan will
be paid according to the plan. With respect to creditors that have not accepted the proposals made by the administrator
and the company, the court can decide to reschedule the payment of their claims over a maximum period of 10 years. In
relation to the assets which are regarded as essential to the continuation of the debtor's business, the court can determine
a period of time during which such essential assets may not be disposed of without the express authorization of the court.
If the court adopts a "plan of sale of the business" (plan de cession), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated for the
payment of creditors, according to their ranking. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the company, the
court will appoint a liquidator who shall sell the assets of the company and settle the relevant debts.

**_German insolvency law_**

Certain Guarantors, namely NH Central Europe GmbH & Co. KG, NH Hotelbetriebs.-u. Dienstleistungs,
GmbH, NH Hoteles Deutschland GmbH, NH Hotelbetriebs-u Entwicklungs, GmbH and JOLLY HOTELS
DEUTSCHLAND GmbH are incorporated under the laws of Germany in the legal form of either a limited liability
company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) (“GmbH”) or a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) (“KG”)
and have their registered seats and registered offices in Germany. In the event of insolvency, insolvency proceedings
may, therefore, be initiated in Germany if any of the German Guarantors was held to have its center of main interests
within the territory of Germany at the time the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) was filed. German law would then govern those proceedings. There are a number of factors
that are taken into account to ascertain the “center of main interests”, which should correspond to the place where the
company conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third-parties. The
point at which this issue falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened.

German insolvency laws and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung)
may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including in respect of priority of
claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings. Hence, German
insolvency laws may limit the ability of holders of the Notes to receive payments due on the Notes Guarantees to an
extent exceeding any limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the
economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be a separate insolvency proceeding for
each group entity if and to the extent there exists an insolvency situation on the part of the relevant entity. Each of these
insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings, if any, within the group. In
particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and also
no pooling of claims amongst the respective entities of a group. On 21 April 2018, the Bill to Facilitate the Handling of
Group Insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen) entered into force. While the
bill does not abolish the principle of separate insolvency proceedings in relation to each group entity, it provides for the
following four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group
insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity’s insolvency proceeding; (ii) the appointment of a
single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are
imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply

330


-----

for "coordination proceedings" (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a "coordination insolvency
_administrator" (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a "coordination plan" (Koordinationsplan)._

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex
_officio but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Insolvency_
proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of
the debtor or in the event that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit).
According to the German Insolvency Code, a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets
based on liquidation value, unless a continuation of the debtor’s business for the following 12 months is predominantly
likely (positive Fortführungsprognose). If a GmbH becomes illiquid or over-indebted, the managing director(s) of such
company and, in certain circumstances its shareholders, are obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings
without delay but no later than (i) three weeks after the mandatory insolvency situation of illiquidity arose or (ii) six
weeks after the mandatory insolvency situation of over-indebtedness arose. Non-compliance with this obligation exposes
management to both severe damage claims and sanctions under criminal law. The same principles apply to a limited
partnership; provided that its general partner is not a natural person, but, as is the case with NH Central
Europe GmbH & Co. KG, a limited liability company.

In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency situation under German
law, which exists if a company currently is able to service its payment obligations but will presumably not be able to
continue to do so at some point within the following 24 months. However, in case of imminent illiquidity, only the
debtor, and not the creditors, is entitled but not obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Subject to the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act (as defined below) the management of a company
with limited liability company or limited liability partnership has the right, as long as the company is not illiquid
(zahlungsunfähig) or over-indebted (überschuldet) but imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsfähigkeit) has occurred,
to initiate a voluntary preinsolvency restructuring procedure. If the company has commenced a procedure for the
voluntary restructuring under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act, the obligation to file for insolvency is
suspended as long as the restructuring procedure is pending, however, the restructuring court has to be noticed by the
occurrence of such a mandatory insolvency reasons.

The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary
protective measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren).

The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the
debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. As part of such protective measures, the court may appoint a
preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary
insolvency administrator depend on the decision of the court. In particular, the duties may be to safeguard and preserve
the debtor’s property and the ability of the debtor to continue its business, to verify the existence of an insolvency
situation and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings.
The court may also decide to pass the right to manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor to the
preliminary insolvency administrator.

The court may order the preliminary proceedings to be run by the relevant debtor himself if the debtor has
applied for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), under which the debtor’s management generally
remains in charge of administering the debtor’s operations under the supervision of a preliminary custodian (Sachwalter);
provided that the application for debtor-in-possession proceedings is not obviously without merit. A debtor is only
entitled to apply for debtor-in-possession proceedings if it faces over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or imminent
illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), not if it faces illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). Such debtor-in-possession
proceedings remain subject to review and may be repealed, in which case a preliminary insolvency administrator would
be appointed. In particular, the debtor-in-possession proceedings may be revoked if (i) the relevant debtor has substantial
outstanding payments to certain persions, (ii) stabilization orders pursuant to the Company Stabilisation and
Restructuring Act have been filed in the preceding three years or (iii) the relevant debtor has been in breach of any
disclosure obligations within the preceding three years, in each case unless despite these circumstances it is to be
expected that the relevant debtor will be able to align his management with the interests of the creditors.

Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations, the insolvency court may be obliged to appoint a
preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss). The preliminary creditor’s committee will be able to
participate in certain important insolvency court decisions. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following
decisions: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator or an insolvency administrator (vorläufiger

331


-----

_Insolvenzverwalter oder Insolvenzverwalter), orders for “debtor in possession” proceedings (Anordnung der_
_Eigenverwaltung), and appointments of a preliminary custodian (Sachwalter). If the members of the preliminary_
creditors’ committee unanimously agree on a person to serve as preliminary insolvency administrator, insolvency
administrator or custodian, the suggestion is binding on the court unless the suggested individual is not eligible
(i.e., incompetent or not interested). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all
creditor constituencies, the committee shall consist of representatives of the secured creditors, one for the large creditors
and one for the small creditors, and a representative for the employees of the debtor.

The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of main insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes
_Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, in particular if (i) the debtor is facing imminent illiquidity, illiquidity_
or over-indebtedness and (ii) there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the
assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only order the opening of main insolvency
proceedings if third parties, such as creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels
_Masse)._

Upon the opening of main insolvency proceedings, the court usually appoints an insolvency administrator,
usually the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator, unless debtor-in-possession proceedings
(Eigenverwaltung) have been ordered, as described above. In the absence of debtor-in-possession proceedings, the right
to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency
administrator, and the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger)
are entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the first creditors’ assembly (erste
_Gläubigerversammlung) only if (i) a simple majority of votes cast, by persons and amount of insolvency claims, has_
voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual is eligible
to be insolvency administrator (i.e., sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial). The insolvency
administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations. These
new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as preferential claims against the insolvency estate
(Masseverbindlichkeiten), preferred over any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor, including any residual claims of
a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured, wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor must
participate in the insolvency proceedings unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency estate
(Aussonderungsrecht). Any judicial enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the debtor by any of its
creditors is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened and, if so ordered by the court,
with respect to assets other than real estate, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when
insolvency proceedings commence. If, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a
creditor acquires through execution (Zwangsvollstreckung) (i.e., attachment) a security interest in part of the debtor’s
property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law
upon opening of the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors
may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately but can enforce them
only in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code. Accordingly, creditors only having a claim or
guarantee but no asset security may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis
from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Creditors holding asset security are not entitled to
enforce their security interest outside the insolvency proceedings to the extent the German Insolvency Code authorizes
the insolvency administrator to dispose of the relevant collateral, but have only certain preferential rights
(Absonderungsrechte) in the insolvency proceedings.

The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in the debtor’s
possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) and
security by title transfer (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment
agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In the insolvency proceedings, however, creditors secured by asset security have
certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest, entitlement to
enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. If the enforcement right is
vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the
value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten), which, in the
aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds, plus VAT (if any), are disbursed to the creditor
holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims.

With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor, the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors
of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first, including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred

332


-----

liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings. Thereafter, all other
insolvency claims (Insolvenzforderungen), including the claims of creditors not secured by asset security, will be
satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). Hence,
the proceeds resulting from the realization of the insolvency estate of the debtor may not be sufficient to satisfy in full
unsecured creditors of the debtor. In addition, it may take several years until insolvency proceeds, if any, are distributed
to unsecured creditors.

Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied
only after the claims of other non-subordinated creditors, including the unsecured insolvency claims, have been fully
satisfied. The following subordinated claims shall be satisfied after non-subordinated claims in the following order and
according to the proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the
claims of the insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual
insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and
administrative fines, as well as incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offense binding the debtor to
pay money; (iv) claims for a performance to be made gratuitously (unentgeltliche Leistung) by the debtor and (v) claims
for repayment of a shareholder loan or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such
a loan.

While in ordinary insolvency proceedings, the value of the debtor’s assets is realized by a piecemeal sale or, as
the case may be, by a bulk sale of the debtor’s business as a going concern, a different approach aiming at the
rehabilitation of the debtor can be taken based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the
debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of
the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. If the debtor is a
corporate entity, the shares or membership rights in the debtor can be included in the insolvency plan. For example, the
shares or membership rights in the debtor can be transferred to third-parties, including a transfer to creditors based on a
debt-to-equity swap, however, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity conversion if it does not
consent to such debt-to-equity-swap. In general, an insolvency plan is adopted only if all groups of creditors vote in favor
of it. However, a group voting against the insolvency plan may nevertheless be disregarded if (i) the members of the
dissenting group of creditors are not in a worse position under the insolvency plan than the position they would be in if
there were no plan, (ii) they participate in an appropriate manner in the assets made available to the participants under the
insolvency plan and (iii) the majority of all voting groups of creditors voted in favor of the plan.

Moreover, if the debtor has applied for debtor-in-possession proceedings and can prove that a restructuring of its
business is not obviously without merit, the court may grant a period of up to three months to prepare an insolvency plan
under self-administration. During this period, creditors’ rights to enforce security may, upon application of the filing
debtor, be suspended (Schutzschirm). In these circumstances, the insolvency court has to appoint a preliminary custodian
(vorläufiger Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as
preliminary custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is
obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., not competent or impartial). The three-month period for preparing an
insolvency plan will be terminated if, for example, it becomes obvious that the proposed restructuring is without merit or
if the preliminary creditors’ committee applies to the court to bring it to an end.

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon
the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until
the insolvency administrator opts for performance.

On June 20, 2019, the European Parliament and the counsel adopted a new directive (Directive of the European
Parliament and the Council EU 2019/1023 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and
disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and
discharge of debt, and amending directive (EU) 2017/1132 (the "Preventive Restructuring Directive")). The Preventing
Restructuring Directive is not directly applicable in the EU member states but needs to be implemented in national law.
In order to implement the preventive restructuring directive, the Act on a Stabilisation and Restructuring Framework for
Enterprises ("Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act") came into force on January 1, 2021.

The Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act provides for a new framework allowing the stabilization and
restructuring of companies outside and before an insolvency procedure, on the basis of a restructuring plan prepared by
the company in financial crisis. The Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act in particular allows a company that is
in a financial crisis to restructure its debt (as well as any collateral provided for its own debt or for debt of third parties),
including by way of a "hair-cut", by majority decisions of the creditors of the debt to be restructured, subject to judicial
confirmation of the restructuring plan. In addition, the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act provides for a

333


-----

potential court appointment of a restructuring trustee (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) or a restructuring moderator
(Sanierungsmoderator).

The restructuring proceeding is only available in the situation of imminent illiquidity (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit). The relevant debtor can file for debtor-in possession proceeding pursuant to the Company_
Stabilisation and Restructuring Act, in which a restructuring plan will put the creditors of the relevant debtor in voting
classes. A majority of 75% in value can bind a minority within each voting class and the restructuring court has the
power to impose on the restructuring plan in dissenting classes if the majority of all voting classes has voted in favor of
the restructuring plan, no creditor is placed at a disadvantage by the restructuring plan compared with its situation
without such restructuring plan and the members of the relevant voting class participates appropriately in the economic
value of the restructuring plan.

Upon request of the relevant debtor and if necessary to preserve the prospects of achieving the restructuring
goal, the restructuring court may order (i) a stay of execution as a result of which any execution measures against the
relevant debtor will be suspended or discontinued and (ii) a stay of enforcement as a result of which any rights to
moveable assets that might be asserted as a separate satisfaction right or right to segregation in the event of insolvency
proceedings may not be enforced by the creditor and that such assets may be used to continue the relevant debtor's
business (together a "Stabilisation Order"). The maximum period for such Stabilisation Order are eight months.

**_Italian insolvency law_**

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Italy, which does not include
special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorised to carry out certain reserved activities
(except for the description of certain insolvency proceeding to which they may be subject) nor does it provide a
comprehensive description of insolvency laws applicable to public companies.

Italian creditors’ rights and insolvency laws are generally considered to be more favorable to debtors than the
regimes of certain other jurisdictions. In Italy, the courts play a central role in the insolvency process; moreover, the
enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be time consuming. Several recent reforms of Italian insolvency
laws expanded the discipline of restructuring proceedings.

On January 12, 2019, the government enacted a new bankruptcy code implementing the guidelines contained in
Law No. 155 dated October 19, 2017, which enacts a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia,
insolvency matters (so-called “Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency,” the “BCIC” or “Insolvency Code”). The purpose
of the 2019 Reform was mostly (i) to ensure the rationality of the provisions on insolvency, affected over the years by
various amendments (especially in the civil sector) which caused a great degree of legal uncertainty, (ii) to allow early
awareness of the financial distress of a business and (iii) to safeguard the business’ entrepreneurial potential during a
crisis. On February 14, 2019, the Insolvency Code has been published in the official journal. Except for minor changes in
some provisions of the Italian Civil Code (and certain express repeals in the criminal sector) which already entered into
force on March 16, 2019, according to Article 389 of the Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019, the Insolvency
Code will enter into force 18 months following its publication in Italy’s official journal (i.e., August 15, 2020).
Nevertheless, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, such entry into force of the Insolvency Code has been currently
postponed to September 1, 2021, according to Article 5 of the Law Decree No. 23 of April 8, 2020, subject to conversion
in law by the Italian Parliament. Until that date, insolvency proceedings will continue to be governed by Italian
Bankruptcy Law, as in force before.

Under Italian law, the state of insolvency (insolvenza) of a company is ascertained and declared by a court.
Insolvency occurs at a time when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they fall due. This must be
a permanent, and not a temporary, status.

The following restructuring or insolvency remedies and proceedings are available under Italian law for
companies facing financial difficulties or in a state of temporary crisis, and for insolvent companies:

 - out of court debt restructuring plans pursuant to Article 67, paragraph 3(d), of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (piani
_attestato di risanamento);_

 - debt restructuring agreements with creditors pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (accordi di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti);_

 - composition with creditors (concordato preventivo);

334


-----

 - bankruptcy (fallimento) and post-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare);

 - extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 270/99
(amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi imprese in crisi di cui alla Legge Prodi bis);

 - extraordinary administration proceedings for large insolvent companies pursuant to Italian Law Decree
No. 347/2003, as amended (amministrazione straodinaria delle grandi imprese in crisi di cui alla Legge
_Marzano);_

 - compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa).

The primary aim of the Italian Bankruptcy Law used to be to liquidate the debtor’s assets (with the continuation
of the assets as a going-concern (where applicable) only if this would satisfy a creditor’s claim). This competing aim
often has been balanced by the sale of businesses as going-concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along
with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been subsequently amended with a view to
promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed
businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options.

In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial
distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out of court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the
existence of the company, but which are susceptible to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency,
and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. Subject to certain conditions, the company who implements a
_concordato preventivo or accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti may benefit of an automatic stay, preventing all creditors_
from instituting or continuing any proceeding or enforcement against its assets. Furthermore, all the acts, payments and
guarantees over assets of the distressed company executed and/or performed according to a validated (omologato)
_accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti or concordato preventivo are exempt from clawback actions (revocatoria_
_fallimentare) and from certain bankruptcy crimes provided under Articles 216, third paragraph (preferential bankruptcy),_
and 217 (simple bankruptcy) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law in the event of subsequent Bankruptcy.

_Bankruptcy_

Bankruptcy (fallimento) is a court-supervised procedure for the liquidation of an insolvent company’s assets and
for the distribution of the proceeds. It results in the company’s dissolution. A company is declared bankrupt when
insolvent. A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence a bankruptcy proceeding (fallimento) for the judicial
liquidation of a debtor can be made by the same debtor, one or more creditors and, in certain cases, by the public
prosecutor. The bankruptcy is declared by a competent bankruptcy court. Upon the commencement of a bankruptcy
proceeding:

    - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a
defined period;

    - the debtor is dispossessed and the administration of the debtor company and the management of its
assets pass from the debtor company to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare), who manages
and disposes of the assets under the direction of the delegated judge;

    - any act (including payments, pledges and issuances of guarantees) made by the debtor, other than those
made through the receiver, after (and in certain cases before for a limited period of time) a declaration
of bankruptcy with respect to the creditors is (or could be if made before) ineffective;

    - certain payments made, securities given or transactions entered into by the debtor in a certain period
before the debtor’s submission to a bankruptcy procedure (varying from six months to two years) can
be set aside and clawed-back if certain conditions are met (Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law);

    - the beginning of bankruptcy involves the cessation of all the activities of the company with a view to a
sale of all assets. However, the bankruptcy court may order that business operations be continued
whenever cessation could cause greater damage to the company, provided that the continuation does
not adversely affect the creditors of the bankrupt debtor. If the bankruptcy court authorizes the
continuation of the business (esercizio provvisorio dell’impresa del fallito), the management of the
business is entrusted to the bankruptcy receiver (who may in turn avail himself of qualified thirdparties for this purpose); and

335


-----

    - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy
declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over..

The bankruptcy proceeding is carried out and supervised by a court-appointed receiver (curator fallimentare), a
deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee (comitato dei creditori). The receiver is not a representative
of the creditors and the creditors’ committee, as specifically provided for by law, has in some cases authorization power
over the receiver and, in general, consultation functions over the latter and vigilance authority over the bankruptcy
proceedings. The receiver is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor for the satisfaction of creditors. The
proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority. The liquidation of a debtor can take a
considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real property. Italian law provides for
priority to the payment of certain preferential creditors, including the bankruptcy receiver, employees and the Italian
judicial and social security authorities employees and the Italian judicial and social security authorities.

The statutory priority assigned to creditors under Italian law may be different from priorities in the United States
and certain other European jurisdictions. Under Italian law, the claims with super priority (crediti prededucibili) are so
qualified by a specific provision of law or when they arise as part of the bankruptcy (i.e., claims originated in the
insolvency proceedings, such as costs related to the procedure). These claims are paid for the entire amount and before
other claims (secured, preferred, unsecured and subordinated). Examples of these claims are bankruptcy receiver’s fees
and costs. Such claims are satisfied in full (including costs and interests) with the proceeds of the liquidation of movable
and immovable debtor’s assets, according to their rank (preferred, secured, unsecured), with the exclusion of the
proceeds of the sale of assets subject to other creditors’ security interests (mortgages and pledges), which are directed to
payment of secured creditors. Crediti prededucibili are followed by secured creditors with privileges (crediti privilegiati;
a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages (crediti ipotecari)
and pledges (crediti garantiti da pegno) and then unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). In particular, creditors with
mortgages (crediti ipotecari) and pledges (crediti garantiti da pegno) have priority in the distribution of what has been
eventually obtained from the liquidation of assets given as security.

**_Luxembourg insolvency law_**

Some of guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and have their registered offices in the
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (together the “Luxembourg Guarantors”). Accordingly, Luxembourg courts should have,
in principle, jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings with respect to these Luxembourg Guarantors, as entities
having their registered office and central administration (administration centrale) and COMI, as used in the EU
Insolvency Regulation, in the Luxembourg, such proceedings to be governed by Luxembourg insolvency laws.
According to the EU Insolvency Regulation, there is a rebuttable presumption that a company has its COMI in the
jurisdiction in which it has the place of its registered office. As a result, there is a rebuttable presumption that the COMI
of the Luxembourg Guarantors is in Luxembourg and consequently that any “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined
in the EU Insolvency Regulation) would be opened by a Luxembourg court and be governed by Luxembourg law.

Under Luxembourg insolvency laws, the following types of proceedings (the “Insolvency Proceedings”) may be
opened against such Luxembourg Guarantors:

    - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite) as set forth in articles 437 and seq. of the Luxembourg Code of
Commerce (code de commerce), the opening of which is initiated by the relevant guarantor, by any of
its representatives (aveu de faillite), by any of its creditors or by Luxembourg courts ex officio (faillite
_d´eclar´ee d’office—absent a request made by the company or a creditor). The managers/directors of_
the Luxembourg Guarantors have the obligation to file for bankruptcy within one month in case they
are in a state of cessation of payment (cessation de paiement).

Following such a request, the Luxembourg courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings, if the
relevant guarantor (i) is in cessation of payments (cessation des paiements) i.e. the company is unable to pay its debts as
they fall due (dettes certaines, liquids et exigibles) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de
_crédit)._

If a court finds that these conditions are satisfied, it may also open ex officio bankruptcy proceedings, absent a
request made by the relevant Luxembourg Guarantor.

336


-----

The main effects of such proceedings are (i) the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the relevant
Luxembourg Guarantor, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for secured creditors and (ii) the payment of the
Luxembourg Guarantor’s creditors in accordance with their ranking upon the realization of the guarantor’s assets;

    - controlled management proceedings (gestion controlée), the opening of which may only be requested
by the relevant Luxembourg Guarantor and not by its creditors, applying to companies facing financial
difficulties and being considered by the Luxembourg district court sitting in commercial matters to
have real prospects of either (i) reorganizing and restructuring its debts and business or (ii) realizing its
assets in the best interest of its creditors; and

    - composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite), the obtaining of which is requested by the
relevant guarantor only after having received a prior consent from a majority of its creditors holding
75% at least of the claims against such Luxembourg Guarantor and the purpose of whih is to obtain a
restructuring of the company’s liabilities. The obtaining of such composition proceedings will trigger a
provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors.

In addition to these proceedings, the ability of the holders of notes to receive payment on the notes may be
affected by a decision of a Court to grant a stay on payments (sursis de paiement) or to put the relevant guarantor into
judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public
prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the
commercial code or of the Companies Act. The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow
similar rules as those applicable to bankruptcy proceedings.

The Luxembourg Guarantors’ liabilities in respect of the notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the guarantor
following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred
for the purpose of such liquidation) and those of the concerned obligor’s debts that are entitled to priority under
Luxembourg law. For example, preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among others:

    - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue;

    - value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise;

    - social security contributions; and

    - remuneration owed to employees.

For the avoidance of doubt, the above list is not exhaustive.

During insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. In the event of
controlled management proceedings, the ability of secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be limited,
automatically causing the rights of secured creditors to be frozen until a final decision has been taken by the court as to
the petition for controlled management, and may be affected thereafter by a reorganization order given by the relevant
Luxembourg court subject to the exceptions under the Luxembourg law of August 5, 2005 on financial collateral
arrangements, as amended (the “Luxembourg Collateral Law”). A reorganization order requires the prior approval of
more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of the relevant guarantor’s liabilities in order to take effect.
Furthermore, declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of
default) may not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the guarantor
during the period before bankruptcy, the so- called “suspect period” (période suspecte), which is a maximum of six
months, as from the date on which the Commercial Court formally adjudicates a person bankrupt, and, as for specific
payments and transactions, during an additional period of ten days before the commencement of such period preceding
the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect
period at an earlier date, if the bankruptcy judgment was preceded by another insolvency proceedings (e.g., a suspension
of payments or controlled management proceedings) under Luxembourg law.

In particular:

    - pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, specified transactions (such as, in
particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts; the payment of debts which have not
fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other

337


-----

means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of
exchange; the sale of assets or entering into transactions generally without consideration or with
substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the suspect period (or the ten days
preceding it) will be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver;
article 445 does not apply for financial collateral arrangements and set- off arrangements subject to the
Luxembourg Collateral Law, such as Luxembourg law pledges over shares, accounts or receivables.

    - pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured debts for
considerations, as well as other transactions concluded during the suspect period, are subject to
cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded
with the knowledge of the bankrupt’s cessation of payments; article 446 does not apply for financial
collateral arrangements and set-off arrangements subject to the Collateral Law, such as Luxembourg
law pledges over shares, accounts or receivables.

    - regardless of the suspect period, article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and article 1167 of
the Luxembourg Civil Code (action paulienne) give any creditor the right to challenge any fraudulent
payments and transactions made prior to the bankruptcy.

After having converted all available assets of the company into cash and after having determined all the
company’s liabilities, the insolvency receiver will distribute the proceeds of the sale to the creditors further to their
priority ranking as set forth by law, after deduction of the receiver fees and the bankruptcy administration costs.

Any international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management and composition proceedings
may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on
the Luxembourg Co-Issuer’s obligations under the Notes.

**_Mexican insolvency law_**

The applicable Mexican insolvency law is the Mercantile Bankruptcy Law, which determines that an entity is
deemed in bankruptcy where it has generally breached its payment obligations before two or more third-parties, provided
that such liabilities represent 35% or more of its total liabilities, and such liabilities have been due for over 30 days
starting upon the date on which the claim has been filed, and the entity has no assets to secure at least 80% of such due
liabilities.

Once a company has been declared in general payment violation to third-parties, a board of visitors and experts
is appointed to analyze its exact situation, following which bankruptcy could be claimed and filed by the entity or by its
creditors before the District Judge.

Once such procedure is started, creditors shall have to file their claims and documents to provide proof of any
the following: (i) claiming guarantee impounding the assets of the company; or (ii) claiming the insufficiency of assets to
fulfill its obligations. In this case, if the company is found in bankruptcy, the shareholders of the company will be
considered unlimitedly liable for all the company obligations.

Once the procedure is initiated, the judge will request an inspection order by the Ministry of Finance to
determine that the information is equivalent to the one the Ministry has registered. If creditors are satisfied with the
balance, the payments will be determined to each creditor according to its right of claim. Mexican insolvency law
determines the following rank of creditors: (i) Secured creditors; (ii) Privileged creditors; (iii) Tax liabilities; and
(iv) Common creditors.

**_Polish insolvency law_**

_General issues_

The validity and enforcement of the Notes Guarantee provided by the Polish Guarantor may be limited by the
laws relating to bankruptcy, reorganization or other laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of the rights of creditors
in general.

Under article 10 of the Law on Bankruptcy dated February 28, 2003 (Journal of Laws 2020, item 1228) (the
“Bankruptcy Law”), the condition for declaring the debtor's bankruptcy is his insolvency. A debtor is considered
insolvent if he is no longer able to pay his liabilities as they fall due. It is presumed that the loss of the ability to pay due
liabilities takes place if the debtor is delayed in fulfilling such liabilities by more than three months. With respect to

338


-----

debtors being legal persons and unincorporated entities in which a separate law vests legal capacity, a distinct
prerequisite for the declaration of bankruptcy is excessive indebtedness, meaning that liabilities (due and not due) exceed
the value of all the assets of such entity and such situation continues for more than 24 months. Therefore, in order to
enable the Polish Guarantors to grant guarantees securing liabilities of the Issuer without the risk of insolvency of the
Polish Guarantor, the Notes Guarantee shall contain “limitation language” pursuant to which, the liability under the
Notes Guarantee granted by the Polish Guarantor will be limited up to the value of all assets owned by the Polish
Guarantor.

Since January 1, 2016, the Bankruptcy Law only contains provisions on insolvency. The Bankruptcy Law is
applicable only in case of bankruptcy connected with the liquidation of the assets of the debtor (“bankruptcy”).

An alternative solution may be restructuring proceedings, regulated in a separate legal act, i.e. in the Law on
Restructuring dated May 15, 2015 (Journal of Laws 2020, item 814) (the “Restructuring Law”). The restructuring
proceedings may be conducted against an insolvent debtor or a debtor threatened by insolvency. The Restructuring Law
understands the state of insolvency in the same way as the Bankruptcy Law, indicating that “insolvent debtor” shall mean
the insolvent debtor as defined in the Bankruptcy Law. On the other hand, debtor is considered to be at risk of insolvency
if his economic situation indicates that he may become insolvent in short time.

The purpose of the restructuring proceedings is to avoid declaration of bankruptcy of a debtor through enabling
him to undergo restructuring by making an arrangement with creditors and, in the case of remedial proceedings, also
through conducting remedial actions, while securing legitimate rights of creditors. Following the Restructuring Law, it is
possible that by means of an arrangement, creditors will be satisfied to a greater extent than as a result of bankruptcy.
Arrangement proceedings enable the debtor to make an arrangement after the preparation and approval of the inventory
of receivable debts (the “arrangement proceedings”). However, the Restructuring Law introduces three other
restructuring proceedings: proceedings for the approval of arrangement, in which the debtor independently negotiates and
enters into an arrangement with its creditors, subject to the court’s approval (the “proceedings for the approval of
arrangement”), accelerated arrangement proceedings in which the arrangement is concluded at the meeting of creditors
called by the court and which are intended to be quicker that the standard arrangement proceedings (the “accelerated
arrangement proceedings”) and remedial proceedings aimed at advanced restructuring of the debtor’s enterprise (the
“remedial proceedings”).

The declaration of bankruptcy gives rise to a number of consequences both for the bankrupt entity itself and its
creditors. These consequences affect the bankrupt entity, its assets and liabilities, as well as any pending proceedings.

According to the Bankruptcy Law the provisions in agreements or contracts which stipulate that in the event of
bankruptcy the legal relationship to which the bankrupt entity is a party is to be amended or terminated are legally
invalid.

Where a declaration of bankruptcy has been issued, court, administrative, as well as court and administrative
proceedings in respect of the bankruptcy estate may be instituted and continued by no other than the bankruptcy trustee,
or against him. Proceedings instituted against the bankrupt before the date of declaration of bankruptcy for a claim that is
subject to notification to the bankruptcy estate, may be taken against the trustee only if, in bankruptcy proceedings, the
claim, after exhausting the prescribed procedure, is not included in the list receivables. If court proceedings are pending,
then when the one of the participants is declared bankrupt, such proceedings are suspended by operation of law. All of
these consequences of a declaration of bankruptcy also apply to arbitration proceedings. Additionally, if arbitration is not
commenced on the date of declaration of bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee may, with the judge-commissioner’s
(managing the course of the proceedings) permission, withdraw from the arbitration clause if the assertion of a claim
before the arbitration court hinders the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate, and in particular if the latter’s condition
makes it impossible to cover the costs of initiating and continuing arbitration. The withdrawal shall cause the arbitration
clause to lose its legal effect.

To be able to participate in bankruptcy proceedings, the bankrupt entity’s creditors should file their claims
against the bankrupt with the judge-commissioner within the time limit set down in the declaration of bankruptcy in order
to have them included in the list of claims. Only claims recorded in public registers are automatically (ex officio) placed
on such a list. Upon the lapse of the time limit set for notification of claims, the trustee, court supervisor or administrator
verifies the claims and draws up a list.

Under the Bankruptcy Law, any debt payable in a currency other than Polish zloty (e.g. euro or $) if being put
on the list of debts must be converted into Polish zloty at the National Bank of Poland’s average exchange rate prevailing
on the date the bankruptcy court issues a decision on the debtor’s bankruptcy. Accordingly, in the event of a bankruptcy

339


-----

of the Polish debtor, creditor may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date of bankruptcy and the date of receipt
of any amounts following a bankruptcy proceeding.

After examining the objections, which may be lodged by the creditors, the judge-commissioner approves the list
of claims. The list of claims drawn up in accordance with the above-described procedure constitutes the basis for
participation in the bankruptcy proceedings; an extract from the list serves as a writ of enforcement against the bankrupt
entity upon discontinuance or completion of the bankruptcy proceedings.

_Arrangement proceeding_

Under the Restructuring Law, the arrangement generally covers all the claims against the bankrupt entity that
arose prior to the date of announcing bankruptcy, save for, inter alia, pension and/or disability and sickness insurance
contributions, claims arising out of employment relationships and claims secured on the debtor’s property by a mortgage,
pledge or registered pledge, to the extent covered by the value of the object of security, unless the creditor expressed
consent for covering such claim by the arrangement..

Arrangement proposals may provide for the division of creditors into groups covering individual categories of
interests, in particular: (i) creditors who are entitled to claims under employment relationships and who expressed
consent for covering them by the arrangement; (ii) farmers who are entitled to claims under contracts for delivering
products from their own agricultural farms; (iii) creditors whose claims are secured on components of the debtor’s assets
with a mortgage, pledge, registered pledge, Treasury pledge or ship’s mortgage, as well as by transfer to the creditor of
ownership of a thing, receivable debt or another right and who expressed consent for covering them by the arrangement;
(iv) creditors being shareholders of a debtor that is a company and holding company shares ensuring at least 5 per cent of
votes at the meeting of shareholders or the general meeting of shareholders, even if they are entitled to claims mentioned
in points (i) to (iii) above.

The terms and conditions of restructuring the bankrupt entity’s liabilities and obligations that are set down in the
proposed arrangement agreements should be identical for all the creditors or, if the voting on the arrangement is to take
place in groups of creditors, identical for the creditors included in the same group, unless the creditor expressly consents
to less favorable conditions. The Restructuring Law does not contain a limited list of methods of restructuring the
bankrupt entity’s liabilities and obligations. Among the examples of such methods is the extension of the deadline for
performance of liabilities or obligations, consent to repay debts in instalments, reduction of debts, conversion of debts
into shares, and amending, exchanging or repealing the security securing the specific debt. Arrangement proceedings
may also be conducted through the liquidation of the bankrupt entity’s assets, for example by the creditor taking over
such assets.

An arrangement agreement is approved by the creditors’ meeting. The arrangement may be concluded if at least
1/5 of the creditors entitled to vote on the arrangement attend the meeting. The arrangement will be adopted if the
majority of the voting creditors who have cast a valid vote are in favor of it. The majority of creditors voting in favor of
the arrangement must also have at least 2/3 of the sum of claims due to voting creditors.. The approved arrangement
agreement is then submitted for approval to the court. The decision the court issues in that respect is appealable. The
execution of the arrangement agreement concludes the proceedings.

_The arrangement agreement reached through this procedure is binding upon all the creditors whose claims arose prior_
_to the declaration of bankruptcy, regardless of whether they have filed their claims in the bankruptcy proceedings, or not._
_This does not apply to the creditors to whom the bankrupt entity intentionally failed to disclose and who did not_
_participate in the proceedings. In the event that no arrangement agreement is reached, the court discontinues the_
_arrangement bankruptcy proceedings and initiates liquidation proceedings and appoints a bankruptcy trustee._
_Re-opening of the arrangement bankruptcy proceedings is not possible._

_Bankruptcy_

In the case of the declaration of the bankruptcy the creditors may be satisfied and repaid only according to the
rules provided for under the Bankruptcy Law. The bankrupt entity's monetary liabilities that are not yet due become
payable. Non-monetary financial liabilities are converted into monetary liabilities that become payable on the date
bankruptcy is announced. However, in the case of the guarantee (poręczenie) the creditor will be entitled to receive any
amount from the bankruptcy estate only if the underlying obligations are due and payable.

Within the bankruptcy creditors whose claims are secured by a limited right in property to an asset
(i.e. mortgage, pledge) are treated in preferential way during the bankruptcy proceedings. The pledgee of a registered
pledge established on an asset of the bankruptcy estate may satisfy its claims through takeover of such an asset or

340


-----

through sale by public auction, if the pledge agreement so provides. However, the judge-commissioner, at the request of
the trustee, deems ineffective the burden of the bankrupt's assets with a mortgage, lien, registered pledge or sea mortgage,
if the bankrupt was not a personal debtor of the secured creditor, and this burden was established within one year before
the date of submitting the application for announcement bankruptcy and in connection with its establishment, the
bankrupt did not receive any benefits. The same applies if an encumbrance was created in exchange for a performance
incommensurately low in relation to the value of the security given. In the event the bankrupt entity’s estate was
encumbered to secure the debts of the bankrupt entity’s relatives or associated companies, such encumbrance is legally
ineffective regardless of the value of the consideration received by the bankrupt entity, unless the other party shows that
no damage has been inflicted thus on the creditors. In respect of the above, an action to the court may be brought by the
trustee, court supervisor or receiver.

All the creditors whose claims are secured by a limited right in property to an asset included in the bankruptcy
estate enjoy the right of priority in being satisfied from the amounts obtained from the liquidation of such assets
irrespective of the plan of distribution of the funds of the bankruptcy estate. Any surplus that remains after such claims
are satisfied is transferred to the funds in order to be distributed among the other shareholders.

The funds of the bankruptcy estate are composed of the amounts obtained from the liquidation of the bankruptcy
estate or lease of the bankrupt business, as well as interest on those sums deposited in the bank. Once the
judge-commissioner approves the list of claims, the receiver prepares the plan of distribution of such funds. Then the
plan is submitted to the judge-commissioner who can amend or supplement it. The plan can be objected to within two
weeks from the date of its announcement. All objections are examined by the judge-commissioner whose decision in this
respect can be objected to in the court. If no objections are made against the plan or if, upon the examination of the plan,
it has been corrected, the plan is then executed. The creditors are divided into four categories and the claims under a
subsequent category can be satisfied only after claims in the preceding category are fully satisfied.

These categories are as follows:

(i) the first category - receivables under employment relationships attributable to the period prior to the
declaration of bankruptcy, save for claims for remuneration of the bankrupt's representative or
remuneration of the person performing acts connected with administration or supervision over the
bankrupt's enterprise, receivables of farmers under agreements for providing produce from their own
agricultural farms, dues under maintenance and alimonies and pensions by way of indemnity for
causing an illness, incapacity to work, disability or death and pension by way of conversion of rights
covered by the substance of the right to annuity into a pension for life, social insurance premiums
within the meaning of the Act of 13 October 1998 on Social Insurance System due for the last three
years before the declaration of bankruptcy, as well as receivables arisen in the course of restructuring
proceedings due to actions of the receiver, or receivables arisen due to actions of the debtor taken after
the opening of restructuring proceedings, which actions did not require permission of the committee of
creditors or consent of the court supervisor, or which were taken with permission of the committee of
creditors or consent of the court supervisor if bankruptcy was declared after examination of a
simplified bankruptcy petition, as well as receivables under credits, loans, bonds, guarantees or letters
of credit, or other financing provided for in the arrangement adopted in the course of restructuring
proceedings and granted in connection with the performance of the said arrangement if bankruptcy was
declared after examination of the bankruptcy petition filed no later than three months after the
arrangement was validly set aside;

(ii) the second category - other receivables if they are not subject to satisfaction in other categories, in
particular taxes and other public tributes, and the remaining receivables under social insurance
premiums;

(iii) the third category - interest on receivables included in higher categories in the order in which the
principal is subject to satisfaction, as well as judicial and administrative penalties of fine and
receivables in respect of donations and legacies;

(iv) the fourth category - receivables of shareholders under a loan or another act in law of similar effects, in
particular supply of goods with deferred due date made to the bankrupt being a company in the period
of five years before the declaration of bankruptcy, along with interest.

Generally, if it is not possible to satisfy all claims from a given category, they are satisfied in proportion to the
amount of each one of them.

_Invalidity of the bankrupt entity's actions_

Apart from the cases mentioned above, in which the security on the debtor's property will be considered
ineffective, the following actions performed with respect to the bankrupt entity’s assets are legally ineffective against the
bankrupt entity under the Bankruptcy Law:

    - acts in law whereby the bankrupt exercised control of his assets, performed by the bankrupt within one
year before the filing of the bankruptcy petition, provided that such acts were performed gratuitously,
or for a consideration but with the value of the bankrupt’s performance being drastically in excess of
that received by the bankrupt, or of that reserved for the bankrupt or for a third party; or

    - security and the payment of an unenforceable debt, given or made by the bankrupt within six months
before the filing of the bankruptcy petition; however, one who received the payment or the security
may, by bringing an action or charge, seek the recognition of such acts as effective if at the time when
the same were performed he was unaware of the existence of grounds for the declaration of bankruptcy.

Additionally, the judge-commissioner acting ex officio or on motion of the trustee pronounces legal actions
performed by the bankrupt entity on a fee basis, within six months preceding the date of filing a bankruptcy petition, with
the bankrupt entity’s related parties (i.e., in the case of a bankrupt entity being an individual: with his/her family
members; and in the case of a bankrupt entity being a company or a legal person: with its shareholders, commercial
representatives or their spouses, its affiliated companies or their shareholders, commercial representatives or their
spouses, its parent company or subsidiary company), without effect on the bankruptcy estate unless the other party to the
act shows that no damage has been inflicted thus on the creditors.

**_Portuguese insolvency law_**

The Insolvency and Enterprise Rescue Code (the “CIRE”) was approved by Decree-Law 53/2004, of March 18,
and has been subject to several amendments, the most important of which by Decree-Law 16/2012, of April 20. The first
version of the CIRE eliminated the previous two-part model that admitted two separate types of proceedings: enterprise
or company rescue versus bankruptcy or liquidation. However, Decree-Law 16/2012 has created a preliminary phase
(Processo Especial de Revitalização) (“PER”) with the aim of reaching an agreement between the company and all or
some of its creditors that will pave the way for a viable recovery.

The revitalization process is available only for companies that are experiencing economic difficulties (i.e.,
imminent solvency) and having serious difficulties fulfilling their obligations. The process is simplified, with short
deadlines, and begins with acceptance of at least one of the debtor's creditors. If agreed between the company and the
creditor, the action is presented to a judge. After the publication of the decision of the judge to order the action, all the
debtor's creditors have a designated period of time during which to file their claim against the debtor. After publication of
the list of claims, there is a short period for an appeal, after which period and after resolving any appeals, the judge
publishes the final list.

The revitalization plan is approved if (i) the plan is voted by one-third of the total claims entitled to vote, and a
supermajority of two thirds of the total votes cast, more than half of which are not subordinated credits, not taking
abstentions into account, approves the plan or (ii) the plan is approved by half of the total claims entitled to vote, more
than half of which are not subordinated credits, not taking abstentions into account. The judge then has to approve the
revitalization plan, which would apply to all creditors, including those who did not participate in the approval process.

With the application for the PER, any pending judicial procedures against the company are suspended
immediately. Unless expressly agreed otherwise, with the approval of the revitalization plan, all judicial procedures
against the company are canceled, and creditors are prohibited from initiating any new procedures against the company.

_Insolvency procedure_

According to Portuguese law, a company is insolvent if it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due (cash flow
test) or if the value of the company's assets is significantly less than the amount of its liabilities (balance sheet test).

A company can enter the insolvency process if it is insolvent or its insolvency is imminent. Under imminent
insolvency, only the company can file for insolvency, not its creditors.

342


-----

_Requirements_

Insolvency proceedings can be initiated when any of the following events occurs:

(a) general suspension of payment of debts due for settlement;

(b) failure to comply with one or more obligations which, by virtue of their size or the circumstances of the failure,
show that the debtor is generally unable to meet its obligations as they fall due;

(c) the disappearance of the company's owner or the debtor's directors or the act of abandoning the head office or
main center of activity as a result of the debtor's insolvency and without the designation of a suitable
replacement;

(d) the dissipation, abandonment, hasty or grossly uneconomic liquidation of assets and the creation of fictitious
claims;

(e) the lack of adequate assets to secure payment of the claimant's debt as adjudged in enforcement proceedings
brought against the debtor;

(f) failure to comply with obligations contained in an insolvency or repayment plan approved by creditors in
insolvency proceedings already under way;

(g) general failure, in the previous six months, to pay debts in respect of tax and social security payments and
contributions; debts arising from an employment contract or from the breach or termination of such a contract or
rental payments for any type of hire, including financial leases, installments of a purchase price or loan
repayments secured by a mortgage on the debtor's business premises, head office or residence; or

(h) a clear excess of liabilities over assets in the latest approved balance sheet or a delay of more than nine months
in approving and filing accounts, where a legal obligation to do so exists.

Portuguese law does not specifically provide for the situation of insolvency of a company within a group. There
is no rule establishing any particular effect that a declaration of insolvency may have on an insolvent company's affiliate.

Accordingly, the declaration of insolvency will not, by itself and as a direct consequence, result in the
declaration of insolvency of other companies that are in the same group as the insolvent company. Each company within
the group of an insolvent company will be treated for insolvency purposes as a separate legal entity, and the declaration
of insolvency of any other group company would only occur in the context of a separate insolvency proceeding, requiring
assessment and made on an individual basis as to whether the assets of the company are sufficient to meet its liabilities.

Any creditor, the district attorney or any third party legally responsible for the company's debts can request the
court to declare the insolvency of a company, based on facts that show the company is insolvent. When it is the company
itself that files for insolvency, the court will declare the insolvency within three weekdays unless there is any formal
insufficiency of the filing. When the insolvency is requested by a creditor, the company is summoned and may present its
defense. The Court will decide, based on the evidence submitted by both parties, whether to declare the company
insolvent.

The competent court for the insolvency procedure is the court of the head office of the company or the court of
the location of the debtor's principal interests (i.e., the location where the debtor administers the company, "habitually
and recognizably by third parties").

_Effects_

Once insolvency is declared, the creditor that requested it cannot cancel its request. If the court deems the
request as purposely filed despite the absence of any grounds, the requestor is liable for any damages caused to the
company and its creditors.

Unless stipulated otherwise, the estate of an insolvent party comprises all the debtor's assets on the date of
declaration of insolvency by the court, together with assets and rights acquired by the debtor while proceedings are
pending. Non-attachable assets only form part of the estate if the debtor proffers them voluntarily and if their
non-attachable quality is not absolute.

343


-----

Prior to the insolvency declaration, a creditor may request the appointment of a provisional administrator in
order to prevent any prejudicial acts to the company's assets. In the insolvency declaration, the judge will appoint an
insolvency administrator, which will be responsible for the liquidation of the company's assets, unless an insolvency plan
is approved that provides for the recovery of the company.

The declaration of insolvency causes all the obligations of the insolvent party which are not subject to a
condition precedent to become due for settlement. Creditors cannot enforce their rights outside of the insolvency
procedure. This means that any enforcement procedure that is ongoing at the start of the insolvency procedure will be
stayed.

The law draws a distinction between the insolvency debts and the debts of the estate. The former are claims on
the insolvent party which arose prior to the declaration of insolvency. Claims that the creditor can prove to have arisen
during the procedure are treated in the same way. Debts of the estate are those created during the process, and include,
for example, the cost of the proceedings and the administrator's remuneration.

The declaration of insolvency also deprives the debtor immediately, either directly or through his directors, of
the power to administer and dispose of the assets making up the estate. With effect from the moment of the declaration of
insolvency, those powers are vested in the administrator, who becomes the debtor's representative for all financial matters
relating to the insolvency. As a rule, acts undertaken by the insolvent party in breach of this arrangement are ineffectual.

_Creditors_

The ranking of the creditors is as follows:

(1) Insolvency process expenses, including, for example, insolvency administrator remuneration and court fees and
debts incurred after the insolvency declaration;

(2) Specific preferential claim, meaning those preferential claims that are specific to an asset; for example,
employees' credits have a prevailing security over the real estate property where they work;

(3) Secured creditors;

(4) General preferential credits, meaning preferential credits that are not specific to an asset; for example, social
security credits;

(5) Unsecured creditors;

(6) Subordinated creditors; and

(7) Shareholders.

Under the current Portuguese Insolvency Law, the beneficiaries of any guarantee given by a Portuguese
company will be considered subordinated creditors.

_Claw back_

There is no claw back date by operation of law. The CIRE empowers the Insolvency Administrator to, in its
discretion and for the benefit of the insolvent estate, pursue the invalidation of all acts undertaken or omitted within the
four years prior to the date of the onset of the insolvency proceedings if they diminish, frustrate, hinder, threaten or delay
the settlement of creditors' claims. In general, such transactions may be made void only if it is shown that they were
prejudicial to the insolvency creditors and that the third parties acted in bad faith, meaning the third parties involved had
knowledge that the company was insolvent or that the transaction was prejudicial to the company's creditors.

Some types of transactions can always be challenged, independently of any proof of bad faith of the third party
involved. These include, for example:

    - Gratuitous acts made in the two years prior to the commencement of the insolvency process;

    - Transactions on terms where the company receives consideration that has a value significantly less than
the value of the consideration provided by the insolvent company; and

344


-----

    - Security interests over the insolvent company's assets granted in the six months prior to the
commencement of the insolvency process to secure pre-existing debts.

In Portugal, directors may be held liable (i.e., civil liability, criminal liability or disqualification) for continuing
to trade while a company is in financial difficulty.

_Responsibility_

The directors of a company that is insolvent are obliged to file for insolvency within 30 days of the date the
insolvency situation arises. If the directors do not comply with such obligation, they may be considered responsible for
the insolvency of the company and subject to:

    - disqualification from administration of its own assets for a period of two to 10 years;

    - disqualification from any type of commercial activity, including filling any type of office at any
company for a period of two to 10 years;

    - civil liability for damages the company suffered as a consequence of their actions; or

    - criminal liability for fraudulent bankruptcy, which may be punished by up to five years' imprisonment.

**_Romanian insolvency law_**

Law no. 85/2014 regarding the procedures of insolvency prevention and the insolvency procedure ("the
Romanian Insolvency Law") serves as the general legislation applicable to all economic operators on insolvency related
matters. The legislation entered into force on June 28, 2014. It also contains provisions in the field of pre-insolvency
proceedings as well as the cross- border insolvency.

_Pre-insolvency proceedings_

The Romanian legislation provides for two optional procedures for distressed undertakings by giving the
opportunity to safeguard their activity by resorting to mechanisms and amiable procedures of renegotiating their debts
outside the judicial insolvency procedure, namely the ad-hoc mandate and the compromise proceeding.

The ad-hoc mandate is an amicable settlement proceeding supervised by an ad-hoc proxy appointed by the
court. The procedure is initiated by companies facing financial difficulties, without being insolvent. Distressed
companies ask the court to appoint an ad-hoc proxy which has the task of making the debtor and one or more of its
creditors reach an agreement with the view of overcoming the difficulties the debtor faces. It is a confidential and short
procedure (lasting not more than 90 days). Its purpose is safeguarding the distressed undertaking with the view of
maintaining its activity, the jobs and covering the debts of the respective undertaking.

The compromise proceeding is an amicable settlement proceeding which is to a certain extent similar to the
reorganization during the insolvency procedure. The procedure is initiated by the undertakings facing financial
difficulties, without being insolvent, which observe certain conditions related to their overall worthiness, some of these
conditions being similar to the ones applicable in case of debtors for whom a reorganization plan may be proposed.
Distressed undertaking asks the court to appoint a conciliator which collaborates with the debtor in order to elaborate a
concordat offer, which includes a concordat project and a redressing plan. The conciliator may resort to the
acknowledgement of the compromise by the syndic judge. As of the respective acknowledgement, all the forced
execution procedures against the debtor are suspended. Its purpose is also safeguarding the distressed undertaking with
the view of maintaining its activity, preserving the jobs and covering the debts of the respective undertaking.

_Insolvency proceedings (judicial procedures)_

The insolvency procedure may be requested only by a creditor having a receivable that is certain, liquid in an
amount exceeding 50,000 Lei (approximately €10,000) and due for more than 60 days, or by the debtor which is under
insolvency state for more than 30 days and its outstanding debts exceed 50,000 Lei. Failure of the debtor’s representative
to observe such an obligation, for more than 6 months as of the mentioned term is qualified as criminal offence. The
purpose of the insolvency procedure is the settlement of insolvent debtor’s liabilities (both through the debtor’s
reorganization or liquidation of its patrimony). Two types of proceedings may apply: insolvency proceeding or
bankruptcy.(a) _Implications of an insolvency proceeding against a Romanian compan Law no. 85/2014 regarding the_

purpose of the insolvency procedure is the settlement of insolvent debtor’s liabilities (both through the debtor’s

bankruptcy.

(a) _Implications of an insolvency proceeding against a Romanian company_

A judicial administrator shall be appointed by court and shall either manage the activity of the debtor (in case
where the management right of the debtor was suppressed by court) or simply supervise the debtor's activity (in case
where the debtor preserves the management power).

Upon the opening of insolvency procedure, the debtor, the judicial administrator or one or more creditor(s)
holding at least 20% of the total value of the receivables against the insolvent company may propose a reorganization
plan.

The plan shall be confirmed by the court in the following situations:

    - In case there are 5 classes of receivables, the plan is considered approved if at least 3 classes of
receivables accept the plan, with the condition that at least one of the disadvantaged classes receivables
for which the plan provides one of the following modifications: (i) a reduction of the amount of the
receivable and/or of the accessories to which the creditor is entitled or (ii) a reduction of securities or a
rescheduling of payments without the creditor's express consent and the creditors representing at least
30% of the total amount of claims registered in the creditors' table accepts the plan;

    - In the case there are 3 classes of creditors, the plan is considered accepted if at least 2 classes of
receivables accept the plan, with the condition that at least one of the disadvantaged classes and the
creditors representing at least 30% of the total amount of claims registered in the creditors' table
accepts the plan;

-----

    - In case there are 2 or 4 classes of receivables, the plan is considered accepted if at least half of the half
the number of classes accept the plan, with the condition that at least one of the disadvantaged classes
and the creditors representing at least 30% of the total amount of claims registered in the creditors'
table accepts the plan.

The maximum duration of the reorganization plan is 3 years, (with a possible extension of up to 1 year), during
which the activity of the debtor shall be managed by the debtor itself under the supervision of the judicial administrator,
unless the debtor’s right to manage its business is withdrawn by the court.

(b) _Implications of a bankruptcy proceeding against a Romanian company_

Such a proceeding may be initiated by court in the case that (i) the reorganization plan is not successful, (ii) a
reorganization plan was not submitted in court at all or although submitted it was not approved by creditors/confirmed by
court, (iii) in case of specific situations (e.g., lack of headquarters, lack of legal representative etc.), at the request of the
debtor/creditor or as assessed by the court. A liquidator is appointed by court with the purpose to liquidate debtor’s
patrimony. Upon completion of the liquidation the debtor shall be de-registered from the Trade Registry.

_Other comments relevant for insolvency proceedings_

As of the date of opening of the insolvency proceedings, any and all enforcement, legal or other proceedings for
recovery of claims against the debtor or its assets, are suspended by law. The insolvency law provides for the possibility
of a secured creditor whose enforcement actions have been suspended to ask the syndic judge to resume the foreclosure
with respect to its receivables as well as immediate capitalization of the asset in the insolvency procedure, subject to
certain conditions provided by law. As the Romanian subsidiary (NH Management Black Sea S.R.L.) shall be a personal
guarantor under the Notes and the Senior Secured RCF, the creditors thereunder are unsecured creditors in the meaning
of the Romanian Insolvency Law.

In case of bankruptcy of a Romanian debtor, unsecured creditors rank in the order of payments of the claims
against the bankrupt company, after procedural expenses, payments to creditors committee members (if applicable),
employment claims, claims resulted from continuation of the debtor's activity after opening of the procedure, certain
contracting parties, good faith third party acquirers of assets returned to the bankrupt estate, State budget claims, claims
based on subsistence obligations, claims under bank loans (including interest and expenses), other claims resulting from
product deliveries, service supplies or other works.

Foreign creditors benefit of the same rights as Romanian creditors with respect to opening and participating to
insolvency proceedings governed by Romanian law.

Notwithstanding any contractual agreements made by the parties with respect to payments order, in case that a
Romanian company is subject to bankruptcy, such agreements may be unenforceable against such company, be set aside
in the bankruptcy proceedings and instead the rules set out by the Romanian Insolvency Law will be applied by the
insolvency officials.

**_Spanish insolvency law_**

The Issuer and some of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Spain and will guarantee certain
obligations under the Notes. Under the current Royal Legislative Decree 1/2020 approving the consolidated text of the
Insolvency Law, which entered into force recently on September 1, 2020 (the "Spanish Insolvency Law"), a debtor is
considered insolvent when it cannot comply with its due and payable obligations on a regular basis (insolvencia actual).
A debtor must file for insolvency within two months of the date when such petitioner becomes aware, or should have
become aware, of its insolvency (unless the company has made a pre-insolvency filing in accordance with Article 583 et.
seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law, in which case the debtor will have three months additional grace period to reach an
agreement with its creditors which enable it to overcome the insolvency, and one more to file for insolvency). This legal
duty to file for insolvency has been legally suspended until December 31, 2021 (even if a pre-insolvency notice was
filed) so that the two months period to file for insolvency will start by then. A debtor may also file for insolvency when it
expects that it will be unable to comply with its due obligations on a regular and timely manner (insolvencia inminente).
In addition, under certain circumstances established in the Spanish Insolvency Law, the declaration of insolvency of a
debtor may be requested by any creditor thereof (creditor' petitions for the debtor insolvency filed since March 14, 2020
shall be not admitted for process until December 31, 2021). If filed by the debtor, the insolvency is deemed "voluntary"
(concurso voluntario) and, if filed by a third party, the insolvency is deemed "mandatory" (concurso necesario). The
petition for declaration of insolvency shall be filed before the Commercial Court of the province where the debtor has its
"center of main interest" in Spain. The time between the petition and the insolvency declaration by the court will depend

347


-----

upon a number of factors, including, among others, whether the filing has been made by the debtor or the creditor (and, in
turn, whether the debtor has challenged the petition made by the creditor or certain grounds alleged by the creditor to file
for the debtor's insolvency), whether all appropriate documentation has been submitted on a timely basis or is
incomplete, and the workload of the court. Upon the declaration of the debtor's insolvency, the Court will appoint one
insolvency administrator (administrador concursal), although sometimes a second insolvency administrator can be also
appointed if it is in the public interest.

Creditors may apply for a joint insolvency declaration of two or more of its debtors if either (i) there is a
confusion of assets among them, or (ii) they form part of the same group of companies. Therefore, the request for the
joint insolvency of two or more legal entities may only be filed by a common creditor of the relevant companies and each
of the affected companies must in fact be separately insolvent. Joint insolvency may also be requested by the companies
themselves; provided that they form part of the same group.

Any of the insolvent debtors, or any of the appointed insolvency administrators, as the case may be, may apply
for the accumulation of insolvency proceedings already declared under certain circumstances (and, in particular, if the
insolvent debtors form part of the same group of companies). In addition, creditors may apply for the accumulation of the
insolvency proceedings of two or more of its debtors already declared if either (i) there is a confusion of assets among
them, (ii) they form part of the same group of companies, or (iii) they are managers, shareholders, partners or members
personally liable for the debts of the debtor if it is a legal entity; provided that a petition has not been submitted by any of
the insolvent debtors or by the insolvency administrators.

Insolvency proceedings declared jointly or accumulated are processed in a coordinated manner, without
consolidation of the estate of the insolvent debtors. As a result, and as a general rule, "group insolvency" does not lead to
a commingling of the debtors' assets and creditors of such group. This means that the creditors of one company of the
group will not have recourse against other companies of the same group (except where cross-guarantees exist). The
current system is basically a procedural one, aimed at making the insolvency proceedings as time and cost efficient as
possible as well as allowing for approval of the composition agreements hypothetically submitted to be reciprocally
conditioned on the approval of the others. However, exceptionally, assets and liabilities amongst the companies declared
insolvent may be consolidated where there is a confusion of estates, and the assets and liabilities belonging to each of the
companies cannot be identified, without incurring on unjustified costs or delays.

The Spanish Insolvency Law establishes a single insolvency procedure (concurso), applied to any insolvent
debtor, which includes a common phase (during which, among others, insolvency administrators are appointed, an
inventory of the assets and a list of creditors is prepared and subject to challenge and claims ranked) and two potential
results: (i) a composition agreement between the creditors and the debtor ("CVA") or (ii) the debtor's liquidation.

In the case of voluntary insolvency, as a general rule unless the Court decides otherwise, the debtor retains the
management and powers of disposal over its assets, although it is subject to the intervention (intervención) of the
insolvency administrator, who consequently must approve any management or disposal decision. In the case of
mandatory insolvency, as a general rule unless the Court decides otherwise, the debtor's management powers are
suspended, and management's former powers, including the power to dispose of assets, are conferred solely upon the
insolvency administrator (sustitución). This notwithstanding, as a general rule, any sale or encumbrance of the debtor's
assets or rights before the approval of a CVA or the opening of the liquidation phase requires specific authorization from
the Court. There are certain exceptions to this rule including, among other, transactions in the ordinary course of
business, or transactions essential to assure the viability of the company or its treasury needs required by the continuation
of the insolvency.

There is no automatic claw back date by operation of law. Therefore, there are no prior transactions that
automatically become void as a result of the initiation of insolvency proceedings. Instead the insolvency administrator
must expressly challenge those transactions, to the extent they were detrimental to the debtor's estate and were executed
during the two years before the insolvency is declared. In addition, creditors who have applied to exercise any claw back
action (stating the specific action they aim to contest or revoke and the grounds of their petition) shall be entitled to
exercise such action if the insolvency administrator does not do so within the two months following their request. Under
the current Spanish Insolvency Law, upon declaration of insolvency, acts detrimental (perjudiciales) to the debtor's estate
carried out by the debtor during the two years prior to the date the insolvency is declared may be rescinded, even in the
absence of fraudulent intent or link to the insolvency (transactions taking place earlier than two years before the
declaration of insolvency may be challenged under the general applicable regime, under which fraud is required, among
other things). Article 227 of the Spanish Insolvency Law contains an irrefutable presumption that those acts where no
consideration is received for a disposed asset and acts that result in the early repayment or settlement of obligations
which would have become due after the declaration of insolvency (unless such obligations were secured by means of an
_in rem security) are detrimental. In addition pursuant to Article 228 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, unless the debtor or_

348


-----

another affected party (such as a creditor) can prove otherwise to the Court's satisfaction, a disposal made in favor of
"specially related parties" (as defined in the Spanish Insolvency Law) as well as the creation of a security interest
securing a pre-existing obligation or a new obligation that replaces an existing one, and those payments or other acts
extinguishing obligations that would have become due after the declaration of insolvency and which are secured by
means of an in rem security, are presumed to be detrimental. In the case of acts not covered by the presumptions above,
the burden of proof is on the person bringing the claw back action, who consequently must prove the detriment to the
debtor`s estate. Acts deriving from the debtor's ordinary course of business made at arm's length and certain refinancing
arrangements (acuerdos de refinanciación) meeting the legal requirements set forth in Articles 697 and successive of the
Spanish Insolvency Law, as well as the acts and payments made and the security created in connection therewith, may
not be rescinded in case of subsequent insolvency (concurso consecutivo) as provided in the referred Articles.

Accordingly, a Guarantor's acts of disposal with "specially related parties" (such as the Issuer), as defined in the
Spanish Insolvency Law, including intragroup guarantees or security, are presumed to be detrimental unless proved
otherwise.

If the action for rescission against a transaction of a bilateral nature is successful, reciprocal restitution of the
consideration will be ordered, along with any proceed and interest accrued. When it is no longer possible to return the
item received, the cash equivalent of its value at the time they left the debtor's estate, plus interest must be delivered. The
obligation arising from the action for restoration is considered a credit against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la
_masa) so that the counterparty to the debtor will settle such credit simultaneously with the restoration of the assets and_
rights to the insolvency estate, unless the third party is held to have acted in bad faith, in which case the credit due to the
restoration will be considered as subordinate and the liable party must indemnify the debtor for loss and damages
suffered. When the transaction subject to claw back is of an unilateral nature, the judge will order the restoration of the
assets that are the subject of the transaction and the inclusion of the relevant counterparty claim in the list of creditors,
with the relevant ranking in accordance to its nature unless such creditor is deemed in bad faith, so that its claim will be
classified as subordinated.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, acts and transactions governed by laws other than Spanish law will not be
subject to claw back actions if such act or transaction cannot be rescinded or challenged by any means and under any
grounds whatsoever (i.e., not only in insolvency scenarios) under the relevant non-Spanish applicable laws.

The general principle of "no termination effect" is also established such that all agreements remain in force after
the declaration of insolvency. Any contractual arrangements establishing the termination of such kinds of contracts
and/or entitling the relevant counterparty to terminate it in the event of the declaration of insolvency of the debtor will be
unenforceable. As a general rule, agreements creating reciprocal obligations for both parties may be terminated, under
certain circumstances, in the event of breach (although the Court is entitled to order the continuation of the contract to the
extent all due obligations are paid against the debtor's estate) or, with the Court's approval, when the debtor or the
insolvency administrator considers that the termination is in the interest of the insolvency estate. Some specific rules
apply to certain contracts.

As a general rule, set-off is prohibited unless (i) the requirements for the set-off were satisfied prior to the
declaration of insolvency (even if such set-off is alleged afterwards, or the creditor communicated the existence of the
claim to the insolvency administrator); or (ii) the claims and debts arise from the same legal relation. Where there are
claims subject to laws other than Spanish laws, other rules may apply.

Additionally, the declaration of insolvency suspends the accrual of interest on debts prior to the declaration of
insolvency, except for (i) non-moratorium interests on claims secured by an in rem right and subject to the limit of the
value of the security and (ii) any wage credits in favor of employees which will accrue the legal interest set forth in the
State Budget Law (Ley de Presupuestos del Estado).

The current Spanish Insolvency Law distinguishes between insolvency claims (créditos concursales) and claims
against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la masa).

Claims against the insolvency estate, include, among others, (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll,
(ii) certain costs and expenses of the insolvency proceedings, (iii) claims that arise after the declaration of insolvency due
to the continuation of debtor's business activities, (iv) payments arising from agreements with outstanding reciprocal
obligations surviving after the declaration of insolvency, and amounts due as a result of its termination, (v) claims arising
in favor of a creditor subject to a claw back action (except if the creditor acted in bad faith), (vi) claims arising from
obligations lawfully undertaken by the debtor with the approval of the insolvency administrators or by the insolvency
administrators during the insolvency proceedings, (vii) certain amounts arising from obligations created by law or from
the non-contractual liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of insolvency and until its conclusion, and

(viii) in case of liquidation, the credit rights granted to the debtor under a CVA in accordance with article 332 of the
Spanish Insolvency Law, except for new funds granted by the debtor or by persons specially related to the debtor through
a share capital increase, loans or acts with an analogous purpose (temporary COVID-19 legislation has provided for an
exception of this limitation in case of default of CVA approved or modified until 14 March 2022, as long as the CVA or
the amended one identify the borrower and the maximum amount of the financing to be granted or the guarantee to be
perfected), (ix) 50% of the new funds lent under a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the
requirements set forth Title II (Título II) of the Second Book (Libro Segundo) of the Spanish Insolvency Law which is
not subject to claw back (except for new funds granted by the debtor or by persons specially related to the debtor through
a share capital increase, loans or acts with an analogous purpose).. As a general rule, claims against the insolvency estate
are payable when due according to their own terms (and, therefore, are paid before general debts under insolvency
proceedings), unless the debtor's estate is not sufficient to do so, applying in such a case specific ranking rules.
Enforcement of claims against the insolvency estate can be commenced only when a CVA comes into force. Assets
subject to special privilege cannot be affected by the payment of debts against the insolvency estate.

Creditors are required to report their insolvency claims to the insolvency administrator within one month from
the publication of the Court order declaring the insolvency in the Official Gazette, providing documentation to justify
such claims. Based upon the documentation provided by the creditors and documentation held by the debtor, the
insolvency administrator draws up a list of acknowledged creditors/claims and classifies them according to the categories
established in the Spanish Insolvency Law:

    - Creditors benefiting from special privileges; in particular, with claims secured by a specific asset or
right (essentially, in rem security). The scope of the privilege is established by reference to the value of
the collateral as determined pursuant to the rules of the Spanish Insolvency Law (which, in turn, is
calculated by reference to the fair value of the collateral). Thus, an objective distinction is being made
between the portion of the debt that is really covered by the value of the collateral and the portion that
is not. The portion of the debt not covered by the value of the collateral is given the same treatment as
for unsecured claims and will be classified according to its nature. The value of the in rem security will
be that resulting from deducting from nine-tenths of the fair value of the asset or right over which the
security lies, any outstanding debts enjoying a preferential security over the same asset. The value
cannot be less than zero or greater than the value of the privileged claim or the value of the maximum
mortgage or pledge liability which might have been agreed. Fair value means: (i) for listed securities,
the average weighted price at which they would have been traded on one or more regulated markets in
the last quarter before the date of the declaration of insolvency, according to the certificate issued by
the company governing the market in question; (ii) for real estate assets, that resulting from the
appraisal report issued by an officially approved entity; and (iii) for other assets, that resulting from the
report issued by an independent expert in accordance with the valuation principles and rules generally
recognized for these assets. The reports established for the latter two cases will not be necessary when
the value has been determined by an independent expert within six months before the date of the
declaration of insolvency, or when the assets are cash, current credit accounts, electronic money or
fixed-term deposits. These creditors may under certain circumstances initiate separate enforcement
proceedings, though subject to certain restrictions, including a waiting period that may last up to one
year, as well as to specific additional limitations in case of sale and repayment set forth in the Spanish
Insolvency Law depending on whether the secured asset is sold on an individual basis, or as part of a
business unit on a going concern as provided in Article 209 at. seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law. The
insolvency administrator has the option to halt any enforcement of the securities provided that they pay
the respective claim up to the value of the collateral. Specially privileged creditors are not subject to the
CVA, except if they give their express support by voting in favor of the agreement or they are crammed
down to the extent certain majority approval thresholds are reached, even though the respective
creditors are in opposition. In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment with
proceeds obtained from the assets that secure their claim.

    - Creditors benefiting from a general privilege, including, among others, specific labor claims up to a
certain amount; claims for amounts relating to unpaid withholding taxes and social security
contributions; claims for other amounts to be paid to the tax authorities and the social security
authorities for half (50%) of their amount; claims held by the creditor applying for the corresponding
insolvency proceedings, to the extent such application has been approved, for up to half (50%) of the
amount of such claim; and new funds lent under a refinancing agreement entered into in compliance
with the requirements set forth in Title II (Título II) of the Second Book (Libro Segundo) of the
Spanish Insolvency Law not subject to claw back in the amount not admitted as a claim against the
insolvency estate (except for new funds granted by the debtor or by persons specially related to the

350


-----

debtor through a share capital increase, loans or acts with an analogous purpose). The holders of
general privileges are not affected by a CVA if they do not vote in favor of the agreement or they are
crammed down to the extent certain majority approval thresholds are reached, even though the
respective creditors are in opposition. However, some specific content of the CVA cannot be imposed
to dissenting public or labor claims. In the event of liquidation, claims benefiting from a special
privilege are paid before ordinary claims, in accordance with the ranking established under the Spanish
Insolvency Law. Assets subject to a special privilege may not be used to pay general privilege claims,
unless there is an excess after the payment of the secured claim.

    - Special and general privileged creditors must be also classified among one of the following classes:
labor, public, financial and the remaining creditors. This classification is relevant to determine the
majorities to approve a CVA and extend them to dissenting privileged creditors of the same class, as
well as in case of sales of the collateral as part of a business unit on a going concern

    - Ordinary creditors (non-subordinated and non-privileged claims) rank pari passu and will be paid pro
_rata,._

    - Subordinated creditors (those subordinated to all ordinary creditors by virtue of an agreement or
pursuant to law), include, among others, those with certain claims communicated late (outside the
specific one-month period mentioned above); claims that are contractually subordinated vis- à-vis all
other credits of the debtor; claims relating to surcharge and unpaid interest claims (including default
interest) except for those claims secured with an in rem right up to the secured amount; fines; claims
held by creditors that are "specially related parties" to the insolvent debtor; claims resulting from acts
that were claw backed where the creditor was declared in the judgment to have acted in bad faith; and
certain claims deriving from contracts with reciprocal obligations if the creditor attempts to prevent the
fulfillment of the contract to the detriment of the insolvency interests. Subordinated creditors are
second- level creditors; they do not have the right to vote at the creditors' meeting (whereby the CVA is
approved or rejected) but are bound by the CVA, if approved, and are paid last, according to the
ranking established by Spanish Insolvency Law. Moreover, securities granted to secure a subordinate
claim shall be canceled.

In the case of individuals debtors, the following shall be deemed to be "specially related parties": (i) debtor's
relatives, (ii) legal entities controlled by the debtor or its relatives, (iii) legal entities belonging to the company group of
the legal entities referred to in subsection (ii); and (iv) legal entities of which persons referred to in subsections (i),
(ii) and (iii) are directors or de facto directors.

In the case of a legal entity debtors, the following shall be deemed to be "specially related parties":
(i) shareholders with unlimited liability (in case such shareholders are natural persons it would include any special related
party to these shareholders, as described herein); (ii) limited liability shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, 10% or
more of the insolvent company's share capital (or 5% if the company is listed, as is the case of the Issuer) by the time the
credit right arises; (iii) directors (including shadow directors), liquidators and those holding general powers of attorney
from the insolvent company, as well as such individuals holding such positions within two years prior to the declaration
of insolvency; and (iv) companies pertaining to the same group as the debtor and common shareholders to the legal entity
in insolvency and any other company of the group provided such common shareholders meet the minimum shareholding
requirements set forth in (ii) above. Notwithstanding the above, creditors who have directly or indirectly capitalized their
credit rights pursuant to a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Title II
(Título II) of the Second Book (Libro Segundo) of the Spanish Insolvency Law or a CVA (even if those creditors have
assumed a position on the board of directors of the debtor on account of the capitalization) shall not be considered as
being in a special relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor, as a result of the financing granted
under such arrangements. Additionally, those creditors executing a collective refinancing agreement, or a CVA, will not
be deemed as shadow directors as a result of the covenants assumed by the debtor in relation to the viability plan, unless
the existence of a circumstance justifying the shadow directorship is proven. In addition, there is a rebuttable
presumption, established in the Spanish Insolvency Law, that the assignees of the above are also "specially related
persons" if the assignment has occurred within two years prior to the declaration of insolvency. Lastly, claims different
from loans and acts with an analogous purpose held by shareholders and common shareholders will not be subordinated.

Spanish temporary COVID-19 regulations set forth that as regards insolvency proceedings declared until March
14, 2022, new money provided since the declaration of the state of emergency in Spain (i.e. 14 March 2020) by specially
related persons and any claims in which such specially related person is subrogated after such date due to a payment of

351


-----

debts on behalf of the debtor will have the consideration of ordinary claims, thus not subordinated, regardless the
privileges which could exist.

As a general rule, insolvency proceedings are not compatible with other enforcement proceedings (excluding
enforcement proceedings with regard to financial collateral (as defined in Royal Decree Law 5/2005, of 11 March 2005,
as amended from time to time), or collateral located in an EU Member State other than Spain, or labor and administrative
enforcement proceedings in certain circumstances). When compatible, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and
creditors, as a general rule, the Spanish Insolvency Law extends the jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency
proceedings, which is then legally authorized to handle enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the
debtor's assets. Moreover, the effects of insolvency proceedings on a creditor's in rem rights attached to property or rights
–of any kind– of the debt or which, at the time of the declaration of the insolvency proceedings, are located in a state
(other than a EU Member State bound by the EU Insolvency Regulation) must be exclusively governed by the law of that
state.

_Refinancing agreements_

The Spanish Insolvency Law excludes certain types of refinancing agreements from the scope of claw back
actions, including the guarantees and security interest granted in execution of such agreements. There are two types of
refinancing agreements that are ring-fenced against claw-back actions:

    - Collective refinancing agreements are agreements entered into by the debtor who is in a state of actual
or imminent insolvency and has not been declared in insolvency by a court providing for significant
increase of the credit available to the debtor or the modification of the obligations of the debtor under
the original financing agreement either by means of a payment deferral or by setting out new
obligations in substitution of prior ones provided that, in addition, the following conditions are met:
(a) the agreement is subscribed to by creditors holding claims amounting to at least [3]/5 of the debtor's
debt on the date of execution of the refinancing agreement (in case of a group of companies, such
majority must be reached both on a consolidated and individual basis, excluding intragroup claims);
(b) the [3]/5 amount referred to in (a) is confirmed in a certificate issued by the auditor of the debtor (in
case it does not have one, the Commercial Registry will appoint it); and (c) the agreement must be
formalized in a public document. Refinancing agreements must be executed in the context of a viability
plan designed to allow debtors to carry on their business activities in the short and medium term In case
of the pre-insolvency notice has been filed, the execution of the refinancing agreement must take place
in a three months period; and

    - Non-collective refinancing agreements that are those agreements entered into by a debtor who is in a
state of actual or imminent insolvency complying with the requirements set forth in Article 604 of the
Spanish Insolvency Act, namely: (a) the agreement responds to a viability plan seeking the continuity
of the business activity in the short and mid-term; (b) as a result of the refinancing, the initial
proportion of assets in relation to liabilities is increased; (c) the resulting current assets are equal to or
greater than current liabilities; (d) the security and personal guarantees proportion in favor of
participating creditors does neither exceed the previous one, nor exceeds 90% of the value of the total
liabilities affected by the refinancing (the value of the collateral shall be calculated in accordance with
the mechanisms set forth in the Spanish Insolvency Law); (e) the interest rate in favor of the
intervening creditors does not exceed in more than [1]/3 the average rate applicable to the debt before the
refinancing; and (f) the agreement is formalized in a public document, with the intervention of all the
affected parties, and includes a description of the reasons justifying its content from an economic point
of view.

Neither refinancing agreements, homologated as described below but also not homologated when complying
with the legal requirements, nor those acts, transactions and payments executed in compliance with the refinancing
agreement, irrespective of its nature and legal form, nor any security or guarantee perfected in accordance to those, may
be subject to clawback or rescission actions in the event of subsequent insolvency (concurso consecutivo) declared
pursuant to Article 695 et. seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Act. On the contrary, in the event the refinancing agreement is
declared null in case of subsequent insolvency, acts detrimental to the debtor's estate executed by the debtor in the
preceding two (2) years before the declaration of insolvency, as well as those carried out when complying with the
refinancing agreement, may be subject to claw back or rescission. Additionally, in case of subsequent insolvency, any act
carried out by the debtor before the declaration of insolvency, as well as those carried out when complying with the
refinancing agreement, are subject to any other challenging action different from the claw back one as so generally
allowed by Law, which should be brought by the insolvency administrator exclusively.

352


-----

Refinancing agreements satisfying requirements referred to in (i) above (except for the majority referred to in
(a)) may be also homologated (homologado) by the insolvency court if (i) they have been subscribed by creditors
holding, at least, 51% of the debtor's financial liabilities whether or not subject to financial supervision (that is to say the
Spanish Insolvency Law excludes public creditors, labor creditors and those of commercial transactions) at the date of
the refinancing agreement; (ii) the debtor's auditor issues a certificate acknowledging that the 51% majority referred to
above has been reached; and (iii) the agreement is formalized in a public instrument Additionally, adhesions to the
refinancing agreement by creditors not holding financial claims are not included in the calculation, as well as claims held
by creditors who are "specially related to the debtor", although these claims are affected by the sanction of the
refinancing agreement. Claims not represented in euro will be converted in accordance to the official exchange rate as of
the date of the public instrument formalizing the refinancing agreement.

If part of the l liabilities include syndicated loans, all creditors holding an interest in the syndicated loan will be
deemed to have adhered to the refinancing agreement if it is favorably voted upon by at least 75% of the liabilities
represented by the loan, or a lower majority if so established in the syndicated loan agreement. The scope of this measure
is not clear among Spanish scholars or courts and therefore it is not possible yet to ascertain what its practical effects will
be. In addition, a court resolution (rendered by a first instance court) considers that dissenting creditors that should be
considered "special privileged creditors" but who are not able to enforce their security on their own (because, for
instance, their right to enforce is subject to the agreement of a majority of lenders which take part of a syndicated loan)
cannot be considered "secured creditors" with regards to restructuring arrangement and its effects.

Specially preferred creditors who are bound by the homologated refinancing arrangement (because they
supported it or because its effects were extended to it) may start or resume separate enforcement of their collateral upon
court declaration of a breach of the arrangement (which will imply termination of the refinancing agreement and the
cease of its effects on the financial claims), in which case they will keep the amount obtained by enforcement to the
extent of the original debt, and any excess will be added to the insolvency estate. Enforcement cannot be brought in case
the homologated refinancing agreement provides, in case of default, for the extinction of either the pre-existing security
interests or the ones perfected under the refinancing agreement. Default claims filed between January 30 and September
30, 2021 will not be admitted until October 30, 2021, so that the debtor may communicate within such month it intends
to negotiate an amendment or replacement of the refinancing agreement, so that it may have three additional months until
the default claim is admitted for process.

The following cramdown effects of homologated refinancing agreements may be imposed on (i) dissenting or
non-participating unsecured creditors holding financial claims; or (ii) secured creditors to the extent of that part of their
secured financial claim not covered by their security interest, as valued in accordance with the rules set out by the
Spanish Insolvency Law:

(a) If the homologated refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 60% of the debtor's
financial liabilities, maturity of the creditor's claims may be extended for up to five years or the debt converted
into so-called profit participating loans (préstamos participativos) with a five-year maturity.

Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured financial claims covered by the security interest
of non-participating or dissenting creditors, when the agreement has been entered into by creditors holding
secured claims covered by the security interest which represent 65% of the covered amount of the value of the
secured claims covered by the security interest held by all the creditors holding financial liabilities.

(b) If the homologated refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 75% of the debtor's
aggregate financial liabilities:

(i) maturity extensions for up to 10 years;

(ii) haircuts (note that a cap has not been established);

(iii) capitalization of debt (nevertheless, those creditors that have not supported such refinancing agreement
-either because they did not sign the agreement or because they oppose it- may choose between (a) the
debt for equity swap contemplated by the agreement; or (b) a haircut of their claims equal to the
nominal amount (including any share premium) of the shares/quota shares that would have
corresponded to that creditor as a consequence of the relevant debt for equity swap);

(iv) conversion of debt into profit participation loans of up to 10 years, convertible obligations,
subordinated loans, payment in kind facilities, or in any other financial instrument with a ranking,
maturity and features different to the original debt; and

(v) assignment of assets or rights in or for total or partial payment of the debt.

Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured financial claims covered by the security interest
of non-participating or dissenting creditors, when the agreement has been entered into by creditors holding secured
financial claims covered by the security interest which represent at least 80% of the value of the secured financial claims
covered by the security interests held by all the creditors holding financial liabilities.

_CVA regime_

A similar regime than that of the homologated refinancing agreements explained above applies to the CVA. The
proposals in the CVA shall include a payment schedule as well as a viability plan, and shall be filed and voted in the
moment and manner determined by the Spanish Insolvency Law.

The majorities applicable to the CVA depend on the kind of measures included in the CVA proposal to be voted
on:

(i) a simple majority is required for (i) the full payment of ordinary claims with an extension not exceeding three
years, or (ii) the prompt payment of ordinary claims but with haircuts not exceeding 20%;

(ii) the favorable vote of creditors representing at least 50% of ordinary claims is required for: (i) haircuts not
exceeding 50%; (ii) extensions, of principal, interest or any other amount due, for a period not exceeding five
years; or (iii) the conversion of claims into profit participating loans (préstamos participativos), excluding
"public" and "labor" creditors, for a period not exceeding five years; and

(iii) the favorable vote of creditors representing at least 65% of ordinary claims is required for a CVA providing for
any other content among those allowed by the Spanish Insolvency Law (for instance, (a) haircuts exceeding
50%; (b) extensions, either of principal, interest or any other amount due, for a period between five and ten
years; (c) the conversion of claims into profit participating loans (préstamos participativos), excluding "public"
and "labor" creditors, for a period between five and ten years; (d) debt-for-assets deals in relation to some assets
and under certain circumstances, or (e) proposals for allocation of the debtor's business on a going concern to a
specific person with a commitment from the acquirer to continue the activity for the minimum period of time
provided in the CVA and to pay off, totally or partially, the debt as established in the CVA).

For the purposes of the majorities, ordinary claims also include those special and general privileged claims
voting in favor to the CVA. The holders of subordinated credits, as well as creditors considered as specially related to the
debtor who purchased claims after the declaration of insolvency, are not entitled to vote. If part of the liabilities includes
syndicated loans, all creditors holding an interest in the syndicated loan will be deemed to have adhered to the CVA
proposal if at least 75% of the liabilities represented by the loan, or a lower majority if so established in the syndicated
loan agreement, vote in favor.

The effects of the duly approved CVA may be extended to privileged creditors (regardless of the kind of
privilege) and even in relation to the amount of the claim not exceeding the secured claim value. Notwithstanding this, in
order to implement the cramdown mechanism, a dual majority is required: (i) the CVA must be approved by the superior
majority indicated below; and (ii) the CVA must also be approved by creditors of the relevant privileged class, according
to the definition provided under the Spanish Insolvency Law.

The superior majorities required to extend the effects of the CVA to those privileged creditors who have not
voted in favor of the proposal are the following:

(i) the favorable vote of creditors representing at least 60% of any privileged class will be required if the measures
in the proposal include any of those indicated in section (ii) above; and

(ii) the favorable vote of creditors representing at least 75% of any privileged class will be required if the measures
in the proposal include any of those indicated in section (iii) above.

354


-----

Default of the CVA leads to liquidation of the debtor. Exceptionally, COVID-19 regulation has included some
temporary exceptions to the creditors' right and debtor's duty to file for liquidation, as well as the possibility for the
debtor to pursue an amendment to a CVA previously approved, subject to certain limitations and requirements.

_Applicable jurisdiction_

The applicable jurisdiction to conduct an insolvency proceeding is the one in which the insolvent party has its
"center of main interests". This "center of main interests" is deemed to be where the insolvent party conducts the
administration of its interests on a regular basis and which may be recognized as such by third parties. Insolvency
proceedings conducted by the court of the "center of main interests" are considered "the principal insolvency
proceedings" and have universal reach affecting all the assets of the insolvent party worldwide. If the "center of main
interests" is not in Spain, but the insolvent party has a permanent establishment in Spain, Spanish courts will only have
jurisdiction over the assets located in Spain (the "territorial insolvency proceedings").

Other jurisdictions outside the European Union may not require a center of main interests shift in order for a
Spanish company to make a filing in those jurisdictions. Nevertheless, recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings not
based on the center of main interests or pursuant to a reasonable connection of an equivalent nature in Spain by means of
an exequatur process should not be possible and, furthermore, any creditor could file for a non-main insolvency
proceedings in Spain.

In the event Spanish courts have jurisdiction to handle the Issuer's insolvency proceeding (upon a judicial
consideration that the Issuer's "center of main interests" is in Spain), Article 263.2 of the current Spanish Insolvency Law
would apply. Article 263.2 provides that creditors holding a third-party guarantee will be recognized in the insolvency
proceedings in their full amount without any limitation and without prejudice to the fact that if the guarantor is
subrogated in the creditor's place, when the guarantee is enforced, the claim of the guarantor will be classified in
accordance with the ranking corresponding to the creditor or the guarantor, whatever is better for the insolvency estate
interest.

In the event that any of the Guarantors becomes insolvent and it is determine that Spanish courts have
jurisdiction to handle their insolvency proceedings and that the current Spanish Insolvency Law applies, the claim
deriving from the Notes Guarantee will be treated as ordinary debt unless it is subordinated by application of any of the
criteria indicated above..

In addition, under certain circumstances, directors (including shadow directors), liquidators and those holding
general powers of attorney may be held liable for the payment of the claims that cannot be paid with the debtor's assets
upon its liquidation; provided that a court determines that the insolvency was generated or aggravated due to their willful
misconduct or gross negligence (concurso culpable). For such purposes, certain rebuttable and non-rebuttable
presumptions are established by the Spanish Insolvency Law.

Under the current Spanish Insolvency Law, the intercompany loans between the Spanish Guarantors and the
Issuer would be treated as subordinated debt unless COVID-19 benefit applies in relation to new money provided since
the declaration of the state of emergency in Spain in the event the insolvency proceeding is declared by March 14, 2022
at the latest.

_Moratorium_

The current Spanish Insolvency Law imposes a moratorium on the enforcement of secured creditor's rights (in
_rem security) in the event of insolvency, to the extent the collateral can be deemed by the Insolvency Court to be an asset_
necessary for the continuity of the business. The moratorium would take effect following the declaration of insolvency
until the earlier of (i) one year has elapsed since the declaration of the insolvency without liquidation proceedings being
initiated, or (ii) the approval of a CVA that does not affect the exercise of the rights granted by the security interest.
Enforcement will be stayed even if at the time of declaration of insolvency the notices announcing the public auction
have been published. The moratorium may be lifted if the court determines that the asset is not necessary for the debtor's
professional activities of the debtor's business. When it comes to determining which assets of the debtor are used for its
professional or business activities, courts have generally embraced a broad interpretation and will likely include most of
the debtor's assets. Even when the moratorium elapses, in case the creditors did not commence the enforcement before
the insolvency declaration or after the one (i) year moratorium period ends, it could lose its right to enforce separately
within the insolvency proceeding if liquidation is declared, and thus its right to control the sale of the asset by the
insolvency administrator. During the moratorium, the insolvency administrator is also entitled to repay the claim as a
claim against the insolvency estate, up to the value of the collateral as determined under the Spanish Insolvency Law
rules, as to avoid the enforcement.

355


-----

In addition, there are certain rules applying to the assets securing claims in case they are sold in liquidation as
part of the debtor business. Depending on the manner the asset is sold (i.e. with or without the security), such rules could
imply a sale without the creditor's consent is required, in special and among others if the asset is sold individually at an
upfront price which is higher than the minimum price agreed when the security was perfected, or, when sold as part of a
business unit on a going concern, if the secured creditor loses its right to enforce separately within the insolvency
proceeding, or 75% of the special privileged creditors belonging to the same class with right to enforce consent the asset
is sold at a price implying the amount to the paid to such special privileged creditors, as determined by the Spanish
Insolvency Law, is lower than the value of the collateral..

Insolvency proceedings may, normally (although the Spanish Insolvency Law foresees other (unusual)
conclusions in Article 465), lead either to the restructuring of the business financing in place through the implementation
of a CVA or to the liquidation of the debtor's assets.

**_Swiss insolvency law_**

In the event of insolvency of any one of the Swiss Guarantors, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in
Switzerland, and Swiss insolvency law would govern the proceedings. The insolvency laws of Switzerland and, in
particular, the provisions of the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Collection and Insolvency (Bundesgesetz über
_Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs) may be less favorable to the interests of creditors than the insolvency laws of other_
jurisdictions, including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the
insolvency proceedings, and therefore may limit the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover payments due on the
Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

Under Swiss insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which means there is no consolidation of the
assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity
is, from an insolvency law point of view, dealt with separately. As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of
claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-à-vis each entity are dealt with separately.

Under Swiss insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex
_officio, but rather require that the debtor or a creditor file a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on_
an application for commencement of enforcement proceedings and the threat of insolvency, as discussed in the
paragraphs below. Moreover, insolvency proceedings must be initiated by the debtor itself according to Swiss corporate
law in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or can be initiated by a creditor according to Swiss insolvency
law in the event that the debtor has obviously and permanently stopped paying its debts as and when they fall due, has
acted fraudulently or is attempting to act fraudulently to the detriment of its creditors. Furthermore, a debtor may also
initiate insolvency proceedings if it declares itself insolvent (zahlungsunfähig) before court. Generally, pursuant to Swiss
corporate law, a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets, which must be assessed
pursuant to the accounting standards of the Swiss Code of Obligations and on the basis of a balance sheet to be drawn up
(i) on the basis of the liquidation value of the debtor's assets and (ii) to the extent there is still a going-concern scenario,
based upon the going-concern value. If the interim balance sheet shows that the creditors' claims are neither covered by
assets valued at liquidation values nor at going-concern values, the debtor's board of directors must notify the court;
provided that creditors of the debtor do not agree to subordinate their claims in the amount necessary to cover the
over-indebtedness (Art. 725 Swiss Code of Obligations). However, as soon as the debtor loses the going-concern
assumption for accounting purposes, going-concern values become irrelevant and over-indebtedness is assessed solely
based on liquidation values. While the criterion of over-indebtedness is based on a balance sheet test, it is important to
note that a debtor's inability to pay its debts as and when they fall due may cause the debtor to lose the going-concern
assumption for accounting purposes and lead to an obligation to account for liquidation values. This, in turn, will mostly
result in over-indebtedness. The debtor's board of directors is obliged to file for insolvency without delay and
non-compliance with this obligation exposes the board of directors to both damage claims as well as sanctions under
criminal law.in extreme cases. The debtor’s board of directors need not file for bankruptcy if (i) creditors with claims in
an aggregate amount no lower than the amount of the debtor’s over-indebtedness subordinate their claims against the
claims of all other creditors, or (ii) if there is a substantiated likelihood for an informal (i.e. outof-court) workout within a
relatively short period of time. It is not settled in Swiss case law as to how long such period of time is supposed to be.

A revision of the Swiss Code of Obligation regarding the stock corporation will presumably enter into force on
January 1, 2023. Part of the revision covers new solvency requirements to be complied with by the board of directors.
According to the revised Art. 725 Swiss Code of Obligations, the board of directors has to monitor the solvency of the
stock corporation. If the corporation threatens to become insolvent, the board of directors shall take measures to ensure
solvency. The act does not define when the company faces a threatened insolvency. If necessary, the board of directors
shall take further actions to restructure the company or shall propose such actions to the general meeting of shareholders
to the extent that they fall within the latter's competence. If necessary, the board of directors shall submit an application

356


-----

for a stay (Nachlassstundung). The board of directors shall act with due haste. By reference, these duties are also
applicable to the managing directors of a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung).

If a creditor wants to initiate insolvency proceedings, it has to file an application for commencement of
enforcement proceedings (Betreibungsbegehren) with the competent debt collection office (Betreibungsamt). With
respect to unsecured claims, the competent debt collection office is located where the debtor is registered or resident. The
debt collection office will then serve the debtor with the writ of payment (Zahlungsbefehl). There is no material
assessment of the claim at this stage. The debtor may within 10 days upon having been served with the writ of payment,
file an objection (Rechtsvorschlag) to bring the procedure to a halt and obtain an individual stay of proceedings. No
reasons need to be given for the objection. The collection office notifies the creditor of the objection.

For claims based on an enforceable judgment or an enforceable public deed or an order of a Swiss
administrative authority, the creditor can, without any further delay, file an application to lift the stay with the court
(Rechtsöffnungsbegehren). For other claims which are based on a certified or signed document evidencing the claim, the
creditor can apply for provisional lifting of the stay in summary proceedings (provisorische Rechtsöffnung). In the event
the objection is set aside in the summary proceedings, the debtor may within 20 days bring an action in ordinary court
proceedings for negative declaration that the creditor's claim does not exist (Aberkennungsklage).

The creditor may then ask the debt collection office to issue a writ of continuation (Fortsetzungsbegehren) in
relation to an existing writ of payment having full force and effect. The competent insolvency office delivers this writ of
continuation to the debtor. The insolvency court may take preliminary measures to secure property of the debtor in case
this is requested by a creditor and required to secure the creditor's rights. Within 20 days from receipt of the threat of
insolvency (Konkursandrohung), the creditor may petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. The competent
insolvency court decides upon the insolvency without any delay; provided that there are no reasons which would lead to a
suspension of the insolvency court's decision. In addition, the debtor has the right to file a request for a moratorium. The
parties may file an appeal against any decision taken by the insolvency court.

The insolvency court orders the continuation of insolvency proceedings if certain requirements are met; in
particular, if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor
are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only order to continue insolvency proceedings if third parties,
such as creditors, advance the costs of the insolvency proceedings themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the
insolvency proceedings will be closed for insufficiency of assets (Einstellung des Konkursverfahrens mangels Aktiven).
Alternatively, the insolvency office may request the insolvency court to resolve upon summary insolvency proceedings
(summarisches Konkursverfahren) if the assets are not sufficient to cover the cost of ordinary insolvency proceedings and
the actual facts of the case are not complicated. Also, in such case, creditors have the right to request ordinary insolvency
proceedings.

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung), the right to administer the business
and dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency office (Konkursamt). The insolvency office has full
administrative and disposal authority over the debtor's estate (Konkursmasse); provided that certain acts require the
approval of the insolvency court. The creditors' meeting may appoint a private insolvency administrator (private
_Konkursverwaltung) and, in addition, a creditors' committee (Gläubigerausschuss). In such case, the private insolvency_
administrator will be competent to maintain and liquidate the debtor's estate. The creditors' committee has additional
competencies.

Insolvency results in the acceleration of all claims against a debtor, secured or unsecured, except for those
secured by a mortgage on the debtor's real property, and the relevant claims become due upon insolvency. As a result of
such acceleration, a creditor's bankruptcy claim consists of the principal amount of the debt (discounted at 5% if not
interest bearing), interest accrued thereon until the date of insolvency and limited costs of enforcement. Upon insolvency,
interest ceases to accrue. Only secured claims enjoy a preferential treatment insofar as interest that would have accrued
until the collateral is realized will be honored if and to such extent as the proceeds of the collateral suffice to cover such
interests.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured, unless they have a segregation right (Aussonderungsrecht), wishing
to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. Swiss insolvency proceedings are
collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims separately, but can instead
only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of Swiss insolvency laws. Therefore, secured creditors are
generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings,
however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Vorzugsrechte). Generally, entitlement to realize such
security is vested with the insolvency administrator.

357


-----

Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss insolvency laws which provide for a public auction, or, subject
to certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement are used to cover (i) enforcement costs, (ii) the claims of
the secured creditors and (iii) the claims of unsecured creditors, to the extent there are any excess proceeds.

Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal
insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the debtor's estate. Thereafter, all other insolvency claims
(Konkursforderungen) of unsecured creditors will be satisfied pursuant to the distribution provisions of Swiss insolvency
laws, which provide for certain privileged classes of creditors, such as a debtor's employees. Certain privileges can
further result for the government and its subdivisions based on specific provisions of federal law. All other creditors will
be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there are funds remaining in the debtor's estate after the security
interests and privileged claims have been settled and paid in full.

Swiss insolvency law also provides for reorganization procedures by composition with the debtor's creditors
(Nachlassverfahren). Reorganization is initiated by a creditor's or the debtor's request to the competent court for a
provisional stay (provisorische Nachlassstundung) or upon referral by the bankruptcy court. The provisional stay is
followed by the ordinary stay (ordentliche Nachlassstundung), that shall last no longer than 24 months. During the stay,
the debtor is under the supervision of an administrator (Sachwalter) and, for certain cases, of a creditors' committee and
the court. The stay may be set aside in case of a successful reorganization of the debtor, if bankruptcy has to be opened,
or if one of the several statutory types of composition agreement (Nachlassvertrag) has been negotiated with the creditors
and confirmed by the competent court. A composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit
_Vermögensabtretung) has similar effects as a bankruptcy._

**_Uruguayan insolvency law_**

Law 18.387, on Judicial Declaration of Insolvency and Company Reorganization (the "Insolvency Law"),
regulates the judicial declaration of insolvency against any debtor that cannot comply with his obligations.

_Relative and Absolute Presumptions of Insolvency_

The Insolvency Law defines certain scenarios in which a rebuttable presumptions of insolvency arises, including
when (a) the debtor's liabilities exceed its assets; (b) there are two or more embargoes for executive actions or claims
against the debtor for a total amount that exceeds half the value of its enforceable assets; (c) there are one or more
obligations of the debtor that are three months past due; (d) the debtor omits the payment of its tax liability for more than
a year; (e) the permanent closure of the debtor's headquarters; and (f) the Central Bank of Uruguay suspends or closes
one or more of the debtor's bank accounts.

The Insolvency Law also establishes four cases in which an absolute presumption of insolvency arises,
including when (a) the debtor requests its own insolvency declaration; (b) the debtor is declared insolvent by a competent
judge of the country where the debtor is domiciled; (c) the debtor commits fraudulent acts to obtain credits or to remove
assets from the reach of creditors; and (d) the debtor or its management hides or is permanently absent, without leaving a
representative with authority and enough means to comply with the debtor's obligations.

The judicial declaration of insolvency may be requested by (a) the debtor in a voluntary insolvency or (b) any
creditor, with or without an expired loan; (c) any of the administrators or liquidators of the debtor, or the members of the
debtor's internal control body; (d) the partners personally responsible for the debts of the debtor; (e) joint debtors,
bondholders or guarantors of the debtor; or (f) the stock exchanges or union members institutions in a compulsory
insolvency. The debtor has the obligation to file for its own insolvency within thirty days of the date it knew or should
have known it was insolvent.

Before a judicial declaration of insolvency, protective measures can be requested, such as an embargo of assets
and rights of the debtor or an intervention in the debtor's business, to protect the debtor's assets. A declaration of
insolvency results in the suspension or limitation of the debtor's legal standing, the appointment of a trustee and a
controller, the calling of a meeting of creditors (audience) and the registration of the declaration of insolvency in the
National Registry of Personal Acts and its publication in the Official Gazette. The claims of all creditors of the debtor
will become a part of the insolvency proceedings. The debtor or any person with a legitimate interest may appeal the
insolvency declaration.

When a court determines the insolvency of the debtor, it is entitled to intervene in the communications of the
debtor related to its professional activity. The judicial declaration of insolvency does not necessarily mean the debtor
must cease its commercial activity, unless the judge orders it.

358


-----

In a compulsory insolvency of a legal entity, the court may put an embargo on the assets of the entity's
administrators, liquidators or members of the control body if the entity's assets are not enough to cover its liabilities. The
court may also attach assets from former administrators, liquidators or members of the control body if such
administrators, liquidators or control body members were aware of the entity's state of insolvency within the two years
prior to the declaration of insolvency. Additionally, the debtor's legal standing is suspended and a trustee is appointed to
administer the debtor's business and dispose of the debtor's assets.

In a voluntary insolvency, the debtor may maintain its legal standing, jointly managing its assets with an
interventor, as long as the debtor's assets cover its liabilities and the judge finds it appropriate. Otherwise, the debtor's
legal standing will be suspended, and a trustee will be appointed to administer the debtor's business and dispose of the
debtor's assets.

The suspension of the debtor's legal standing has the following effects: (a) all the debtor's acts of administration
and disposition of assets or rights that form the bankruptcy estate shall be invalid; (b) the only person authorized to take
administration and disposition actions shall be the trustee; (c) the trustee shall substitute the debtor in every jurisdictional
or administrative proceeding in which the debtor is party and (d) payments made to the debtor after the suspension of its
legal standing shall not release creditors, except for payments made in good faith after the declaration but before the
registration and publication of the debtor's insolvency. Where the debtor is a legal entity, the trustee shall have all the
powers conferred by law to administrators and liquidators, and the debtor's internal control body shall be suspended from
functioning.

The limitation of the debtor's legal standing determines that the debtor needs special authorization from the
interventor to incur, modify or extinguish obligations; confer, modify or revoke powers; or take any legal act with respect
to its assets out of the ordinary course of business. Any action that the debtor takes without authorization will be invalid.
Its internal control bodies (if exist) shall continue to function in the ordinary course of business, but the convening of any
special meeting of internal control bodies and any partners or shareholders meetings shall require the authorization of the
interventor.

During any stage of the proceedings, certain majorities of unsecured creditors may designate an administrator of
the debtor's business and assets during the insolvency. This administrator shall substitute the trustee or the debtor, as the
case may be. Such majorities may also designate a Commission of Creditors to control the insolvency proceedings.

_Temporary moratorium_

The court that declared the insolvency of the debtor becomes the only competent court to hear the insolvency
proceedings and to order precautionary measures over the debtor's assets. Once the insolvency is declared, all creditors
claims shall be suspended and become a part of the insolvency proceedings. Therefore, the debtor's creditors will not be
able to initiate enforcement against the debtor for any claims that arose prior to the declaration of insolvency outside of
the insolvency proceedings, except claims with respect to labor or family without heritage content. Any court decision or
award that (i) grants to a creditor a credit against the debtor; (ii), has the force of res judicata, national or foreign, that
was decided prior to the declaration of insolvency, shall remain valid.

Creditors benefiting from pledges or mortgages are entitled to pursue enforcement of their claims with the judge
overseeing the insolvency proceedings, beginning 120 days after the declaration of insolvency. Claims expressed in
foreign currency shall be converted to the national currency of Uruguay based on the exchange rate on the date of the
declaration of insolvency, and in accordance with Law 14.500, will continue to be adjusted.

Interest will not accrue on any claims against the debtor, except on claims benefiting from pledges or mortgages
or guarantees and labor claims.

_Effects on contracts_

Upon the declaration of insolvency of the debtor, the trustee or the debtor with authorization of the controller is
entitled to terminate the debtor's contracts unilaterally, in which case the judge will determine compensation for the
damages such termination causes to the other party. However, employment contracts shall not be terminated although the
trustee or controller may request that the judge defer payment on any senior management claims.

The trustee or the debtor with the authorization of the interventor shall administer the debtor's bankruptcy estate
for the satisfaction of the debtor's creditors. Until a resolution is passed either approving an agreement or stipulating the
starting of the liquidation, the disposition or encumbrance of assets with a total value in excess of 5% of the total value of
the bankruptcy estate shall require judicial authorization.

359


-----

In the event the debtor's liabilities exceed its assets, the following acts shall be declared null and void: (i) any
acts executed by the debtor free of charge or without reasonable compensation within the two years prior to the
declaration of insolvency, not including ordinary gifts and other presents and remunerative donations to employees;
(ii) any real guarantee for immature obligations or security over any asset of the debtor for a new obligation executed
immediately after a previous obligation was cancelled, within the six months prior to the declaration of insolvency;
(iii) any payment made by the debtor within the six months prior to declaration of insolvency for immature obligations;
and (iv) the cancellation of any contract within the six months prior to the declaration of insolvency. Any actions or
omissions that the debtor takes to the detriment of its creditors are also revocable if they were executed within the two
years prior to the declaration of insolvency and the debtor acted with fraudulent intent and the counterparty was aware or
should have been aware of the debtor's insolvency. Notwithstanding the foregoing, actions taken in the debtor's ordinary
course of business are not subject to revocation.

Claims against the bankruptcy estate include court fees related to the insolvency process; remuneration for the
trustee or controller; costs related to maintenance, administration, valuation and liquidation of the bankruptcy estate;
claims that arose before the declaration of insolvency; and other legal obligations of the debtor. These claims shall be
paid at their maturity, outside the insolvency proceedings, with assets that are not mortgaged or pledged.

Creditors must file the appropriate documentation within 60 days from the date of declaration of insolvency in
order to verify their claims. In the case of the Notes Guarantees, the verification requested by the Trustee shall benefit all
the holders of the Notes. Creditors who fail to file the appropriate documentation within the time period specified must
then verify their claims judicially and at their expense, losing their right to receive their share of the distributions already
made.

_Categories of Credits_

Credits are classified into special and general preferential credits, common or unsecured credits and
subordinated credits. Special preferential credits are those secured by pledges or mortgages. General preferential credits
are (a) labor credits, with some exceptions; (b) Social Security Bank credits for the contributions of workers; (c) credits
for national and municipal taxes; and (d) 50% of the unsecured credits of the creditor who filed for the declaration of
insolvency, up to 10% of the credits against the bankruptcy estate. Subordinated credits include fines and other penalties
and claims by persons related to the debtor, including family, administrators, liquidators, partners and related companies.
Guarantee credits will be considered as a common credit without special privileges.

_Procedure for verification_

After the deadline for creditors to file for verification of their claims, the trustee or interventor must create a list
of all creditors, their credits, guarantees, legal qualifications and other relevant information. This list will be made
available in court so that any interested party may contest the inclusion or exclusion of certain claims, the amount of
claims and the legal qualifications given.

_Arrangement proposal_

Before the start of the 60-day period prior to the celebration of the creditors meeting, the debtor may propose an
arrangement proposal, with a plan of continuation or liquidation. The proposal can consist of acquittals, settlements, the
transfer of assets to creditors, formation of a company with the unsecured creditors, capitalization of liabilities, creation
of a fund and reorganization of the company, among others. The trustee or controller must issue a special report on the
insolvency of the debtor, the debtor's heritage state and proposal arrangement (if any). In the creditors meeting, this
special report will be discussed, the proposal agreement (if any) analyzed and the creditors committee named.

Before the proposal agreement can be approved, certain majorities of creditors, depending on the content of the
proposal, must accept it. Once the judicial judgment approving the agreement is issued, the suspension or limitation of
the legal standing of the debtor is terminated, unless the agreement states otherwise. Once the agreement is fully
implemented, the debtor can request the conclusion of its insolvency.

If there is a breach of contract, any creditor can file for liquidation of the bankruptcy estate. Furthermore, the
debtor's capacity to dispose and bound the bankruptcy estate shall be suspended, and precautionary measures can be used
to protect the bankruptcy estate.

360


-----

_Liquidation of the bankruptcy estate_

The judge shall order the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate in the following cases: a) when the debtor requests
this in the initial requirement of declaration of insolvency; b) the agreement is not presented by the debtor or not accepted
by the meeting of creditors; c) the agreement does not have judicial approval d) noncompliance of the agreement;
e) whenever the creditors, by reaching certain majority, request it at any time of the proceedings.

The Court's decision ordering the bankruptcy estate's liquidation shall have the following content: a) suspension
of the debtor's ability to dispose and oblige the insolvency mass, naming the controller as a trustee, may it correspond;
b) date for the public bidding in which the bulk sale of the ongoing Business shall take place, as well as a closed
envelope containing the bidding's terms and conditions; c) declaration of dissolution of the corporation's legal entity, and
termination of its administrators duty.

The liquidation of the bankruptcy estate produces the anticipated expiration of all debts previous to the Court's
insolvency declaration, and also it allows and is reasonable cause for anticipated contract resolution.

_Company Sale_

A bulk sale of the company is preferred. However, no offers less than 50% of the appraisal value will be
accepted. If a bulk sale is not achieved, a sale "by parts" will commence. Once all the bankruptcy estate has been
liquidated and the proceeds from the sale have been paid to creditors, the trustee shall request a conclusion or suspension
of insolvency.

_Payment to creditors_

Special preferential credits shall be paid with the proceeds from the sale of the relevant encumbered assets.
Without prejudice to the payment of creditors with special preferential credits, the trustee shall pay with the proceeds
from the sale of goods, in this order, creditors with general preferential claims, unsecured and common creditors and
subordinated creditors.

If, after paying the creditors with special preferential claims, there are not enough assets to satisfy all the general
preferential credits, payment shall be effected in the following order, pro-rata within each category: a) labor credits;
b) credits from the Social Security Bank for the personal contributions of workers; c) credits for national and municipal
taxes; and d) the 50% of unsecured credits of the creditor that requested the declaration of insolvency, up to 10% of the
liability mass. The unsecured credits shall be satisfied pro-rata, jointly with the portion of the special preferential credits
that had not been satisfied with the proceeds from the sale of the encumbered assets. Once the unsecured creditors are
fully paid, payment to the subordinated creditors commences. If there is not enough to pay all the subordinated creditors,
fines are covered first, then dissuasive sanctions and finally the claims held by people related to the debtor.

_Qualification of the Insolvency_

The insolvency is qualified as guilty or fortuitous. The insolvency would be considered guilty when the
insolvency situation arose or was made worse due to fraud or gross negligence of the debtor, its administrators or
liquidators in the case of legal entities. In all other cases, the insolvency would be considered fortuitous.

The law establishes some absolute presumptions of culpability, such as when a) before the declaration of
insolvency, the debtor has unduly assets or rights of the debtor; b) the debtor has no accounting records, multiple
accounting records or false accounting records and c) the debtor had attached false documentation to the filing for
judicial declaration of insolvency.

There are also relative presumptions of culpability, including when a) the debtor has breached its duty to request
a judicial declaration of insolvency; b) the debtor did not cooperate with the insolvency bodies, assist in providing the
necessary information, or assist the creditors meeting.

If the insolvency is qualified as guilty, the judgment of qualification will a) express the cause in which it bases
the guilty qualification; b) determine the people affected by the declaration, as well as any accomplices (i.e., those who
cooperated with the debtor with intentional fault or serious misconduct); c) disqualify the debtor or the administrators,
liquidators and members of the internal control body of the debtor to administer property or third-party assets for a period
of five to 20 years; d) invalidate any right the accomplices had as insolvent creditors, reintegrating their share of the
assets into the bankruptcy estate and making them liable for damages.

361


-----

_Suspension of the insolvency_

The insolvency will be suspended in the case of inexistence or depletion of the bankruptcy estate without full
satisfaction of the creditors. In the court order of suspension of the insolvency, the court can adopt the precautionary
measures that it considers appropriate. The suspended insolvency can be restarted at any moment due to the request of
the debtor or any creditor or if the debtor acquires new assets or rights.

The insolvency concludes if there is full compliance with the agreement, full satisfaction of the creditors or ten
years have passed since the suspension of the insolvency.

_Private agreement for reorganization_

Before the judicial declaration of insolvency, the debtor may enter into a private agreement for reorganization
with creditors that represent 75% of unsecured credits with the right to vote. The agreement can be implemented
privately before a notary public or by the court by requesting judicial homologation. A private agreement shall be binding
for all unsecured and subordinated creditors who are notified of the agreement and do not express their opposition.

If the debtor requests judicial homologation of the private agreement for reorganization and the judge accepts
the agreement, the judge will order the inscription and publication of the writ of admission to notify the insolvency
creditors and give them opportunity to oppose the agreement. This will have the following effects: a) the debtor shall
need judicial authorization to incur, modify or extinguish obligations; grant or modify powers of attorney; or carry out
any judicial act with regard to its heritage; b) the debtor's insolvency cannot be declared, except at his request; c) any
executions and embargoes against the debtor with respect to claims that arose prior to the agreement shall be suspended;
d) mortgages and pledges cannot be enforced for a period of 120 days starting from the date of the writ of admission, and
any enforcement actions underway will be suspended for the same period of time; and e) the judge may adopt
precautionary measures on the assets that compose the debtor's heritage. The unsecured or subordinated creditors, with
the exception of those that had signed the agreement, may oppose the agreement. In case of opposition, the judge will
designate a controller to control the debtor's activity and will give judgement homologating or rejecting the agreement.

Once all parties are in full compliance with the agreement, the debtor will request that the judge declare so and
conclude the insolvency, if applicable. In the case of non-compliance, any creditor can request that the judge declare
insolvency of the debtor.

_International Jurisdiction for the Declaration of Insolvency_

Uruguayan courts shall have the authority to declare insolvency when a) the address or effective center of
activities of the debtor is in Uruguayan national territory; b) the debtor has or had its office, establishment or exploitation
in Uruguayan national territory, even when its address or effective center of activity is situated overseas.

If the debtor had been declared insolvent or similar in another state where it had his address; effective center of
activity; office, establishment or exploitation, the remaining assets or rights from the insolvency process of that State will
be included in the insolvency proceedings in Uruguay.

_Law applicable to the insolvency_

Uruguayan law will govern all aspects of all declared insolvencies in Uruguay, with the exception of the effects
of the declaration of insolvency on the debtor's concluded contracts, which will be governed by the provisions in the
contract.

National and foreign creditors will be treated equally under the law, with the exception of labor claims, which
are given general preferential treatment to charge assets located in Uruguay. If in the country of residence of the debtor,
the Uruguayan creditors are not admitted on equal terms as the nationals of that state, the reciprocity principle arises,
except with respect to pledges or mortgagees.

A foreign judgment of insolvency will be admitted in Uruguay if (a) it has been granted by a competent judge;
(b) it is a final judgment; (c) the debtor has had opportunity to defend itself; (d) it is not contrary to the international
public order; (e) it complies with the general requirements of articles 537 to 543 of the General Procedural Code. If the
Uruguayan judge recognizes the foreign judgment, the Uruguayan judge may adopt any precautionary measures
considered relevant to guaranteeing the heritage of the debtor in Uruguayan territory.

362


-----

If the foreign declaration of insolvency pertains to a debtor with address, effective center of activities, office,
establishment or exploitation in Uruguay, any of the legitimized may request the initiation of the insolvency in Uruguay.

If there are simultaneous insolvency proceedings in Uruguay and in other country, the Uruguayan judge and
trustee or shall procure their actions with the same of the other country. The Insolvency Law shall apply in all respects as
long as it does not contradict any international agreements signed by Uruguay.

**Fraudulent transfer provisions of general applicability including during bankruptcy**

**_Argentina_**

The Argentine Bankruptcy Law contemplates that, debt payments made prior to the scheduled maturity date by
a person of Argentina to be declared bankrupt during the so-called "suspect period" are not valid against third parties and,
therefore, are subject to be returned to the bankruptcy estate. The "suspect period" extends from the time the court
determines that the debtor is in default until the date the judgment is issued the declaration of bankruptcy of the debtor;
this period cannot exceed two years. The cash payment is made canceling filed in outstanding debt insolvency process
could be construed as a prepayment of principal, as in some cases is done prior to the scheduled maturity date of the debt
to be.

The aforementioned suspect period, shall be the period that elapses between the date determined as the default
day and bankruptcy judgment. In that sense, the default date shall be.

Furthermore, some acts performed during such period are ineffective and void, in that sense:

    - Donations;

    - Prepayment of liabilities due under the title should occur on the day of the bankruptcy or after;

    - Constitution of mortgage or pledge or any other preferences, for unexpired obligation that originally
had no such guarantee.

The declaration of ineffectiveness is pronounced without action or request or expressed without processing. The
order is appealable and incidental means of appeal.

_Acts declared ineffective due to knowledge of default_

Other acts detrimental to creditors granted in the "suspect period" may be declared ineffective with regard to
creditors if, at the time of execution, those who carried out those acts with the bankrupted entity were aware of the
debtor's bankrupt situation or if when granting such act there was a collusion between the relevant party and the
bankrupted entity (or its controlling shareholder). The third party must prove that the act did not cause damage to the
bankrupted entity (e.g. it was an arms' length transaction in market terms) and thereby to its unsecured creditors. The
claim to have such act declared ineffective must be filed by the syndic, who is the individual (lawyer or chartered
accountant) appointed by the Court in the bankruptcy proceeding to represent the creditors, within six months and is
subject to prior approval of a simple majority of the verified unsecured creditors declared admissible by the court.

**_Austria_**

In addition to the claw back actions in the event of insolvency discussed under the Austrian Insolvency Law
section above, under Austrian law any creditor having a due receivable against a debtor and having unsuccessfully
enforced such receivable against this debtor may bring in an action to avoid transactions between this debtor and a third
party in the event it has been performed or entered into to the detriment of creditors. Transactions may be avoided in
particular in the following cases pursuant to the provisions of the Austrian Avoidance Act (Anfechtungsordnung—AnfO)
which, however, ceases to apply at the end of June 30, 2021. It shall continue to apply to legal acts before July 1, 2021
and for any legal acts as of July 1, 2021, sec. 438 et seq. of the Austrian Execution Act (Exekutionsordnung - EO) shall
apply, which basically resembles the provisions of the AnfO:

(a) Intentional discrimination of creditors (Sec 2 AnfO / as of July 1, 2021 Sec 439 EO):

    - Creditors are entitled to avoid transactions performed by the debtor with the intent to harm its creditors

(i) ten years prior to bringing in the claim for avoidance; provided that the other party was aware
of the debtor's intent;

363


-----

(ii) two years prior to bringing in the claim for avoidance if the other party must have been aware
of such intent at the time of the transaction; or

(iii) (solely as of July 1, 2021 pursuant to Sec 439 EO) in respect to purchase, exchange and
supply contracts entered into by the debtor in the year preceding the avoidance, and delivery
contracts entered into by the debtor in the year preceding the avoidance, provided the other
party recognised or should have recognised the intentional discrimination.

    - Creditors are also entitled to avoid purchase, swap, and distribution agreements entered into by the
debtor in the last year prior to bringing in the claim for avoidance if the other party realized or must
have realized a dissipation of funds.

(b) Transactions for no consideration (Sec 3 AnfO / as of July 1, 2021 Sec 440 EO):

    - Creditors are entitled to avoid transactions performed by the debtor for no consideration in the previous
two years prior to bringing in the claim for avoidance.

Pursuant to Sec. 8 AnfO / as of July 1, 2021 Sec 443 EO, all creditors of a debtor are entitled to challenge the
validity of the debtor's transactions pursuant to the above provisions of the AnfO / EO without regard to when their own
claims originated; provided that

    - their claims are enforceable against the debtor and

    - the enforcement has not resulted in the creditor's claims being fully satisfied or it can be assumed that
such enforcement will not result in a full satisfaction of the creditor's claims.

The creditor must bring such action against the person for whose benefit the transaction has been performed, or
against the person which actually benefited from the transaction. The creditor may demand that its receivable is satisfied
from the consideration which left the debtor's assets through the ineffective transaction. The beneficiary may discharge
from the creditor's claim through its full payment to the creditor.

**_Belgium_**

Regardless of any declaration by the commercial court of a suspect period (see further under "Limitations on
_validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests and certain insolvency law_
_considerations—Applicable insolvency laws—Belgian insolvency law"), transactions of which it can be demonstrated that_
they have been entered into with the fraudulent intention to cause prejudice to a third creditor, may be declared
ineffective against third parties.

**_Chile_**

The new Law 20.720 on Insolvency abolished the old structure of fortuitous, culpable or fraudulent bankruptcy
and assigned the matter to the criminal courts, under general criminal provisions established in the Criminal Code.

Of those provisions of the Criminal Code related to bankruptcy, the most relevant are the following:

    - Article 463, punishing those that -within 2 years prior to the liquidation resolution- perform acts or
agreements diminishing the value of their assets or increasing their debts without other economic or
legal aim than that of damaging its creditors.

    - Article 463 bis, punishes those that -within 2 years prior to the liquidation resolution-, fully or partially
hide assets; use for their own benefit -or for another third parties- assets that should be included in the
liquidation process; or after the liquidation resolution, transfer or encumber assets.

    - Article 463 ter, punishing those that during the reorganization or liquidation procedures deliver fake or
incomplete information to the Supervisor, the Liquidator or the creditors; or that do not keep
accountancy books in the legal manner; or hide, destroy or alter them.

**_The Czech Republic_**

Apart from challenging legal acts as being ineffective during the insolvency proceedings, which is discussed
under “Clawback risks under Czech insolvency law” section above, under Czech law, pursuant to Czech Act
No. 89/2012, Civil Code ("Czech Civil Code") and under conditions stipulated therein, any creditor having a due
receivable against the debtor may demand that a court declares a certain legal act (or legal acts) of the debtor, which
curtail satisfaction of that creditor's receivable, as being ineffective against that creditor.

The legal acts which may be brought to an action must curtail a creditor's enforceable receivable (i.e. a
receivable adjudicated by a court or subject to another enforceable title) and fall under one of the following types:

(a) legal acts which the debtor made in the last five years with the intention to curtail its creditors, provided that the
debtor's counterparty in that legal act was aware of such intention;

(b) legal acts by which the debtor curtailed its creditors in the last two years, provided that the debtor's counterparty
in that legal act must have been aware of the intention to curtail its creditors; or

(c) legal acts which led to curtailment of a creditor and were made between the debtor and its affiliate (osoba
_blízká) or for the benefit of a debtor's affiliate (osoba blízká) in the last two years, unless the debtor's_
counterparty in that legal act was not aware (or was not supposed to have been aware) of the debtor's intention
to curtail its creditor at the moment of making such legal act;

(d) a contract on sale or contract on exchange concluded in the immediately previous year, provided that the
debtor's counterparty must have recognized that by entering into such contract the debtor's property is being
wasted to the detriment of the creditor's satisfaction;

(e) a legal act made by the debtor without any consideration (i.e. free of any payment) as being ineffective if it has
occurred in the last two years. This does not apply in the case of (i) fulfilment of duties imposed by law;
(ii) provision of common occasional gifts; (iii) donation of a reasonable amount provided for a publicly
beneficial purpose; or (iv) a performance provided to satisfy a moral obligation or considerations of decency.

A creditor may, before its claim becomes enforceable, reserve the right to invoke ineffectiveness of a legal act
by notifying the person against which it may invoke such ineffectiveness and make such reservation through a notary,
private enforcement officer or a court. In such case, the time limit for the creditor to invoke ineffectiveness of a legal act
commences only after the relevant claim becomes enforceable.

The creditor must bring the action against the debtor's counterparty or against the person which actually
benefited from such legal act (or their successors). The creditor may demand that its receivable is satisfied from the
consideration which left the debtor's assets through the ineffective legal act. If such satisfaction is impossible, the creditor
may demand that the beneficiary of the ineffective legal act compensates for the benefit it received from the ineffective
legal act.

If insolvency proceedings are initiated against the debtor before the court decides on ineffectiveness of a
fraudulent legal act, the proceedings on the fraudulent legal act are halted by virtue of law. However, if the competent
ordinary court decides that an act was fraudulent and such decision becomes legally effective before the debtor is
declared insolvent, the creditor may still (notwithstanding the pending insolvency proceedings) demand that the
beneficiary surrenders to the creditor the consideration the beneficiary received from the fraudulent legal act. Such
consideration is not required to be included in the insolvency estate.

**_France_**

Article L.632-1-6° of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) provides that any security interest
granted after the date on which the underlying debt it secures was incurred (dettes antérieurement contractées) and which
is determined to have been granted during the hardening period is null and void. The hardening period is a period of time,
the duration of which is determined by the bankruptcy judge upon the judgment recognizing that a cessation of payments
of the insolvent company has occurred. The hardening period commences on the date of such judgment and extends for
up to 18 months prior to the date of such judgment.

Furthermore, Article L.632-2, 1st paragraph, of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) provides that
the bankruptcy court may declare void (i) any agreement involving consideration (acte à titre onéreux) entered into
during the hardening period and (ii) payment of debt, which would mature during such period, if, in either case, the
bankrupt debtor's contracting party knew that such debtor was insolvent (cessation des paiements).

**_Germany_**

Under the German Insolvency Code, during applicable contest periods, the insolvency administrator or, if debtor
in possession status is granted, the custodian may contest (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are
deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of formal insolvency
proceedings. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully contested by the insolvency
administrator, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be
returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator's right to contest transactions can, depending on the circumstances,
extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency
proceedings. Moreover, apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator contesting transactions according to the
German Insolvency Code described above, under the German Act of Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz), a creditor who has
obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also contest any security right or payment performed
under the relevant security right outside formal insolvency proceedings. For further details concerning the pre-requisites
for a contest of acts and legal transactions, please refer to "—Limitations on validity and enforceability of Notes
_Guarantees granted by any German subsidiaries—Hardening periods and fraudulent transfer"._

In addition, under German law, a creditor who is the beneficiary of a transaction effecting the repayment of the
stated share capital of a debtor in the form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG or obtained security from a debtor may be
liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor's impending insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor's
impending insolvency at the time such funding was provided or extended and/or such security was granted. The German
Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that such liability may arise if, for example, the creditor acted with the
intent to detrimentally influence the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of
bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be presumed if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any
circumstances indicating that the debtor was close to insolvency (Zusammenbruch) or had reason to enquire further with
respect thereto.

**_Italy_**

Upon the commencement of a bankruptcy, the following acts would be without effects (privi di effetto) as
provided for by Articles 64 and 65 of Royal Decree March 16, 1942, n. 267 vis-à-vis the creditors:

    - transactions entered into by the debtor, should they have been entered into in the two years preceding
the declaration of bankruptcy and should they be deemed gratuitous acts (such as those, under certain
circumstances, for the benefit of third parties); and

    - payments, which fall due on the day of the declaration of bankruptcy or thereafter, made in the two
years preceding the declaration of bankruptcy.

In addition, after the bankruptcy declaration, the following acts could be revoked (revocati) pursuant to
Article 67 of the above-mentioned Royal Decree (the result of which is a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the
bankruptcy), unless the defendant in the related action proves that it was unaware of the state of insolvency of the debtor
at the time the transaction was entered into:

    - the onerous transactions entered into in the year preceding the insolvency declaration, where the value
of the debt or of the obligations undertaken by the debtor exceeds by 25 per cent. the value of the
consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor;

    - payments of debts, due and payable, made by the debtor, which were not paid in cash or by other
customary means of payment in the year preceding the insolvency declaration;

    - pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt in the year preceding the insolvency declaration in
order to secure pre-existing debts which have not yet fallen due; and

    - pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt in the six months preceding the insolvency declaration
in order to secure which had fallen due.

Moreover, should the receiver prove that the defendant in the related action was aware of the state of insolvency
of the debtor, the payment of debts past due and payable, non-gratuitous acts, and acts establishing a pre- emption right
for debt including those of third parties, contextually arisen, made within six months preceding the declaration of
bankruptcy, could be revoked. In any case, the receiver - who is the individual deputed to bring the above action(azione

366


-----

_revocatoria fallimentare) - could always resort to the action described in the following paragraph (as provided for by_
Article 66 of the above-mentioned Royal Decree).

The following transactions are exempt from clawback actions:

    - a payment for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice;

    - a remittance on a bank account, provided that it does not reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the
bank in a material and lasting manner;

    - a sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code,
in force as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, made for a fair value and concerning a residential
property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three
degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of
the purchaser, on the condition that, as of the date of the insolvency declaration, such activity is
actually exercised or the investments for the start of such activity have been carried out;

    - transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees granted with respect to the bankrupt entity’s
goods, provided that they concern the implementation of a piano di risanamento attestato;

    - a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee issued to implement a concordato preventivo or
an accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti and transactions entered into, payments made and security
interests granted after the filing of the application for a concordato preventivo;

    - remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants; and

    - payment of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services
necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedure.

The limitation period for initiating clawback action is three years from the declaration of bankruptcy or, if
earlier, five years from the act or transaction to be clawed-back.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances, as well as in the ordinary course of business, an action
can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor (even if the acting creditor owns a credit which is still under condition or
term) within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, an agreement and any other act by which
it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a claw-back (azione revocatoria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian
Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, agreement
and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the
said guarantee, agreement and other act only if it finds that, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice:

    - the debtor was aware of the prejudice that the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor or, if
such act was prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for the
purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; or

    - in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of the said prejudice and, if the
act was prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the
fraudulent scheme.

The Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency provides special regimes on preferences and avoidances of intra-group
transactions. Under Article 290 the limitation period for initiating intra-group clawback actions (referring to acts and
transactions entered into by companies belonging to the same group that jeopardize the creditors’ interest) is extended to
five years from the filing for bankruptcy declaration.

Law no. 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified” clawback
action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract
(registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings
over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/nullifying the relevant (fraudulent)
transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g. gratuitous transfers, or

367


-----

creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so-called fondo patrimoniale - ”family trust”). In case of gratuitous
transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by the creditor against the third-party purchaser

**_Luxembourg_**

Regardless of any declaration by the commercial court of a suspect period (see further under “Limitations on
_validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the security interests and certain insolvency law_
_considerations—Applicable insolvency laws—Luxembourg insolvency law”), transactions of which it can be_
demonstrated that they have been entered into with the fraudulent intention to cause prejudice to a third creditor, may be
declared ineffective against third parties. The general revocatory action open to any creditor who is the victim of an act
defrauding its rights, pursuant to article 1167 of the Luxembourg Civil Code (actio pauliana) and foreign revocatory
actions not founded on insolvency regulations (to the extent applicable under conflict of laws rules), should remain
available to such creditor.

**_Mexico_**

According to the Mexican Federal Civil Code (Código Civil Federal), acts executed by a debtor in prejudice of
its creditor may be declared void upon creditor petition, if those acts result in debtor’s insolvency and the credit base of
the claim is prior to such acts. Similarly, the Mexican Federal Bankruptcy Law considers acts in fraud of creditors those
carried out prior the judicial declaration of insolvency, intentionally defrauding creditors if the third party in the act was
aware of such fraud. Furthermore, the Mexican Bankruptcy Law (Ley de Concursos Mercantiles) provides that execution
took place within the “retroaction date” (270 natural days prior to the judicial declaration of insolvency, that could be
increased up to 3 years), considers as acts in fraud of creditors by a legal entity: (i) acts carried out on gratuitous basis;
(ii) acts and transfers in which a merchant pays a notoriously higher price or receives a notoriously lower payment in
comparison to the consideration of his counterpart; (iii) operations carried out by a merchant in which terms and
conditions agreed are significantly different to the prevailing market conditions, in the date of its execution, or from the
merchant uses and practices; (iv) forgiveness of debt made by a merchant; (v) payments made by a merchant before they
fall due; and (vi) discounts made by a merchant to its own merchandise beyond the “retroaction date”; (vi) granting or
increasing in guarantees, when the original obligation did not required such guarantees, (vii) debt payments made in kind,
when such payments differ from the payment originally agreed or the consideration was established in cash; (viii) may be
deem as fraudulent such transaction that were carried out as of the “retroaction date” by the board members or relevant
officers with: (a) family members; or (b) companies controlled over fifty percent by such board members or officers, or;
(c) that share the same board or officers.

**_The Netherlands_**

Dutch law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent transfer both in and outside of bankruptcy. Under
these provisions, a legal act performed by a person, including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it
guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a
third party's obligations, additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar
effect, can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person and may be nullified by the bankruptcy trustee
in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy if (i) the
person performed such acts without an obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor concerned, or in the case of the
person's bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced as a consequence of the act and (iii) at the time the act was or the acts
were performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that the person's
creditors, existing or future, would be prejudiced. In addition, in the case of a bankruptcy, the trustee in bankruptcy may
nullify the debtor's performance of any due and payable obligation, including, without limitation, an obligation to provide
security for any of its or a third party's obligations, if (i) the payee knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed at
the moment of payment or (ii) the performance of the obligation was the result of a consultation between the debtor and
the payee with a view to give preference to the latter over the debtor's other creditors.

If a Dutch court found that the granting of the Notes Guarantees or the Collateral or any other transaction
entered into by the Dutch Guarantors at any time in connection with the Notes, including the transactions contemplated
by the Intercreditor Agreement, involved a fraudulent transfer as set out, then the granting of the Notes Guarantees or the
Collateral or any other transaction entered into by the Dutch Guarantors could be nullified. In the case of successful
challenge, holders of the Notes would not enjoy the benefit of the Notes Guarantees, the Collateral or other transaction.
The value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes, whether upon enforcement of
the Collateral or otherwise, also could be subject to recovery from such holders of the Notes and possibly from
subsequent transferees, by prejudiced creditors of the Dutch Guarantors as a result of any fraudulent transfer. In addition
holders of the Notes may be held liable for any damages incurred by such prejudiced creditors.

-----

With the introduction of the WHOA procedure, a new exception to the applicability of insolvency claw back
(fraudulent conveyance) has been introduced for certain legal acts (rechtshandelingen) entered into as part of the
implementation of a WHOA restructuring plan. The WHOA-debtor can request the court to determine that certain legal
acts are exempt from fraudulent conveyance claims by a (future) bankruptcy trustee of the debtor in case of the debtor's
(post-WHOA) bankruptcy. This request will be granted if (i) the legal act is necessary to continue the debtor’s business
during the preparation of a restructuring plan, and (ii) it could reasonably be assumed at the time approval was granted
that this legal act would be in the interests of the joint creditors and would not materially prejudice the interests of any
individual creditors. This exception under the WHOA procedure introduces an instrument that intends to encourage
rescue (or DIP) financing for the debtor to assist with putting a restructuring plan into effect (including the granting of
any related security rights). It is not limited to financing in the form of a cash loan but also, for example, the supply of
goods on credit.

**_Poland_**

Under the Polish Civil Code there are specific provisions aimed at protecting the creditor against the detrimental
actions of the debtor (so called Actio Pauliana). It provides the creditor with the right to appeal against the transaction
performed by the debtor which is harmful to creditors. As a result, such a transaction may be considered to be ineffective
towards the appellant.

There are the following prerequisites for using the institution:

    - creditors' detriment if due to the legal transaction performed by the debtor a third party obtained a
financial benefit,

    - action of the debtor with the intent to inflict harm on the creditors, and

    - knowledge of, or opportunity for, a third party exercising due diligence to find out that the debtor is
acting with the intent to inflict harm on the creditors.

The creditor bears the burden of proof with respect to the aforementioned prerequisites.

The Polish Civil Code states that harm to the creditors occurs:

    - due to actual (and not only potential) insolvency of the debtor as the result of a legal transaction it has
performed, or

    - when the level of the debtor's insolvency increases after a legal transaction in comparison to the level
of insolvency prior to the transaction.

The debtor is aware that it is acting to the detriment of the creditor if it realizes that as the result of the
transaction it may prevent satisfaction of the creditors' claims or reduce the scope of the debtor's insolvency. The debtor
does not have to act with intent to inflict harm on the creditors. It is sufficient that the debtor sees the harm as being
conceivable.

In two cases, however, facilitation of proof has been introduced (presumption) with respect to demonstration of
awareness of the third party. One of them is a situation where the debtor remains in close relations with a third party and
another is the case of an entrepreneur who is in close economic relations with the debtor.

The period in which a legal action may be instituted or accusations raised on the basis of Actio Pauliana is
limited to a 5 years reckoned from the date of the transaction.

**_Portugal_**

Notwithstanding the ability of the Insolvency Administrator to challenge the transactions entered into during the
four years prior to the judicial declaration of insolvency, as a general rule under Portuguese law, a claw back action
(impugnação pauliana) pursuant to Article 610 of the Portuguese Civil Code can be brought by any creditor of a given
debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, agreement or any other act by which it
disposes of any of its assets. The claw back action results in a declaration of ineffectiveness with respect to the acting
creditor of the said guarantee, agreement or other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor's right of
credit.

369


-----

A Portuguese court could revoke said guarantee, agreement or other act only if the acting creditor's claim, in
addition to being prejudiced as outlined above, fulfilled the following requirements:

    - arose prior to the challenged act, or, if subsequent, the act was fraudulently designed for the purpose of
prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim; and

    - as a result of the act, would be impossible for the acting creditor to fully satisfy.

In the case of a non-gratuitous act, the debtor and the third party involved must have acted in bad faith, meaning
the parties were aware of the prejudice caused to the rights of the acting creditor. In the case of a gratuitous act, the
ineffectiveness of the act is declared even if such parties acted in good faith.

**_Romania_**

Under Romanian law, security interests and personal guarantees should be scrutinized, on a case by case basis,
from the following legal perspectives:

_Financial assistance_

According to Law no. 31/1990 regarding companies ("Companies' Law"), under the sanction of absolute nullity,
it is forbidden for a company to lend or advance money or set up guarantees for the purpose of the acquisition by a third
party of that company's shares.

_Corporate assets abuse and other restrictions_

Under Companies' Law, it is a criminal offence the use, by the company's founder, administrator, director or
legal representative, in bad faith, of the assets or credit worthiness of that company, for a purpose that is contrary to that
company's interests, or for his/her own interest or for the purpose of favoring another company in which he/she holds a
direct or indirect interest.

The Companies' Law forbids a company to guarantee (directly or indirectly) debts of its directors; the restriction
also applies to companies where the guarantor's director is a director. Additionally, under the Companies' Law it is a
criminal offence for the founder or administrator of a company to borrow, directly or indirectly, amounts from the
company he/she manages, from a company controlled by the company he/she manages, or from a company who controls
the company he/she manages or makes any such company grant security for his/her own debts.

_Nullity of the guarantee for lack of capacity/cause_

Under Romanian law, a contract lacking a valid cause (i.e. a valid reason of the guarantor to establish the
security) is null and void.

_Actio pauliana_

Romanian Civil Code allows the creditors of a person to exercise a legal action called actio pauliana, through
which they request that any deed or act entered into by their debtor which is fraudulent towards them to be declared
inapplicable towards them. As such, by using this type of legal action, a creditor of a guarantor that considers to have
been prejudiced by the security, may request the inapplicability towards it of the respective security document.

_Insolvency_

Romanian Insolvency Law allows the judicial administrator/liquidator (or creditors committee/the creditor
owning over 50% of the total value of the receivables against the insolvent company, in certain cases) to request the
cancellation of fraudulent acts or deeds entered into by the insolvent company detrimental to its creditors two years prior
to the opening of the insolvency procedure.

**_Spain_**

Apart from the claw back action in the event of insolvency discussed above under the section "Spanish
_insolvency law", pursuant to articles 1,290-1,299 of the Spanish Civil Code, any creditor (as well as the insolvency_
administrator (administrador concursal) in the event that the debtor is declared insolvent, according to Articles 232 and
238 of the Spanish Insolvency Law) may bring an action to rescind a contract or agreement (acción rescisoria pauliana)

370


-----

against its debtor and the third party which is a party to such contract or agreement; provided the same is performed or
entered into fraudulently and the creditor cannot obtain payment of the amounts owed under the relevant contract or
agreement in any other way. Although case law is not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted that the following
requirements must be met in order for a creditor to bring such action:

    - the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract or agreement and the fraudulent action
took place after such debt was created;

    - the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third party;

    - that such act was fraudulent: according to scholars and case law, the proof of fraud is objective, based
on facts such as (i) the debtor is aware that his act caused a prejudice to the creditor and that there are
no remaining assets with which to comply with its debts once the action to rescind has been carried out
and (ii) the third party is also aware of the fraud (as construed above) or the third party is involved in
such act;

    - there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages
suffered; and

    - the debtor's insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the
debtor's estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim.

The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements under
article 1,291.3º of the Spanish Civil Code for the action to rescind to succeed. Pursuant to article 1,297 of the Spanish
Civil Code: (i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration, and (ii) transfers for
consideration carried out by parties who have been held liable by a court (sentencia condenatoria) or whose assets have
been subject to a writ of attachment (mandamiento de embargo) will be considered fraudulent. The presumption referred
to in (i) above is a iuris et de iure presumption (cannot be rebutted by evidence), unlike the presumption indicated in
(ii) above, which is a iuris tantum presumption (a rebuttable presumption). Pursuant to Article 1,292 of the Spanish Civil
Code, payments of non-due debts made in insolvency may also be rescinded.

According to scholars, if the action were to be upheld the third party would be liable to return the consideration
received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor. Following that, the creditor would need to
carry out the actions necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor. If the consideration received by the third party
under the contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the third party must indemnify the creditor for such damages.

Pursuant to Article 1,299 of the Spanish Civil Code, the action to rescind the contract elapses after four years,
beginning from the date in which the fraudulent act to be revoked took place (however, according to case law, such term
begins on the date in which the creditor has had knowledge of the action).

Finally, in case of insolvency, the Spanish Insolvency Law establishes that claw back actions regulated in its
Article 226 et. seq. do not override the ability of the insolvency administrator (administrador concursal) or the creditor to
bring any other action to rescind the contract or agreement (acción rescisoria), and that such action may be brought
before the court handling the insolvency proceedings.

**_Switzerland_**

Under Swiss insolvency laws, the insolvency administrator or creditors may, under certain conditions, void
transactions, such as, inter alia, the granting of or the payment under any guarantee or a payment already made under a
guarantee, in which case the recipient of the payment would be required to return the amount received to the debtor's
estate. In particular, a transaction, which includes the granting of a guarantee and the payment of debt, detrimental to the
debtor's other creditors may be voided according to Swiss insolvency laws in the following cases if such acts result in
damages to the other creditors:

    - The debtor has gifted or disposed of assets without any consideration or received consideration of a
significantly lower value than its own performance in a transaction, provided that the debtor executed
such transaction within the year prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings
(Konkurseröffnung) against the debtor or the granting of a provisional stay (provisorische
Nachlassstundung).

371


-----

    - The following acts are voidable if performed by the debtor within the year prior to the opening of
formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) against the debtor or the granting of a provisional
stay (provisorische Nachlassstundung); provided that the debtor was already over-indebted at the time
of the act: (i) granting of security for existing claims; provided that the debtor was not previously
obliged to grant such security; (ii) payment of a monetary obligation (Geldschuld) in any other way
than by payment in cash (Barschaft) or other customary means of payment; and (iii) the payment of a
debt not yet due. However, any voidance action is dismissed if the beneficiary of the transaction can
prove that it was not aware of the debtor's over-indebtedness and, being diligent, could not know that
the debtor had been over-indebted at the time of the act.

    - Furthermore, any acts performed by the debtor within the five years prior to the opening of formal
insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) against the debtor or the granting of a provisional stay
(provisorische Nachlassstundung) with the intent to discriminate against some creditors or to favor
some creditors are voidable if such intention was, or exercising the requisite due diligence, must have
been known to the debtor's counterparty.

If the Notes Guarantee granted by the Swiss Guarantor is voided as summarized above or held unenforceable for
any other reason, the holders of the Notes would cease to have any claim in respect of the Notes Guarantee and would
have a claim solely under the Notes and the remaining Notes Guarantees, if any. Any amounts obtained from transactions
that have been voided would have to be repaid.

**_Uruguay_**

In general and according to Uruguayan laws, any creditor may request that the court nullify or invalidate any
contract that was executed with the intent to defraud, delay or hinder creditors. Furthermore, the Notes Guarantee granted
by the Uruguayan Guarantor may also be considered null or void if it is shown that the Uruguayan Guarantor did not
receive a fair value for the Notes Guarantee or that there was no reasonable purpose for the Notes Guarantee.

Additionally, according to Uruguay's Insolvency and Bankruptcy Law N° 18.387 article 82, upon a declaration
of insolvency, a creditor is entitled to request the withdrawal of any act of the debtor executed in the two years prior to
the insolvency declaration which hinders its claim if the debtor acted with fraudulent intent to harm the creditor's rights,
and the contracting party was aware or should have been aware that the debtor was insolvent.

Furthermore, the courts may declare null and void the following acts executed by the debtor: (i) acts executed
free of charge or without reasonable compensation within the two years prior to the declaration of insolvency by the
court, not including ordinary gifts and other presents and remunerative donations to employees; (ii) any in rem guarantee
over any asset of the debtor, executed within the six months prior to the declaration of insolvency, for claims not due or
to secure a new obligation executed immediately after a previous obligation was cancelled; (iii) any payment made by the
Debtor within the six months prior to the declaration of insolvency for claims not due; or (iv) the cancellation of any
contract within the six months prior to the declaration of insolvency.

Finally, because guarantees are ancillary to primary obligations, the nullification by the courts of a primary
obligation results in the nullification of the relevant guarantee.

372


-----

**Service of process and enforcement of judgments**

The Issuer and some of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Spain and most of the directors and
executive officers of the Issuer (or certain other persons named in this Offering Memorandum) and the Guarantors are
non- residents of the United States.

Furthermore, a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and a substantial portion of the
assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect
service of process within the United States upon those persons, the Issuer or the Guarantors, or to enforce against them
judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws.

**Argentina**

Any final judgment obtained in Spain or abroad arising out of or in relation to the obligations of each Argentine
subsidiary under the Notes Guarantees, would be enforced against each of the Argentine subsidiary in the courts of
Argentina by means of an Exequatur process; provided that the following requirements of Section 517 of Argentine Law
No. 17,454, as amended by Argentine Law No. 22,434 (National Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure) are satisfied:
(i) the judgment, which must be final in the jurisdiction where rendered, was issued by a court competent in accordance
with the Argentine conflict of laws principles regarding jurisdiction and resulted from a personal action, or an in rem
action with respect to personal property which was transferred to Argentine territory during or after the prosecution of the
foreign action; (ii) the defendant against whom enforcement of the final judgment is sought was personally served with
the summons and, in accordance with due process of law, was given an opportunity to defend against the foreign action,
(iii) the final judgment must be valid in the jurisdiction where rendered and its authenticity must be established in
accordance with the requirements of Argentine law, (iv) the final judgment does not violate the principles of public
policy of Argentine law and (v) the final judgment is not contrary to a prior or simultaneous final judgment of an
Argentine court.

**Austria**

_Recognition and enforcement of foreign legal titles (Non-EU member states)_

According to Section 406 of the Enforcement Act (Exekutionsordnung), foreign acts and instruments shall be
declared enforceable in Austria if they are enforceable under the law of the foreign state in which they are drawn up and
reciprocity is guaranteed by bilateral or multilateral treaties or regulations.

There is neither a bilateral treaty in force between Austria and the United States nor a practice of reciprocal
recognition of Austrian judgments in the United States. Accordingly, judgments rendered by a U.S. court against the
Issuer or any of the Guarantors in the United States cannot be recognized and thus cannot be enforced in Austria. Such
judgment may only be used as evidence in proceedings in Austria to enforce the claim already adjudicated in the United
States. Such a trial in Austria is not barred on the grounds of the U.S. court's decision on the same matter.

_Recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments of EU member states_

Any judgment obtained against the Issuer or any other Guarantors in one of the EU member states, except
Denmark, shall be enforced in Austria in accordance with the Council Regulation (EU) No 1215/2015 of December 12,
2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters ("Brussels la
Regulation"). The Brussels I Regulation provides that a judgment given in an EU country is to be recognized and
enforced in another EU country without special proceedings being required. "Judgment" means any judgment given by a
court or tribunal of an EU member state, whatever the judgment may be called, including "decree", "order", "decision" or
"writ of execution". Under no circumstances will the substance of an EU foreign judgment be reviewed.

An EU foreign judgment will not be recognized if:

    - such recognition is manifestly contrary to public policy in the EU county in which recognition is
sought;

    - the defendant was not served with the document that instituted the proceedings in sufficient time and in
such way as to enable the defendant to arrange for his or her defense;

    - it is irreconcilable with a judgment given in a dispute between the same parties in the EU country in
which recognition is sought;

373


-----

    - it is irreconcilable with an earlier judgment given in another EU or non-EU country involving the same
cause of action and the same parties;

    - (i) the decision has been taken in violation of the provisions on the jurisdiction according to Article 10
to 23 of Brussels la Regulation and the defendant was an insurance holder, an insured, a beneficiary of
the insurance contract, a consumer, an employee or a damaged third party or (ii) a court would have
been exclusively competent according to Article 24 of Brussels la Regulation and the decision has been
taken by another court.

According to prevalent doctrine, there is no option to close the gap on the currently impossible enforcement of
U.S. judgments in Austria by having such judgment recognized in another EU member state (EuGH Rs 129/92, Owens
Bank/Bracco, Slg 1994, I-117). Third-country judgments, such as U.S. court judgments, will not be enforceable in
Austria by way of taking a detour through the foreign judgment recognition system of another EU member state.

**Belgium**

The recognition and enforceability in Belgium of foreign judgments depend first on the existence of bilateral or
multilateral treaties with the state where the foreign judgment has been rendered, except for certain European countries
(as described below). Such a treaty does not currently exist between Belgium and the United States.

If a foreign judgment has been rendered in a state that is a member of the European Union, recognition and
enforcement of the judgment in Belgium is governed by Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and
of the Council of December 12, 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and
commercial matters.

In the event a foreign judgment is ruled neither by a bilateral or multilateral treaty nor by a European regulation,
such judgment obtained against a Belgian Guarantor or a Belgian security provider outside of Europe and, in particular,
in the United States would be recognized and enforced in accordance with the Belgian Code of International Private Law,
by the courts of Belgium, unless:

    - the consequences of the recognition or enforcement of such foreign judgment would be manifestly
contrary to the Belgian public order;

    - the rights of defense have been violated;

    - if in relation to matters for which parties cannot freely dispose of their rights, the decision has been
sought with the sole purpose of escaping from the application of the laws applicable in accordance with
Belgian conflict of law rules;

    - without prejudice to Article 23.4 of the Belgian Code of International Private Law, the foreign
judgment is not final or does not meet the requirements of authenticity pursuant to the laws of the State
where the judgment was rendered or the applicable federal rules;

    - the judgment is irreconcilable with a Belgian judgment or a foreign judgment previously rendered
which could be recognized in Belgium;

    - the foreign procedure had been started after the start of a procedure in Belgium between the same
parties and with the same object;

    - Belgian courts have exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the case;

    - the jurisdiction of the foreign judge was based solely on the presence of the defendant or assets in such
state without any further connection with the litigation in such state; or

    - the foreign judgment is in conflict with the rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions
in relation to insolvency proceedings or corporate standing.

Any party wishing to have a foreign judgment (not ruled by a bilateral or multilateral treaty nor by European
regulation) recognized or enforced in Belgium must file an application seeking declaration of the recognition or
enforceability of the foreign judgment (exequatur) with the relevant Belgian Court of First Instance in accordance with

374


-----

the procedure set out in articles 22 et seq. of the Belgian Code of International Private Law and must submit to the court
the following documents, translated by a sworn translator, in French or Dutch as the case may be, and duly apostilled:

    - an original copy of the judgment fulfilling all conditions required for its authentication according to the
rules of the state where the judgment had been rendered;

    - any document evidencing that, following the rules of the state where the judgment had been rendered,
the judgment is enforceable and had been appropriately sent to the defendant; and

    - if the judgment had been rendered by default, the original or a certified true copy of the document
evidencing that the originating process has been served on the defendant in accordance with the
applicable foreign law.

**Chile**

Any judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors outside of Chile will be recognized and
enforced in accordance with the Chilean Civil Procedure Code ("CPC") by the courts of Chile once the Chilean Supreme
Court has granted consent (exequatur). Exequatur will be granted if the foreign judgment fulfills the following requisites:

(1) it has been granted according to the provisions of any applicable treaty;

(2) in the absence of any such treaty, it can be proven that the jurisdiction in which the foreign judgment was
rendered recognizes Chilean judgments on a reciprocal basis;

(3) in the absence of any such treaty and where reciprocity has not been evidenced, the judgment would be enforced
in Chile provided the following joint requirements are met in compliance with Article 245 of the CPC:

(i) the judgment does not contradict Chilean laws; however, procedural laws will be disregarded for this
purpose;

(ii) the judgment does not oppose Chilean jurisdiction and the principles and laws that govern Chilean
justice administration;

(iii) the party against whom the judgment is intended to be enforced has been properly served; and

(iv) the judgment is final, without the possibility of further appeals (ejecutoriado).

Once the exequatur has been granted, enforcement of the foreign ruling must be filed before the local court that
would have been competent to deal with the case had the plaintiff sued in Chile.

**The Czech Republic**

Any judgment rendered against the Czech Guarantor outside of the Czech Republic would be recognized and
enforced in accordance with Act No. 99/1963 Coll., on Civil Procedure, as amended, by the Czech courts in the
following three situations:

    - according to the provisions of any applicable valid and effective bilateral treaty on the recognition and
enforcement of foreign judgments with a particular state; there being none currently in existence
between the Czech Republic and the United States for these purposes;

    - according to the provisions of any applicable valid and effective multilateral treaty on the recognition
and enforcement of foreign judgments, such as the Lugano Convention, applicable in respect of
Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Denmark;

    - in the absence of any such treaty, the judgments of foreign courts may be recognized and enforced in
accordance with Czech Act No. 91/2012 Coll., on Private International Law, as amended ("Czech Act
on PIL"); the investor may seek enforcement of a foreign judgment in the Czech Republic without
having to undergo any special "recognition" procedure (no exequatur takes place). The Czech court
ordering enforcement of a foreign judgment will, however, assess whether there is any circumstance
preventing recognition of such foreign judgment. Under the Czech Act on PIL, the exceptions
preventing recognition of a foreign judgment include the following situations:

375


-----

(i) the decided matter falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Czech courts or in cases where the
proceedings would not be allowed to be conducted before a body of a state other than the Czech
Republic, if the Czech provisions regarding jurisdiction were used to assess the jurisdiction of the
foreign deciding body (unless the participant in the proceedings, against whom the judgment is made,
has voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the foreign authority);

(ii) proceedings are pending before a Czech court with regard to the same legal relationship and if such
proceedings commenced prior to the proceedings abroad, in which the judgement whose recognition
has been proposed was issued;

(iii) _res iudicata (either a Czech court already decided in the same matter or recognized in another foreign_
judgment);

(iv) a party to the proceedings, against which the decision is to be recognized, was prevented by a foreign
authority from due participation in the foreign proceedings (in particular, it was not invited to the
complaint, or the action against such party was not delivered "to its own hands");

(v) _ordre public (the recognition would be evidently contrary to the Czech public order);_

(vi) there is no reciprocity granted (which is currently the case in relation to the United States of America).

_Enforcement within the EU Member States_

Any judgment obtained by the Czech Guarantor in any country bound by the provisions of Council Regulation
(EC) No. 1215/2012 of December 12, 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and
commercial matters ("Brussels I bis Regulation") would be recognized and enforced in accordance with the terms set
forth thereby. Brussels I bis Regulation is directly applicable.

According to Brussels I bis Regulation a judgment rendered and enforceable in any EU Member State shall be
automatically recognized and enforced in the other EU Member States without any special procedure being required.

**France**

The United States and France are not party to any bilateral treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment
rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or
state securities laws, enforceable in the United States, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party
in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (procédure d'exequatur) in France
before the relevant civil court (Tribunal de Grande Instance) having jurisdiction. Enforcement in France of such U.S.
judgment can be obtained following adversary proceedings if the civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have
been met, which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French court on the merits
of the foreign judgment:

    - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter in accordance with
French rules of international conflicts of jurisdiction, including, without limitation, whether the dispute
is clearly connected to the United States, and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over
the matter;

    - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the
merits (i.e., fundamental principles of French law) and to the procedure of the case;

    - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent; and

    - such U.S. judgment does not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment which has become
effective in France, and there are no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement
of the judgment is sought having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be affected by the reserves
France inserted in its Act of Adherence, as amended on January 19, 1987, to the Hague Convention of March 18, 1970.

376


-----

According to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, in the event that a party brings an action outside
France against a French national, either a company or an individual, French courts may still have non-exclusive
jurisdiction over such French national, who has French citizenship at the time the suit is filed. In addition, a French
national may decide to bring an action before the French courts, regardless of the nationality of the defendant. However,
the French national may waive its right to bring an action before a French court against a non-French defendant.

**Germany**

Certain Guarantors, namely NH Central Europe GmbH & Co. KG, NH Hotelbetriebs.-u. Dienstleistungs,
GmbH, NH Hoteles Deutschland GmbH, NH Hotelbetriebs-u Entwicklungs, GmbH and JOLLY HOTELS
DEUTSCHLAND GmbH are incorporated under the laws of Germany and have their registered offices in Germany. Any
judgment obtained against any of these Guarantors in an ordinary court outside Germany (and, in particular, in the United
States) would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. However, a final judgment for payment rendered by a U.S.
federal or state court based on civil liability may be recognized and enforced in Germany under the following
circumstances:

    - according to the provisions of any applicable treaty; please note, however, that the United States and
Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments in civil and commercial matters other than arbitration awards; or

    - in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the
German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung); in this kind of action, a German court
generally would not reinvestigate or re-litigate the original matter decided by the foreign court, except
as noted below; the recognition and enforcement of the foreign judgment by a German court, however,
depends upon a number of prerequisites:

(i) the judgment is final under U.S. law;

(ii) the U.S. court had jurisdiction over the original proceeding pursuant to the principles of jurisdictional
competence according to German law;

(iii) the document serving the proceedings was duly made known to the defendant in a timely fashion that
allowed for adequate defense unless the defendant did appear in the proceedings and did not recourse to
not being notified of the proceedings in a timely fashion that allowed for adequate defense;

(iv) the judgment of the U.S. court is not in contradiction to the judgment issued by a German court or any
prior judgment of a foreign court which is to be recognized in Germany and the proceeding having led
to the respective U.S. judgment is not in contradiction to any prior proceeding pending in Germany;

(v) the recognition of the judgment by the U.S. court is not in evident contradiction to German public
policy, including the fundamental principles of German law, and in particular, the recognition is not in
contradiction to the fundamental constitutional rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by the German
Constitutional Act (Grundgesetz); and

(vi) the reciprocity of recognition and enforcement of judgments is guaranteed.

Subject to the foregoing, judgments in civil and commercial matters awarding payment claims against
Guarantors obtained from U.S. courts may be enforced in Germany. However, there is no guarantee that attempts to
enforce judgments in Germany will be successful.

German courts usually refuse to recognize and enforce punitive damages awarded by a foreign court, including a
state or federal court of the United States. Furthermore, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a
foreign court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

German civil procedure may differ substantially from civil procedure of other jurisdictions in a number of
respects. In particular, as far as the production of evidence is concerned, the laws of certain other jurisdictions, including
the laws of the United States, provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may request
the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses prior to trial. Evidence obtained
in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No equivalent pre-trial discovery process exists under
German law.

377


-----

"Enforceable", or "Enforce(d)" or other grammatical forms of these, as used above, mean that each obligation or
document is of a type enforced (vollstreckt) by the German courts. It is not certain, however, that each obligation or
document will be enforced in accordance with its terms in every circumstance, enforcement being subject to, inter alia,
the nature of remedies available in the German courts, the acceptance by such court of jurisdiction, the discretion of the
courts (within the limits of German law), the power of such courts to stay proceedings, the provisions of the German
rules on civil procedure regarding remedies and enforcement measures available under German law. Also, if
circumstances have arisen after the date on which such foreign judgment became res judicata, a defense against execution
may arise. Enforcement may further be limited by general principles of equity and good faith. The success of
enforcement is also affected by possible bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or a moratorium as well as
other similar legal circumstances affecting creditor's rights generally.

**Italy**

The following discussion with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in Italy is based upon
advice provided to us by our Italian legal advisors. The United States and Italy currently do not have a bilateral treaty
providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and
commercial matters.

Notwithstanding the above, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United
States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be recognized by an
Italian court without a re-trial, if the following conditions are met:

    - the U.S. court which rendered the final judgment had jurisdiction according to Italian law principles of
jurisdiction;

    - the relevant summons and complaint were appropriately served on the defendants in accordance with
U.S. law and during the proceeding the essential rights of the defendants have not been violated;

    - the judgment is final and not subject to any further appeal in accordance with U.S. law;

    - the parties to the proceeding appeared before the court in accordance with U.S. law or, in the event of
default by the defendants, the U.S. court declared such default in accordance with U.S. law;

    - the U.S. judgment is not in conflict with any final judgment previously rendered by an Italian court;

    - there is no action pending in the Republic of Italy among the same parties and arising from the same
facts and circumstances which commenced prior to the action in the United States; and

    - the provisions of such judgment would not violate Italian public policy.

In addition, if an original action is brought before an Italian court, the Italian court may refuse to apply U.S. law
provisions or to grant some of the remedies sought (e.g., punitive damages) if their application violates Italian public
policy.

In cases of noncompliance with or objection to the recognition of a U.S. judgment, or when it is necessary to
proceed with forceful execution, any interested person may apply to the court of appeals of the location of
implementation for a determination of the existence of the recognition prerequisites above. The U.S. judgment, jointly
with the decision allowing the application referred to above, constitutes entitlement to the implementation and forceful
execution. If the objection to the U.S. judgment is raised in the context of other proceedings pending in Italy, the decision
on the objection is made by the Italian judge with effects limited to those proceedings only.

The enforcement and, more generally, the use in court of guarantees (fideiussioni), which have been executed
unilaterally by the guarantor or abroad, is currently subject to Italian registration tax (governed by Presidential Decree—
D.P.R. April 26, 1986, n. 131) at the rate of the 0.5% of the guaranteed amount, unless such tax has already been
previously paid.

In addition to the foregoing, the enforcement in Italy of a judgment issued by a foreign court, similar to
judgments rendered by Italian courts, is currently subject to Italian registration tax at the following rates:

378


-----

    - 3% in the case of judgments ordering the payment of an amount of money, the performance of a
service or the delivery of assets (provided that the payment or the performance of the service was not
subject to Italian VAT according to the VAT vs. registration tax alternative principle)[(1)];

(1) According to the VAT vs. registration tax alternative principle, registration tax is levied at the fixed amount of €200 if the performance of
the service falls under the scope of Italian VAT in Italy. Performance of services are regarded as being under the scope of Italian VAT even
though they are not subject to Italian VAT because they do not fulfill the territorial requirement.

    - 1% in the case of judgments that ascertain rights having an economical value; and

    - a fixed fee of approximately €200 in the case of judgments different from those indicated above or
which declare any deed null or void, including judgments ordering the restitution of an amount of
money or assets.

In original actions brought before Italian courts, there is doubt as to the enforceability of liabilities or remedies
based solely on the U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, in original actions brought before Italian courts, Italian
courts may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of Italian law that are
regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply U.S. law provisions if the relevant application violates Italian public
policy.

**Luxembourg**

_Enforcement of judgments_

Although there is no treaty between Luxembourg and the United States regarding the reciprocal enforcement of
judgments, a valid, final and conclusive judgment against a guarantor formed in Luxembourg obtained from a state or
federal court of the United States, which judgment remains in full force and effect, may be enforced through a court of
competent jurisdiction in Luxembourg, subject to compliance with the enforcement procedures (exequatur) as set out in
the relevant provisions of the Luxembourg New Code of Civil Procedure and in the Luxembourg case law. Pursuant to
Luxembourg case law, the granting of exequatur is subject to the following requirements:

    - the foreign court must properly have had jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter, both according
to its own laws and to the Luxembourg international private law conflict of jurisdiction rules;

    - the foreign court must have applied the law which is designated by the Luxembourg conflict of laws
rules or, at least, the order must not contravene the principles underlying those rules;

    - the decision of the foreign court must be final and enforceable (exécutoire) in the jurisdiction in which
it was rendered;

    - the foreign court must have applied the proper law to the matter submitted to it and the foreign
procedure must have been regular in light of the laws of the country of origin;

    - the decision of the foreign court must not have been obtained by fraud, but in compliance with the
rights of the defendant and in compliance with its own procedural laws; and

    - the decisions and the considerations of the foreign court must not be contrary to Luxembourg
international public policy rules or have been given in proceedings of a tax, penal or criminal nature
(which would include awards of damages made under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal
securities laws, or other laws, to the extent that the same would be classified by Luxembourg courts as
being of a penal or punitive nature (for example, fines or punitive damages)) or rendered subsequent to
an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi). Ordinarily an award of monetary damages would not
be considered as a penalty, but if the monetary damages include punitive damages such punitive
damages may be considered as a penalty).

If an original action is brought in Luxembourg, without prejudice to specific conflict of law rules, Luxembourg
courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of such foreign law was not made bona fide or (ii) if the
foreign law was not pleaded and proved or (iii) if pleaded and proved, such foreign law was contrary to mandatory
Luxembourg laws or incompatible with Luxembourg public policy rules. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the

379


-----

basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies
sought.

In practice, Luxembourg courts now tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment, although there is no
clear statutory prohibition of such review.

In a judgment of the Luxembourg District Court, dated January 10, 2008, the Court differed slightly from the
traditional rules for enforcing a judgment described above, and decided that, in order to enforce a foreign judgment in
Luxembourg, a Luxembourg judge has to make sure that three conditions are fulfilled: (1) the "indirect" competence of
the foreign judge based on the connection of the litigation with such judge, (2) the conformity with international public
policy requirements, both substantive and procedural, and (3) the absence of fraud to the law. In the judgment, the
District Court held that the Luxembourg judge does not need to verify that the (substantive) law applied by the foreign
judge is the law which would have been applicable according to Luxembourg conflict of law rules.

Whether the District Court's opinion described above will develop into the prevailing position of Luxembourg
case law cannot be forecast with certainty at this stage, having taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case,
there has been no further case law on the issue since then. To the extent, however, that the District Court's decision
endorsed the solution prevailing in French case law, its decision might, in the future, be endorsed by the Luxembourg
courts in general.

_Service of process_

A contractual provision allowing the service of process against a guarantor or a security grantor incorporated in
Luxembourg to any other party appointed to such effect could be overridden by Luxembourg statutory provisions
allowing the valid service of process against such guarantor or a security grantor incorporated in Luxembourg in
accordance with applicable laws at their registered office.

_Registration in Luxembourg_

The registration of the notes, the indentures, the guarantees and the transaction documents (and any document in
connection therewith) with the Administration de l’Enregistrement et des Domaines et de la TVA in Luxembourg may be
required should the indentures, the guarantees and the transaction documents (and any documents in connection
therewith) be (i) used, or referred to, in a notarial deed, a bailiff deed or another public deed, or before a Luxembourg
court (théorie de l'usage), (ii) attached as an annex (annexé(s)) to a public deed subject to mandatory registration
mentioned under (i), or (iii) lodged with the notary's records (déposés au rang des minutes d'un notaire). . In such case,
either a nominal registration duty or an ad valorem duty (or, for instance, 0.24% of the amount of the payment obligation
mentioned in the document so registered) may be payable depending on the nature of the document to be registered, or in
the case of voluntary registration. A Luxembourg court or an official Luxembourg authority may require that the
indentures, the guarantees and the transaction documents (and any documents in connection therewith) and any judgment
obtained in a foreign court be translated into French or German.

The Luxembourg courts or the official Luxembourg authority may require that the notes, the security interest
agreements, the indentures, the guarantees and the transaction documents (and any document in connection therewith)
and any judgment obtained in a foreign court be translated into French or German.

**Mexico**

Service of process in relation to claims processed in foreign courts on individuals or companies domiciled in
Mexico, should be requested by the foreign court and transmitted through authorized means (international treaties might
apply). In any case, service of process shall be carried out by the Mexican court with jurisdiction in the defendant's
domicile and according to Mexican rules of procedure.

Judgements rendered by courts of a foreign country might be recognized and enforced by Mexican courts under
the rules of the Mexican Federal Procedure Code and/or applicable international treaties. In general terms, according to
the Mexican Federal Procedure Code, for foreign judgment to be recognized and enforced in Mexico, it must fulfill the
following requirements: (a) the foreign court had proper jurisdiction and venue; (b) defendant was personally served;
(c) the judgement is final (rex judicata) pursuant to the applicable legal provisions of the jurisdiction in which it was
passed; and (d) does not contravene matters of public policy in Mexico. Foreign judgments shall be subject to legal
procedure in Mexico before enforcement.

380


-----

**The Netherlands**

Service of process in U.S. proceedings on persons in the Netherlands is regulated by a multilateral treaty
guaranteeing service of writs and other legal documents in civil cases if the current address of the defendant is known. A
competent Dutch court will apply Dutch private international law to determine which law applies to any private law
claim brought before it and apply that law to such claim. It is uncertain whether a Dutch court would apply or enforce the
civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws and U.S. civil law in general.

Any judgment obtained in a civil or commercial matter against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors by a U.S.
court cannot be directly enforced in the Netherlands. However, if a person has obtained a final and conclusive judgment
for the payment of money in such a matter rendered by a U.S. court which is enforceable in the United States and files a
claim with the competent Dutch court, the Dutch court will generally give binding effect to the foreign judgment;
provided that (a) the judgment has been rendered on grounds which are internationally acceptable, (b) proper legal
procedures have been observed, (c) the foreign judgment does not contravene Dutch public policy and (d) the judgment is
not irreconcilable with a judgment of a Dutch court or an earlier judgment of a foreign court that is capable of being
recognized in the Netherlands.

The Dutch courts will express any judgment in respect of a claim against the Issuer or a Guarantor expressed in
a currency other than euro, in the currency of the claim or in euro, at the option of the creditor of the claim.

Any judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors in any country bound by the provisions of
EU Regulation number 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on jurisdiction and enforcement of
judgments in civil and commercial matters will be recognized and enforced in the Netherlands in accordance with and
subject to that regulation. A foreign judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands and expressed in a currency other
than euro may, at the option of the person enforcing the judgment, be enforced in euro.

**Poland**

Any judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors outside of Poland (and, in particular, in the
United States) would be recognized and enforced in accordance with the Polish Civil Procedure Code in the courts of
Poland. As a general rule of the Polish Civil Procedure Code, judgments of foreign courts in civil cases are recognized by
virtue of law, however, a judgment cannot be recognized in Poland if:

(1) it is not final and non-revisable in the state where it was issued;

(2) it was issued in a case which falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of Polish courts;

(3) the defendant who did not defend on the merits of the case had not been duly served with an originating
pleading in sufficient time to enable him to arrange for his defense;

(4) a party was deprived of the possibility to defend the proceedings;

(5) an action involving the same claim between the same parties had been brought before a court in Poland before it
was brought before a court of a foreign state;

(6) it is irreconcilable with an earlier final and non-revisable judgment of a Polish court or an earlier final nonrevisable judgment of a court of a foreign state recognized in Poland, given in a case involving the same claim
between the same parties;

(7) such recognition would be contrary to the fundamental principles of the Polish legal order (public policy clause).

Any party with a legal standing is entitled to file a motion with the relevant Polish District Court for
conformation that a given judgment may or may not be recognized in Poland.

Any party wishing to have a U.S. judgment enforceable in Poland must file an application seeking declaration of
enforceability of the U.S. judgment which must be filed with the relevant Polish District Court.

Any judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors in any country bound by the provisions of
EU Regulation number 44/2011 of the Council on jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial
matters would be recognized and enforced in accordance with the terms set forth thereby.

381


-----

**Portugal**

Any judgment obtained against the Portuguese Guarantor outside of Portugal (and, in particular, in the United
States), other than in a country bound by the provisions of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament
and of the European Council of December 12, 2012, on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in
civil and commercial matters, would be recognized and enforced in accordance with the Portuguese Code of Civil
Procedure. The requirements for a foreign decision to be confirmed, defined in the Code of Civil Procedure, include the
following:

(1) _Authenticity and propriety. There must be no doubt about the authenticity of the document in which the foreign_
judgment is contained or about the propriety of the decision. According to the principle of locus regit actum, the
authenticity of the document must be established in accordance with the law of its country of origin. The
decision must be authenticated by a Portuguese consulate and then translated. The translation must be
authenticated by a notary public or a Portuguese consulate.

(2) _Final judgment. The judgment must be definitive and final under the law of the country in which it was issued_
(i.e., it may not be subject to ordinary appeals). Although the party requesting recognition of the judgment does
not need to prove that it is definitive, the court of review may ask the plaintiff to prove that the decision is final.
If the court learns that the judgment is not definitive, the confirmation will be denied.

(3) _Proper jurisdiction. The decision must have been issued by a court whose jurisdiction has not been provoked in_
_fraus legis. The relevant rules establish that the international jurisdiction of Portuguese courts depends on the_
verification of several requirements, without prejudice to the rules provided in treaties, conventions, EC
regulations and special laws.

(4) _Lis pendent and res judicata. The judgment cannot be confirmed if the same action is pending before or already_
has been judged by Portuguese courts, unless the summons from the foreign court was given first. The judge
will be able to deny exequatur only if the Portuguese court was the first to receive the suit.

(5) _Service of process. The defendant must have been served process and, if the defendant did not present_
opposition, the process must have been served personally; otherwise, the judgment cannot be confirmed. It
should be noted that even if the law of the country of the court of origin dispenses with these requirements for
service of process, such dispensation is irrelevant for the purpose of determining whether the service was
proper.

(6) _Public policy. The foreign judgment may not contain any decisions that violate the principles of Portuguese_
public policy. In determining compliance with this requirement, the judge must evaluate the decision itself and
not the grounds on which it is based.

(7) _Verification by the judge. The court must verify ex officio whether conditions regarding authenticity and_
propriety, public policy and domestic private law are met. The court will deny confirmation if, during the
examination of evidence during the proceedings, or through knowledge derived through the performance of its
judicial functions, it establishes the absence of jurisdiction, lis pendens, res judicata, service of process or the
impossibility of the appeal of the judgment.

The competent court for the recognition of foreign decisions is the court of second instance (Tribunal da
_Relação) of the jurisdiction in which the Portuguese Guarantor's headquarters are located._

**Romania**

_Recognition and enforcement of judgments issued in non-EU countries_

Judgments against the Issuer or the Guarantors issued by courts of law of non-EU countries will be recognized
and enforced in Romania on the basis of the provisions of Articles 1.094-1.109 of the Romanian Civil Procedure Code,
except for the situation where between Romanian and the state issuing the decision a treaty is in force stating otherwise.
Importantly, as between Romania and United States there is no treaty regulating the enforcement of judgments, the
provisions of the Romanian Civil Procedure Code will apply.

_(a)_ _Recognition of a U.S. decision_

382


-----

According to the Romania Civil Procedure Code, in order for a judgment of a U.S. court of law to be recognized
in Romania, the following cumulative conditions have to be met:

(i) the decision is final according to U.S. law;

(ii) the U.S. court of law issuing the decision had jurisdiction on the case under the respective U.S. law
without the respective jurisdiction being established exclusively on the presence in the U.S. of the
defendant or of his/her certain assets which have no direct link to the respective proceedings;

(iii) there is reciprocity in what regards the effects of court decisions between Romania and U.S.;

(iv) in case the decision was not issued in the presence of the party losing the case, the decision ascertains
the fact that the respective party (x) was handed in due time the summons for the court hearing on the
merits of the case and the document initiating the proceedings and (y) was given the opportunity to
defend himself/herself/itself and to challenge the decisions; and

(v) there is no ground for refusal of the recognition of the decision in accordance with the Romanian Civil
Procedure Code.

The grounds for refusal are the following:

    - the decision is contrary to the public order of the Romanian international private law;

    - the decisions pronounced in a mater in which a person cannot freely dispose of his/her rights was
obtained with the exclusive purpose of eluding the applicable law established according to the
Romanian international private law;

    - a Romanian court of law already issued a decision or the proceedings are ongoing before a Romania
court of law;

    - the decision is incompatible with a decision previously pronounced by a foreign country and is
susceptible of being recognized in Romania;

    - the Romanian courts of law had exclusive jurisdiction in solving the proceedings;

    - the right to defense was breached;

    - the decision may be subject to an appeal in the U.S.

The request for the recognition of the U.S. decision will be solved by:

(i) the tribunal from the jurisdiction of the domicile or, as the case may be, headquarters of the person
refusing to recognize of the U.S. decision; or

(ii) Bucharest Tribunal, in case the competent tribunal cannot be determined on the basis of the criteria
from point (i) above.

_(b)_ _Enforcement of a U.S. decision_

According to the Romanian Civil Procedure Code, in order for a judgment of a U.S. court of law to be enforced
in Romania the following conditions have to be fulfilled:

(i) the decision must fulfil all the conditions provided by the Civil Procedure Code related to the
recognition of foreign decisions, as mentioned above under points (i)–(v);

(ii) the decision to be enforceable according to U.S. law.

The request for the enforcement of a U.S. decision will be solved by the tribunal from the jurisdiction where the
enforcement is going to take place. The tribunal will issue an enforcement decision on the basis of which the writ of
execution will be obtained.

383


-----

The amounts due according to a U.S decision will be converted by the Romanian court of law in local currency
at the exchange rate from the day the U.S. decision become enforceable. The interest until conversion date will be
governed by U.S. law.

_Recognition and enforcement of judgments issued in EU countries_

Judgments against the Issuer or the Guarantors issued by courts of law of EU countries will be enforced in
Romania on the basis of Regulation no. 1215/2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in
civil and commercial matters.

Contracts concluded under the laws of another state (including under Spanish or U.S. law) are not to be
recognized by the Romanian courts as writs of execution in Romania, therefore their enforcement against the relevant
debtors (such as the Romanian Guarantor) will be subject to obtaining a final and irrevocable court decision or arbitration
award on the merits of the case.

Enforcement against the a Romanian company will be subject to Romanian rules of civil procedure which are
the rules in force at the time of such enforcement, particularly the commencement of enforcement is subject to the prior
authorization of enforcement (Romanian: incuviintarea executarii silite) by judicial enforcement courts, in accordance
with the Civil Procedure Code.

Any receivable may be enforced against a Romanian company only for a secured amount which is certain
(Romanian: certă), determined (Romanian: lichidă), due and payable (Romanian: exigibilă) and which is not contested at
the time of the enforcement.

The provisions entitling one party to recover its legal and other enforcement costs and expenses from the other
party may be limited in terms of items or amounts as a Romanian court of law deems appropriate.

**Spain**

Under Spanish Law of Civil Procedure 1/2000 of January 7, 2000, process must be served personally on each
defendant. The Spanish Supreme Court, taking into account the circumstances of the case, may construe that service of
process on an agent appointed by the Issuer or any Guarantor incorporated in Spain has infringed Spanish public policy
or their rights of defence. Thus, a process agent shall be appointed at all times in the jurisdiction of the relevant courts for
serving of process on the Issuer or any Guarantor incorporated in Spain pursuant to Spanish Law of Civil Procedure
1/2000 of January 7, 2000.

A final judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors outside of Spain (and, in particular, in the
United States), other than in a country bound by the provisions of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European
Parliament and of the European Council of December 12, 2012, on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of
judgments in civil and commercial matters, would be recognized and enforced in accordance with the Spanish Law of
Civil Procedure 1/2000 of January 7, 2000 by the courts of Spain (unless such judgment contravenes principles of
Spanish public policy) in the following three situations:

    - according to the provisions of any applicable treaty, there being none currently in existence between
Spain and the United States for these purposes;

    - in the absence of any such treaty, if it could be proven that the jurisdiction in which the foreign
judgment was rendered (in this case, in the United States) recognizes Spanish judgments on a
reciprocal basis (positive reciprocity) and provided that certain minimum conditions are met, among
others, that there is a final judgement not subject to appeal and that the matter does not infringe public
policy and does not contradict a previous Spanish judgment. The standard of proof required by Spanish
courts regarding positive reciprocity is very high. Therefore, positive reciprocity is very seldom
recognized. However, if it could be proven (usually by the defendant) that the U.S. jurisdiction in
which the judgment was obtained does not recognize judgments issued by Spanish courts, then the
Spanish courts would not recognize the U.S. judgment in Spain (negative reciprocity); or

    - in the absence of any such treaty and where negative reciprocity has not been evidenced (and,
according to certain court precedents, even if positive reciprocity has been evidenced), the judgment
would be enforced in Spain subject to Article 523 of the Spanish Law of Civil Procedure 1/2000 of
January 7, 2000 and to the Spanish Law for International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters 29/2015

384


-----

of July 30, 2015 provided that the following conditions are met (which conditions, under prevailing
Spanish case law, do not include a review by the Spanish courts of the merits of the foreign judgment):

(i) the foreign judgment is final and conclusive;

(ii) such judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter, and when rendering the
judgment, the courts rendering it did not infringe an exclusive ground of jurisdiction provided for under
Spanish law or based their jurisdiction on exorbitant grounds and the choice of court is not fraudulent
and must be reasonably connected with the dispute;

(iii) there is no material contradiction or incompatibility with an earlier judgment rendered in Spain or in
any other state provided that such judgment complies with the applicable conditions to be enforceable
in Spain;

(iv) the rights of defense of the defendant have been protected where rendering the foreign judgment,
including but not limited to a proper service of process carried out with sufficient time for the
defendant to prepare its defense and appear before the courts;

(v) the foreign judgment was not rendered by default (i.e. without appearance or without the possibility to
appear for the defendant);

(vi) the foreign judgment does not contravene Spanish public policy or mandatory provisions and the
obligation to be fulfilled is legal in Spain;

(vii) there are no ongoing or pending proceedings between the same parties and dealing with the same
subject that were opened before a Spanish court prior to the opening of the proceedings before the
foreign court ;

(viii) there shall not be a judgment rendered between the same parties and for the same cause of action in
Spain or in another country provided that in this latter case the judgment satisfies the conditions to be
enforceable in Spain;

(ix) to the extent the party against which the judgment is enforced in Spain has been declared insolvent, the
foreign judgment must comply with the requirements provided for in the Spanish Insolvency Law
approved by Royal Legislative Decree 1/2020, of May 5;

(x) the documentation prepared for the purposes of requesting the enforcement of the judgment is
accompanied by a translation into Spanish in accordance with Article 144 of the Spanish Law of Civil
Procedure 1/2000 of January 7, 2000;

(xi) the copy of the judgment presented to the Spanish court has the apostille properly affixed; and

(xii) although reciprocity is not a legal requirement, if it were proven that the foreign jurisdiction (e.g. the
United States) in which the judgment was obtained does not enforce judgments issued by Spanish
courts on a general basis, then the Spanish courts could be compelled to deny the enforcement of the
foreign judgment in Spain.

According to Article 3.2 of Spanish Law for International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters 29/2015 of July
30, 2015, the Spanish Government may deny cooperation with another state's authorities if there has been a reiterated
refusal to cooperate or a legal prohibition of providing cooperation is imposed by such other state's authorities provided
that the Spanish Government passes a Royal Decree for these purposes.

Any party wishing to have a U.S. ruling recognized or enforced in Spain must file an application seeking
declaration of the enforceability of the U.S. resolution (exequatur) which must be filed with the relevant Spanish First
Instance Court (Juzgado de Primera Instancia) or Commercial Court (Juzgado de lo Mercantil), as the case may be.

The competence to hear applications for recognition and authorization for enforcement of foreign judgments in
Spain corresponds to the trial courts of the domicile of the party against which the recognition or enforcement is sought,
or of the person who referred to the effects of the foreign judgment. Secondarily, the territorial jurisdiction shall be

385


-----

determined by the place of execution or the place in which resolution should produce its effects, being competent, in the
latter case, the First Instance Court before which stands the application for recognition.

Once a judgment has been recognized under the exequatur procedure, it will be enforceable in Spain in
accordance with the Spanish Law of Civil Procedure 1/2000 of January 7, 2000; in particular, the deadline for filing
enforcement requests will be applicable (five years).

The Spanish courts may express any such order in a currency other than euro in respect of the amount due and
payable by the Issuer or Guarantors or may convert such amount into euro on the date of discharge of such judgment (at
the exchange rate prevailing on the date on which such amount became due and payable), but in case of enforcement in
Spain, the court costs and interest shall be payable in euro as per Article 577 of the Spanish Law of Civil Procedure
1/2000 of January 7, 2000. Any judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors in any country bound by
the provisions of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the European Council of
December 12, 2012, on jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters would be recognized
and enforced in accordance with the terms set forth thereby.

The enforcement of any judgments in Spain involves, among others, the following principal actions and costs:
(a) documents in a language other than Spanish must be accompanied by a sworn translation into Spanish (translator's
fees will be payable); (b) foreign documents may need to be legalized and apostilled; (c) payment of certain professional
fees required for the verification of the legal authority of a party litigating in Spain (if needed); (d) the payment of certain
court fees and/or judicial taxes; (e) the procedural acts of a party litigating in Spain must be directed by an attorney-atlaw and the party must be represented by a court agent (procurador); and (f) the content and validity of foreign law must
be evidenced to the Spanish courts (which could entail additional costs). In addition, Spanish civil proceedings rules
cannot be amended by agreement of the parties and will therefore prevail notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
in the Indenture or the Notes.

It has to be noted that Spain and the U.S. are part of the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Financial
and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965.

Furthermore, recognition and enforcement proceedings under Spanish courts may be affected by the emergency
measures taken by the Spanish Government in the framework of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could be updated from
time to time.

**Switzerland**

Judgments obtained against any of the Swiss Guarantors outside of Switzerland and, in particular, in the United
States may be recognized in Switzerland before a court of competent jurisdiction through enforcement proceedings in
accordance with the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht).
Judgments obtained in any country bound by the provisions of the Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and
enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (Lugano-Übereinkommen) would be recognized and enforced
in accordance with the terms set forth in this convention. If the judgment concerns a monetary payment or a security
(Geldzahlung oder Sicherheitsleistung), the enforcement proceedings are additionally governed by the Swiss Federal Act
on Debt Collection and Insolvency (Bundesgesetz über Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs). The judgment of a Swiss court
or authority of first instance concerning recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment, including a U.S. Judgment,
is generally subject to appeal.

If a treaty concerning the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments exists between Switzerland and the
other country in question, the recognition and enforcement of the foreign judgment would primarily be subject to the
provisions of such treaty. The United States and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, the
recognition and enforcement of a judgement obtained against any of the Swiss Guarantors is likely to be governed by the
Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law.

In a proceeding based on the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das
_internationale Privatrecht) regarding the recognition and/or enforcement of a foreign judgment, a Swiss court generally_
would not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the foreign court. The recognition and enforcement of
a foreign judgment by a Swiss court would be conditional upon a number of conditions including those set out in
articles 25 et seqq. of the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale
_Privatrecht), which include:_

    - the foreign court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings from a Swiss perspective;

386


-----

    - the judgment being final under the relevant foreign law, and no ordinary legal remedy being available
against such judgment;

    - the defendant having had the chance to defend herself or himself against any unduly or untimely served
complaint, except for a defendant having unconditionally consented to the original proceeding before
the respective court;

    - the original proceeding not having been conducted under a violation of material principles of Swiss
civil proceedings law (formeller schweizerischer Ordre public), in particular the right to be heard;

    - the matter (Verfahren) resulting in the judgment of the foreign court not being identical to a matter
(Verfahren) pending before a Swiss court; provided such Swiss matter was pending before a Swiss
court prior to the foreign court entering its proceedings;

    - the matter (Verfahren) resulting in the judgement of the foreign court being identical to a matter
(Verfahren) which has already been conclusively resolved by a court in Switzerland or by a court in a
third country, whose decision is recognizable Switzerland; and

    - the enforcement of the judgment by the foreign court not being manifestly incompatible with Swiss
public policy (materieller _schweizerischer Ordre public). The recognition and enforcement of punitive_
damage awards may be denied by Swiss courts as incompatible with Swiss public policy (materieller
_schweizerischer Ordre public). Alternatively, a Swiss court may reduce the amount of damages granted_
by a foreign court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate
actual losses or damages.

From a Swiss law perspective, a foreign court or authority is deemed to have had jurisdiction over a proceeding
in the following cases:

    - if a provision of the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law so provides or, in the absence of
such provision, if the defendant had its legal domicile in the country in which the judgment was
rendered;

    - if the parties, in a pecuniary dispute, entered into an agreement valid under the Swiss Federal Act on
International Private Law submitting their dispute to the jurisdiction of the court or authority which
rendered the judgment;

    - if the defendant, in a pecuniary dispute, unconditionally consented to the proceeding before the
respective court; or

    - if, in the event of a counterclaim, the court or authority which rendered the judgment had jurisdiction
over the principal claim and if there is a factual connection between the principal claim and the
counterclaim.

Any judgment obtained against any of the Swiss Guarantors outside of Switzerland in any country bound by the
provisions of the Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial
matters (Lugano-Übereinkommen) would be recognized and enforced in accordance with the terms set forth in this
convention.

Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial
matters obtained from foreign courts in Switzerland. It cannot, however, be assured that any attempts to enforce
judgments in Switzerland will be successful. Due to the nature of enforcement proceedings in Switzerland, no statement
can be made as to the time required to obtain recognition and enforcement of a judgment in Switzerland. Finally, Judicial
documents may not be served directly from abroad on a person in Switzerland (see Switzerland’s reservation to the
Hague Convention on Service Abroad of Judicial or Extra Judicial Documents in Civil and Commercial Matters
concluded on November 15, 1965) and service must be effected by way of judicial assistance.

Under Swiss law, any amount denominated in a foreign currency and ordered to be paid pursuant to a final
judgment will be enforced by Swiss debt collection authorities (Schweizerische Zwangsvollstreckungsbehörden) and
must be converted into Swiss Francs. Swiss civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of
respects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other
jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings, may

387


-----

compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the depositions of witnesses prior to trial. Evidence
obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of a proceeding. In Switzerland, no such pre-trial discovery
process exists. Instead, a Swiss court would decide upon the claims for which evidence is required from the parties and
the related burden of proof.

**Uruguay**

According to the Uruguayan General Procedure Code a foreign judgment will have in Uruguay imperative and
evidential effects and would be enforceable if it fulfills the following requirements:

(1) The judgment must fulfill all the necessary formalities to be considered authentic in the country where it was
rendered.

(2) The judgment and all the documents annexed to it must be duly legalized.

(3) The judgment and all the documents annexed to it must be duly translated if they are not written in Spanish.

(4) The court that rendered the judgment must have international jurisdiction to hear the case, according to the law
of the country of that court, and the case must not be considered of exclusive jurisdiction of the Uruguayan
courts.

(5) The defendant must have been duly notified of the case, according to the laws of the country in which the
judgment was rendered.

(6) Due process must have been granted to the defendant.

(7) The judgment must be considered res judicata according to the laws of the country in which it was rendered.

(8) The judgment must not violate the Uruguayan International Public Order.

If all the above mentioned requirements are fulfilled, the foreign judgment would be enforceable in Uruguay and
the national courts shall not analyze the merits of it.

The process starts with a filing to the Supreme Court of Justice, in which a party requests the enforceability of
the foreign judgment. After this filing, the Court will notify the defendant, who will have 20 days to respond. The
attorney who represents the government then will be heard before the court, and the court will render its decision. This
decision is not appealable. If the Supreme Court admits the enforcement of the judgment and therefore grants the
exequatur then the case will be remitted to a competent court in Uruguay for enforcement of the judgment.

All these proceedings also apply to the enforcement of arbitration awards.

###### Report on limited review of abridged interim consolidated financial statements

To the shareholders of NH Hotel Group, S.A.:

Introduction

We have performed a limited review of the accompanying abridged interim consolidated financial
statements (hereinafter, the interim financial statements) of NH Hotel Group, S.A. (hereinafter, "the
parent company") and its subsidiaries (hereinafter, "the group"), which comprise the Balance Sheets
as at March 31, 2021, and the statement of comprehensive profit and loss, statement of changes in
equity, cash flow statement and related notes, all abridged and consolidated, for the three months
period then ended. The parent company's directors are responsible for the preparation of these
interim financial statements in accordance with the requirements of International Accounting Standard
(IAS) 34, "Interim Financial Reporting", as adopted by the European Union, for the preparation of
abridged interim financial information. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim
financial statements based on our limited review.

Scope of Review

We conducted our limited review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements
2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. A
limited review of interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures.
A limited review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with legislation
governing the audit practice in Spain and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that
we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we
do not express an audit opinion on these interim financial statements.

Conclusion

Based on our limited review, that cannot be considered as an audit, nothing has come to our attention
that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim financial statements for the three months
period ended March 31, 2021 have not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the
requirements of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34, Interim Financial Reporting, as adopted
by the European Union, for the preparation of abridged interim financial statements.

Emphasis of Matter

We draw attention to Note 2, in which it is mentioned that these interim financial statements do not
include all the information required of complete consolidated financial statements prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union,
therefore the accompanying interim financial statements should be read together with the consolidated
annual accounts of the group for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our conclusion is not modified
in respect of this matter.

Other Matters

_Interim consolidated directors Report_

The accompanying interim consolidated directors' Report for the three months period ended March 31 ,
2021 contains the explanations which the parent company's directors consider appropriate regarding
the principal events of this period and their impact on the interim financial statements presented, of
which it does not form part. We have verified that the accounting information contained in this
directors' Report is in agreement with that of the interim financial statements for the three months
period ended March 31, 2021. Our work is limited to checking the interim consolidated directors'
Report in accordance with the scope mentioned in this paragraph and does not include a review of
information other than that obtained from NH Hotel Group, S.A. and its subsidiaries' accounting
records.

_Comparative figures_

The figures for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020 which are included for comparative
purposes in the interim financial statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, have
not been audited or reviewed.

###### NH Hotel Group, S.A. and Subsidiaries

 Explanatory notes to the abridged interim consolidated financial statements corresponding to the three-month period ended 31 March 2021.

I. **Information on** **the Group**

**_a)_** **_Introduction_**

NH Hotel Group, S.A. (hereinafter the "Parent Company") was incorporated as a limited company in Spain on 23
December 1981. The object of the company, as per its articles is, essentially, to operate and manage hotel establishments.
The registered office is located at no. 120 Santa Engracia (Madrid, Spain). The articles of association and additional public
information concerning the Parent Company can be consulted on its website: www.nh-hotels.com. and at its registered
office.

In addition to the operations that it undertakes directly, the Parent Company is the head of a group of subsidiaries
undertaking diverse activities and that, alongside the Parent, form the NH Group (hereinafter the "Group" or the "NH
Group"). As a result, in addition to its own individual financial statements, the Parent Company must also prepare
consolidated financial statements for the Group that include shareholdings in joint ventures and investments in associates.

At 31 March 2021, the NH Group was operating in 29 countries, with 355 hotels and 54,806 rooms, giving it a significant
presence in Europe.

The Group's consolidated financial statements for 2020 will be approved by General Shareholders' Meeting of NH Hotel
Group, S.A. to be held on 30 June 2021.

**_b)_** **_lmpactofCOVID-19_**

After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the middle of March 2020 in Europe, demand for hotels dropped drastically
due to lockdowns, travel restrictions and social distancing, which drastically affected mobility.

During the months of lockdown, isolation and intense confinement from March 2020 until the end of May 2020, around
95% of our hotels were closed and those which remained open were for charitable purposes. As a result, the second quarter
of 2020 was the quarter most affected by an extremely low level of demand.

The gradual reopening of hotels began at the end of May 2020 and was done progressively depending on recovery of
demand and with a focus on optimising profitability. In June 2020, around 60% of the hotel portfolio was open, 70% in
July, and around 80% at the end of August and September 2020.

The smooth reopening of the hotels since June 2020, after the portfolio was closed in March 2020 due to the intense
lockdown, enabled the attraction of national customers during the third quarter. The reopening, in spite of the low level of
demand due to mobility restrictions, was possible because of the flexible cost structure.

In 2020 NH Hotel Group put "Feel Safe at NH" into place in all its hotels. This is a new plan, with measures approved by
experts, to face up to the health crisis caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The Company has reviewed all its
procedures and made nearly 700 adaptations to its operating standards to preserve the health and safety of travellers and
employees worldwide. Grouped into 10 main lines of action and backed by specialists in different fields, the measures
implemented cover the digitisation of hotel services, adapting sanitation processes, including social distancing regulations
in operations and the application of personal protective equipment, among others. We also reached a collaboration
agreement with SGS, the world leader in inspection, analysis and certification, which allows us to follow up on the
measurement and diagnostics protocol established to verify that the Group's hotels are clean and safe environments.

As a result of the impact of the second and third waves of infections in Europe in the final quarter of 2020, apart from
delaying additional reopenings that had been planned for the last months of 2020, hotels were closed once again and, at
the end of December 2020, around 60% of the portfolio was open. The stricter restrictions on mobility during the final


-----

months of2020 and the first quarter of2021 resulted in a lower level of activity compared to the third quarter of last year.
Therefore, about 70% of hotels were open at the beginning of May with an average occupancy of25% in recent months.

Despite the low level of demand, its flexible operational and financial structure has enabled the Group to overcome the
major challenges. Although the challenges will continue in the first months of 2021, the Group will benefit in the first
stage ofrecovery from brand recognition, excellent locations and strong market positioning, once recovery is spearheaded
in Europe.

**_Contingency Plan_**

As a result of the exceptional circumstances that occurred after the start of the global pandemic (COVID-19) that is
affecting all countries, the Group implemented different measures and plans to adapt the business and ensure its
sustainability with the aim of minimising costs whilst hotels are closed, preserving the Company's liquidity to meet
operational needs and ensure that the recovery of the hotel activity is carried out efficiently and under maximum guarantees
in terms of health and safety.

Given the lack of visibility on the speed of business's recovery, the following discipline and cost control measures were
implemented, and continue to be implemented, to minimise operational expenses and preserve liquidity:

              - Personnel: The Group carried out adjustments, temporary lay-offs and reductions in hours and wages in hotels and
central offices caused by force majeure or production reasons. These processes continued in the final months of 2020,
and will continue during the first part of2021 in various countries. The workforce therefore continues to adapt with
temporary layoffs and salary reductions. The announced collective redundancy process has been carried out in Central
Services in Spain as part of a global plan pursuant to local legislation.

              - Operational costs: Negotiations with suppliers to reduce purchase costs, seek alternative, cheaper products and attain
improvements to payment terms. All Group staff travel suspended since March 2020. Significant reduction in
marketing and advertising costs despite the need to boost income.

              - Leases: Temporary reduction in fixed leases from the second quarter of2020 based on the health crisis scenario and
the restrictions approved by all the governments that impact on essential elements of the business. These negotiations
will continue in the first part of2021 (Note 15.3).

              - Cap Ex: The greater part of investments were stopped, except those that are legally required or in a very advanced
stage.

              - Strengthening liquidity:

                         - 275 million euros of credit lines were drawn down in March 2020.

                         - The proposed dividend for 2019 of 0.15 euros per share was withdrawn, as this would have involved an
estimated pay out of around 59 million euros.

                         - Signing in May 2020 of a three-year syndicated financing agreement for 250 million euros guaranteed
by the Instituto de Credito Oficial (ICO) in Spain (Note 10).

                         - In October 2020, the extension of the syndicated credit line maturity date to March 2023 was agreed. It
originally due to mature in September 2021, with a limit of236 million euros (Note 10).

                         - Likewise, and additionally, the waiver obtained in June 2020 for compliance with the financial covenants
included in the syndicated credit line for June and December 2020, unanimous approval was obtained
from the financial lenders for said waiver to be extended until June 2021. This waiver until June 2021
has also been extended to the syndicated loan (Note 10).

                         - Additionally, the Group is working on an operation that includes a set of measures - part of which are
already formalised at the date of these interim financial statements - aimed at strengthening its capital
structure and refinancing its main financing sources that mature in 2023 so as to strengthen liquidity and
provide the group with a stable financial position with a maturity profile that allows it to address the


-----

challenges arising from recovering its activity from a solid platfonn, by extending the maturity of the
ICO financing until 2026 (Note 19), the waiver on compliance with financial ratios (Note 19), convertible
unsecured subordinated loan by a subsidiary of the ma,jority shareholder for JOO million euros (Note 19),
the analysis of available alternatives in financial markets to optimise and make all its corporate debt
instruments more flexible and possible asset sales through "sale and lease-back" operations.

Recovery of demand will occur once spread of the virus is tempered and vaccination is extended in the population. The
Group will take advantage of its strong positioning in Europe, with excellent locations and high brand recognition,
alongside the high weight of domestic demand.

For more information on the Contingency Plan, see the section "Impacts ofCOVID-19 and the measures implemented" of
the Interim Consolidated Management Report for the three-month period ended 31 March 2021.

with the International Financial Reporting Standards (hereinafter, IFRS) previously adopted by the European Union.

The Group's consolidated financial statements for 2020 were prepared by the directors of the Parent Company in
accordance with the provisions of the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union,
applying the principles of consolidation, accounting policies and measurement criteria described in Note 4 of the report on
said consolidated financial statements, so that they provide a true and fair view of the consolidated equity and consolidated
financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2020 and the consolidated results from its operations, the changes in
consolidated equity and consolidated cash flows for the year ended on this date.

These abridged interim consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with International Accounting

Standard (IAS) 34 on Interim Financial Information, and were prepared by the Directors of the Parent Company on I 2
May 2021.

In accordance with the provisions of IAS 34, the interim financial report is drawn up only for the purposes ofupdating the
content of the most recent financial statements drafted by the Group, placing emphasis on the new activities, events and
circumstances that arose during the first quarter and not duplicating the information previously published in the
consolidated financial statements for 2020. Therefore, the intermediate abridged financial statements at 31 March 2021 do
not include all the information that would be required by complete consolidated financial statements prepared according
to the IFRS Standards adopted by the European Union, so that for a full understanding of the information included in these
abridged interim consolidated financial statements, they should be read together with the Group's consolidated annual
accounts for 2020.

The consolidated results and the calculation of the consolidated equity are subject to the accounting principles and policies,
measurement criteria and estimates followed by the Parent Company's Directors for the preparation of the abridged interim
consolidated financial statements. The main accounting principles and policies and measurement criteria correspond to
those applied to the consolidated annual accounts for 2020, except for the standards and interpretations which came into
force in the first quarter of 2021 (see section a).

All information corresponding to the three-month period ended 31 March 2020 within the explanatory notes to the abridged
interim financial statements for the three-month period ended 3 I March 2021 is only and exclusively presented for
comparative purposes.

**_a)_** **_Standards and interpretations effective in this period_**

During the three-month period ending 31 March 2021 new accounting standards came into force and were therefore taken
into account when preparing the interim consolidated financial statements:

(I) The approval status of the standards can be consulted on the EFRAG website.

**Impact of amendment to** **IFRS** **16**

An amendment to IFRS 16 was approved by the IASB on 28 May 2020 to help accounting for changes in leases resulting from
the pandemic caused by COVID-19. In March 2021, the IASB approved an amendment that extends the application period of
the aforementioned practical option ofIFRS 16 "Leases" by one year. At the date of these financial statements, this amendment
has not been adopted by the European Union.

In this sense, the new wording extends the term that may be affected by the income reductions that could qualify for the
exemption, putting back the deadline from 30 June 2021 to 30 June 2022. Had approval by the European Union occurred under
the terms defined by the IASB at 31 March 2021, the Group would have had no significant impact on its financial statements.

The amendments approved by the IASB are expected to be approved by the European Union before the end of 2021.

**_b)_** **_Comparative information_**

The infonnation contained in these abridged interim consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 2020 and for
financial year 2020 is presented solely for the purposes of comparison with the information for the three-month period
ended 31 March 2021 for the consolidated comprehensive income statement, the abridged consolidated statement of
changes in equity and the abridged consolidated cash flow statement.

_c)_ **_Seasonality of the Group's transactions_**

Given the activities of the Group's companies, its transactions have a slight cyclical or seasonal nature; historically the
months with the highest hotel sales are from March to June and from September to November. On the other hand, the
seasonality in the holiday hotels varies in the months of December to April and July to August, when sales are higher. This
seasonal distribution of income has been affected since mid-March 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**_d)_** **_Accounting correction_**

There have been no corrections of errors in the abridged interim consolidated financial statements for the three-month
period ended 31 March 2021 .

**_e)_** **_Change in accounting criteria_**

There have been no accounting criteria changes in the abridged interim consolidated financial statements for the three-
month period ended 31 March 2021.


-----

**_j)_** **_Responsibility for the information, estimates made and sources of uncertainty_**

The Directors of the Parent Company are responsible for the information contained in these abridged interim consolidated
financial statements.

Estimates made by the management of the Group and of the consolidated entities have been used in preparing the Group's
abridged interim consolidated financial statements to quantify some of the assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and
undertakings recognised. These estimates essentially refer to:

The assessment of possible impairment losses on certain assets.
The hypotheses used in the actuarial calculation of liabilities for pensions and other undertakings made to the
workforce.
The useful life of the tangible and intangible assets.
The valuation of consolidation goodwill.
The market value of specific assets.
Calculation of provisions and evaluation of contingencies.
The recoverability of capitalised tax credits.

Given the uncertainty in the economic environment caused by Covid-19, the Group has analysed the estimates made to
date where there was an indication of impairment and modified those it deemed relevant.

In spite of the fact that these estimates were carried out using the best information available at 31 March 2021 on events
analysed, it is possible that events may take place in the future which compel their amendment (upwards or downwards)
in years to come. This will be done in accordance with the provisions ofIAS 8, prospectively.

**_g) Consolidated cashjlow statements_**

In the consolidated cash flow statements, the following expressions are used with the following meanings:

                - Cash flows are the inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents.

                - Operating activities are the activities that form the main source of ordinary income for the Group, as well as other
activities that cannot be classified as investment or financing.

                - Investment activities are the purchase and disposal of long-term assets, as well as other investments not included in
cash and cash equivalents.

                - Financing activities are those activities that bring about changes in the size and composition of own funds and the
loans taken out by the Group.

For the purposes of preparing the abridged consolidated cash flow statement, "cash and cash equivalents" was considered
to be cash and bank deposits payable on demand, in addition to those highly-liquid short-term investments that are readily
convertible into specific cash amounts and subject to little risk of a change in value.

**_h)_** **_Contingent assets and liabilities_**

Note 24 of the report on the Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020 provides
information on the contingent assets and liabilities as at that date. Note 13 to these abridged interim consolidated financial
statements for the three-month period ended 3 I March 202 I details the most significant changes in the contingent assets
and liabilities during that period.

_i)_ **_Going concern_**

As a result of applying the new accounting standard IFRS 16, the Group has recognised a short-term liability corresponding
to the current value of the lease payment commitments to be made in the next twelve months that, at 31 March 2021,
amounted to 219,694 thousand euros (250,619 thousand euros at December 2020) meaning that, at 31 March 2021, current
liabilities are 180,671 thousand euros higher than current assets (84,279 thousand euros at December 2020). Given that


-----

the effect is caused by a purely accounting (non-financial) approach, this does not prevent the business's normal
development.

As a consequence of the situation caused by Covid-19, government measures taken worldwide to mitigate the spread of
the pandemic have had a significant impact on the Group. These measures resulted in the temporary closure of
establishments in the majority of its locations for a period of time, as well as significant falls in the business's operations
and the uncertainties associated with how the situation evolves. These abridged interim consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with the going concern principle as the Group has implemented crisis management
organisational measures to ensure business continuity, both individually (management of contagion or isolation situations),
and collectively.

These measures include actions focused on the temporary downsizing of existing resources as well as renegotiating lease
contracts and other actions focused on minimising the impacts of the situation.

Likewise, to strengthen the Group's liquidity in 2020, various medium- and long-term financing operations have been
signed. Amongst these, a syndicated loan of 250,000 thousand euros in April 2020 over 3 years with a partial guarantee
from the Official Credit Institution (ICO) and the renegotiation of the syndicated credit line for 236,000 thousand euros in
October 2020, whose maturity was extended until March 2023, stand out. Refinances of the finance lines were also signed,
which were previously short-term, extending their maturities to terms between 3 and 5 years, also within the framework
of ICO guarantees. Various bilateral loans were also formalised in different countries, the majority of which are also
partially guaranteed by the State. Moreover, negotiations were carried out with the loan institutions for the syndicated
credit line of 236,000 thousand euros and the syndicated loan of 250,000 thousand euros for the temporary waiver of
measuring financial ratios (covenants) until June 2021, thus ensuring the availability of both instruments (Note 10).

Additionally, the Group is working on an operation that includes a set of measures - part of which are already formalised
at the date of these interim financial statements - aimed at strengthening its capital structure and refinancing its main
financing sources that mature in 2023 so as to strengthen liquidity and provide the group with a stable financial position
with a maturity profile that allows it to address the challenges arising from recovering its activity from a solid platform,
by extending the maturity of the ICO financing until 2026 (Note 19), the waiver on compliance with financial ratios (Note
19), convertible unsecured subordinated loan by a subsidiary of the majority shareholder for 100 million euros (Note 19),
the analysis of available alternatives in financial markets to optimise and make all its corporate debt instruments more
flexible and possible asset sales through "sale and lease-back" operations.

Therefore, assuming a gradual reactivation of the business and scientific progress in relation to Covid-19 that facilitates a
gradual return to normality during 2021 and subsequent years, the Group considers it has sufficient resources to meet
future obligations in the next 12 months.

**_j)_** **_Significant changes in the composition of the Group and other sales of shareholdings_**

During the first quarter of 2021, there have been no significant changes in the composition of the Group and other sales or
shareholdings.

On 7 September 2020, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of the Bosco lo Hotels Group, which runs eight luxury hotels
in prime areas of Rome. Florence, Venice, Prague, Nice and Budapest. The Group operates through the following
companies:

Hungarian Opco New York Palace K.F.T.
Italian OpCo Roco Hospitality Group, S.R.L.
Czech Opco AGAGA, s.r.o.

The hotels are run under the variable rent with a guaranteed minimum system.

opening new hotels. In Spain, the refurbishment of the NH Collection Madrid Abascal stand out; in Italy, the renovations
of the NH Trieste; in Central Europe, the opening of the NH Hannover; in Benelux, the refurbishment of the NHOW
Brussels Bloom hotel. Finally, in New York, refurbishment of the NH Collection New York Madison Avenue. The total
effect of all additions in the year was 5.7 million euros.

During 202 I there have been amortisations of 24.2 million euros. The other movements in the period are explained by
the effect of conversion differences, the application of IAS 29 and the derecognition of certain assets.

**_b)_** **_Impairment losses_**

In the first months of 2021, no losses were recognised on items of property, plant and equipment.

**_c)_** **_Commitments to purchase property, plant and equipment items_**

Firm purchase/investment undertakings by the NH Group amounted to 21.4 million euros at 31 March 2021. These
investments will be made between 2021 and 2022.

**_d)_** **_Insurance policy_**

The NH Group has taken out insurance policies to cover any possible risks to which the different elements of its tangible
fixed assets are subject, and to cover any possible claims that may be filed against it in the course of its activities. It is
understood that such policies sufficiently cover the risks to which the Group is exposed.

**5.** **Leases**

**_a)_** **_Movement in the period_**

The main movements in the three-month period ended 31 March 2021 mainly correspond to the closure of four hotels
under leases, as well as the extension of various contracts. During the first quarter of the year, the NH Palazzo Barocci
and NH Firenze Anglo American in Italy and NH Comella and NH Ciudad de Almeria in Spain were closed.

The movement in both right-of-use assets and leasing liabilities is mainly non-cash given that the asset is modified based
on the variations produced in the liability, either due to changes in the contract's payment structure or by the update in
accordance with revenues benchmarks.

During the first half of 2020, there were amortisations of 43 .8 million euros a financial expense of21 .7 million euros.

The other movements for the year are explained by the loss of contracts and the change in exchange rate.

**6.** **Goodwill**

The impairment testing policies applied by the Group to its intangible assets and to its goodwill in particular are described
in Notes 4.2, 4.4 and I I to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020.

The change in the goodwill of Hotel Royal, S.A. Boscolo Hotels and Others results from the exchange rate effect.

7. **Other intangible assets**

result of the improvements investment within the framework of the HC Collection Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky management
contract . There have also been additions in the year (0.6 million euros) resulting from investments made in digitisation

to the detailed information in the aforementioned consolidated annual accounts is detailed below:

As part of the contractual liability assumed by the NH Group in the 2013 hotel purchase contract, the buyers required the
Group to pay tax on capital transfers that, in tum, had been claimed by the Dutch Treasury. At 31 March 2021, the total
amount of this tax, plus the corresponding default interest, was 12.9 million euros. The NH Group and the purchasers
reached an agreement whereby the NH Group assumed control of the judicial procedure. On 25 March 2021, a judgment
issued by the Court of First Instance was received rejecting NH's claim, with which the Group does not agree, so a new
appeal will be filed before the second judicial instance. The directors, based on the opinion of external advisers, consider
that, in a second judicial instance, it is more likely that NH's position will prevail in the High Court. This update did not

**14.** **Long-Term Incentive Plan**

On 29 June 2017, the Company's General Shareholders Meeting approved a second long-term share-based incentive plan ("the

cycles.

The Plan will consist of the delivery of the Group's ordinary shares to the beneficiaries calculated as a percentage of the fixed
salary in accordance with their level of responsibility. The number of shares to be granted was subject to the degree of
fulfilment of the following objectives:

                  - TSR (total shareholder return) at the end of each of the Plan's cycles, comparing the performance ofNH Hotel Group,
S.A. shares with the STOXX® Europe 600 Travel & Leisure share index

                  - Revaluation of the Share

                  - Recurring Net Profit

                  - Recurring EBITDA

The beneficiaries must remain in the Group at the end of each cycle, notwithstanding the exceptions deemed appropriate, as
well as achieving the minimum thresholds for each of the objectives.

The Plan targeted approximately 100 beneficiaries.

The fall in net turnover was a result of the COVID-19 pandemic - from the middle of March 2020- due to demand in the
hotel sector decreasing drastically from lockdown and travel restrictions.

"Rentals and Other Services" includes the income from fees invoiced to hotels operated on a management basis and the services
provided by the NH Group to third parties.

**15.2 Personnel expenses**

This item in the abridged consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement is broken down as follows:

Contributions to pension plans and similar 2,318 2,496

Other social expenses 1,298 2 591

**54,400** **103,705**

The decrease in personnel costs can be explained by the contingency plans that the Group put in place to alleviate the fall in
business due to COVID-19. Mainly these consisted of temporary layoffs, due to force majeure or productive reasons, and
voluntary reductions in working days and wages. In February 2021, collective redundancies were announced in central services
and the business unit in Spain. At 31 March, 5.4 million euros has been provisioned for this collective redundancy process as
part of a global plan pursuant to local legislation.

The savings recorded in 2021, as a result of the subsidies or allowances received from Governments to offset the restrictive
measures taken, was approximately 8.8 million euros in aid mainly from Northern Europe.

During the first quarter of 2021, the decrease in the level of activity of the Group's hotel continued as a result of COVID-19.
At the start of the pandemic, the Group implemented a contingency plan that includes a severe reduction in fixed and variable
costs directly related to the activity level.

On the other hand, during 2021, the Group managed to reach agreements with the vast majority oflandlords, which has made
it possible to obtain rent concessions to significantly mitigate the impact of the pandemic. In this sense, as a result of applying
the IFRS 16 amendment published on 28 May 2020, the Group recorded savings of 9 million euros relating to rent concessions
achieved in the aforementioned negotiations carried out as a result of COVID-19. Likewise, the Group has agreed rent
reduction regarding lease agreements not subject to IFRS I 6 application, nor to the aforementioned amendment, amounting to
4 million euros.

Likewise, as a result of the subsidies or bonuses received by the Governments to offset the losses produced by the fixed income,
a saving of9 million euros has been recorded in leases

results of its consolidated financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance
with the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU) and
other provisions of the financial reporting framework applicable in Spain.

Other information refers exclusively to the consolidated management report for 2020, the preparation
of which is the responsibility of the parent company's directors, and which does not form an integral
part of the consolidated annual accounts.

Our audit opinion on the consolidated annual accounts does not cover the consolidated management
report. Our responsibility for the consolidated management report, in accordance with prevailing audit
legislation, consists of:

a) Solely verifying that the consolidated non-financial information statement and certain information
included in the Annual Corporate Governance Report, referred to in the Audit Act, have been
provided in the manner established in applicable legislation and, if not, disclosing this fact.

b) Assessing and reporting on the consistency of the other information included in the consolidated
management report with the consolidated annual accounts, based on our knowledge of the
Group obtained during the audit of the accounts, as well as evaluating and reporting on whether
the content and presentation of this part of the consolidated management report are consistent
with applicable legislation. If, based on the work carried out, we conclude that there are material
misstatements, we are required to disclose them.

NH Hotel Group, S.A. and subsidiaries

On the basis of the work performed, as described above, we have verified that the information
mentioned in paragraph a) is provided in the manner stipulated in applicable legislation and the other
information contained in the consolidated management report is consistent with that of the
consolidated annual accounts for 2020 and its content and presentation comply with applicable
legislation.

**Responsibility of the directors and the Audit and Control Committee in** **relation to the**
**consolidated annual accounts**

The directors of the parent company are responsible for the preparation of the accompanying
consolidated annual accounts such that they present fairly the Group's consolidated equity, financial
situation and results in accordance with IFRS-EU and other provisions of the financial reporting
framework applicable to the Group in Spain, and for the internal control which they consider necessary
to enable the preparation of annual accounts free from material misstatements, due to fraud or error

In the preparation of the consolidated annual accounts, the parent company's directors are
responsible for assessing the Group's capacity to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as
appropriate, any going concern-related issues and applying the going-concern accounting principle,
unless the directors intend to wind up the Group or discontinue its operations, or unless no other
realistic alternative exists.

The parent company's Audit and Control Committee is responsible for overseeing the preparation and
presentation of the consolidated annual accounts.

**Auditors' res_e_onsibilities in** **relation to the audit of the consolidated annual accounts**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated annual accounts
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditors' report containing our opinion.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with auditing standards prevailing in Spain will always detect material misstatement when
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material, if individually or in
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken
on the basis of the consolidated annual accounts.

As part of an audit in accordance with current legislation governing the audit practice in Spain, we
exercise our professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. Also:

                 - We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated annual accounts
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
The risk of not detecting material misstatement due to fraud is higher than in the case of a
material misstatement due to error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, deliberate
omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control.

                 - We obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not to express an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group's internal control.

                 - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.

### pwc

NH Hotel Group, S.A. and subsidiaries

                 - We conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw
attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated annual accounts or, if
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions
may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

                 - We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated annual
accounts, including the disclosures, and assess whether the consolidated annual accounts
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

                 - We obtain sufficient and adequate evidence in relation to the financial information of the
companies or the business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated
annual accounts. We are responsible for managing, overseeing and performing the audit of the
Group.

We communicate with the parent company's audit and control committee in relation to, among other
matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and the significant audit findings, as well as any
major internal control weakness that we identify in the course of our audit.

We also provide the parent company's audit and control committee with a statement to the effect that
we have complied with applicable ethical requirements, including those of independence, and we have
notified the audit and control committee of any issues that could reasonably pose a threat to our
independence and, if appropriate, the relevant safeguards.

Among the matters notified to the parent company's audit and control committee, we determine those
that have been of the greatest significance in the audit of the consolidated annual accounts for the
current period and which therefore are key audit matters.

We describe these matters in our audit report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure
about the matter.

###### Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

###### NH HOTEL GROUP, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR 2020


**1.-  ACTIVITY AND COMPOSITION OF THE PARENT COMPANY**

NH HOTEL GROUP, S.A. (hereinafter the Parent Company) was incorporated as a public limited company in
Spain on 23 December 1981 under the trade name “Material para Ferrocarriles y Construcciones, S.A.”, which
was subsequently changed to “Material y Construcciones, S.A.” (MACOSA) and later to “Corporación Arco,
S.A.”

In 1992, Corporación Arco, S.A. took over Corporación Financiera Reunida, S.A. (COFIR), while at the same
time adopting the trade name of the company taken over and amending its corporate purpose to the new activity
of the Parent Company, which focused on the management of its shareholding portfolio.

During 1998, Corporación Financiera Reunida, S.A. (COFIR) merged with Grupo Catalán, S.L. and its
subsidiaries and Gestión NH, S.A. through the absorption of these companies by the former. Subsequently,
Corporación Financiera Reunida, S.A. (COFIR) took over NH Hoteles, S.A., adopted its trade name and
broadened its corporate purpose to allow for the direct performance of hotel activities, activities in which it had
already been engaged indirectly through its subsidiaries.

Information on these mergers can be found in the financial statements of the years in which said transactions
took place.

The General Shareholders' Meeting of 21 June 2014 agreed to change the company's name from “NH Hoteles,
S.A.” to “NH Hotel Group, S.A.”

The Parent Company heads up a group of subsidiary companies which, together with NH Hotel Group, S,A.,
make up the NH Hotel Group (hereinafter, the “Group” - see Appendices I and II) which is dedicated to running
hotels, on its own, either owning or leasing the hotels, or via third parties, with management, offering a wide
range of functions from its corporate head office and regional offices.

On 11 June 2018, MHG Continental Holding (Singapore) Pte Ltd made a public offer to acquire 100% of the
shares making up NH Hotel Group, S.A.’s company capital, the result of which was that Minor International
Public Company Limited (“MINT”) acquired shares representing 94.13% of the share capital of NH Hotel
Group, S.A., via its wholly owned subsidiary, MHG Continental Holding (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.

At the end of the financial year, the Group was operating hotels in 29 countries, with 361 hotels and 55,371
rooms, of which around 72% are located in Spain, Germany, Italy and the Benelux countries.

NH Hotel Group, S.A. has its registered address at Calle Santa Engracia, 120 - 7th floor, Madrid, Spain.
Furthermore, the name of the Parent Company did not change in this financial year or in the previous one.

**Main changes in 2020 (COVID-19)**

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization raised to the status of global pandemic the public
health emergency caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus (commonly known as coronavirus, while COVID-19 denotes
the disease caused by the virus). The rapid spread of COVID-19, on an international scale, has triggered an
unprecedented healthcare, social and economic crisis that continues to evolve

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic during March in Europe and Latin America, the hotel demand
has drastically decreased due to lockdowns, travel restriction and social distance, which severely affected
mobility.

During blockade, isolation and intense lockdown months, from march to ending of May, circa 95% of our hotels
were closed and those which stayed open was for charitable purposes. As a result, second quarter was the most
affected with an extremely low demand level. The gradual opening of hotels was initiated ending of May and it
was done progressively based on demand recovery and focusing on optimise value for money. During June circa
60% of the portfolio was open, a 70% in July and circa 80% during ending of August and September.

The smooth reopening of the hotels since June, after the portfolio was closed in March due to the intense
lockdown, enabled the attraction of national customers during the third quarter. The reopening, in spite of the
low level of demand due to mobility restrictions, was possible because of the flexible cost structure.

In 2020 NH Hotel Group put “Feel Safe at NH” into place in all its hotels. This is a new plan, with measures
approved by experts, to face up to the health crisis caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The Company has
reviewed all its procedures and made nearly 700 adaptations to its operating standards to preserve the health and
safety of travellers and employees worldwide. Grouped into 10 main lines of action and backed by specialists in
different fields, the measures implemented cover the digitisation of hotel services, adapting sanitation processes,
including social distancing regulations in operations and the application of personal protective equipment,
among others. We also reached a collaboration agreement with SGS, the world leader in inspection, analysis and
certification, which allows us to follow up on the measurement and diagnostics protocol established to verify
that the Group's hotels are clean and safe environments.

As a result of the impact of the second wave of infections in Europe at end of the third quarter, apart from
delaying additional reopenings that had been planned for the last months of 2020, hotels were closed once again
and, at the end of December 2020, around 60% of the portfolio was open. The impact of the second wave and
the stricter restrictions on mobility during the last months of the year resulted in a lower level of business when
compared to the third quarter.

In spite of the low level of demand, its flexible operational and financial structure has enabled the Group to
overcome the major challenges in 2020. Although the challenges will continue in the first months of 2021, the
Group will benefit in the first stage of recovery from brand recognition, excellent locations and strong market
positioning, once recovery is spearheaded in Europe.

**_Contingency Plan_**

As a result of the exceptional circumstances occurred after the beginning of the pandemic (Covid-19), the Group
implemented a relevant contingency plan to adapt operations and guarantee business sustainability with the aim
at minimizing costs during the closure of the portfolio, preserving Group's liquidity to attend to operational
necessities and ensuring that the gradual reactivation of the hotel activity is carried out efficiently and under the
premise of maximum guarantees in terms of health and safety.

Due to lack of visibility on the business recovery speed following measures on cost control were implemented
and will continue being implemented to ensure operational cost minimizing and liquidity preservation:


-----

###### • Personnel (Note 26.3): The Group carried out adjustments, temporary lay-offs and reductions in hours
and wages in hotels and central offices caused by force majeure or production reasons.

   - Other operational expenses (Note 26.4): negotiation with suppliers to reduce costs, search for
alternative supplies and achieve improvements on payment terms. Additionally, actions were
undertaken as: personnel travel suspension, significant reduction of marketing and advertisement
expenses despite the necessity of income incentives.

   - Leases (Nota 8): temporary reduction of fixed rents through renegotiation with landlords.

   - Investments: Main part of the investments were cancelled or postponed except for those in a very
advanced stage.

   - Liquidity reinforcement:

– Withdraw of the dividend proposal against 2019 results of 0,15 euros per share which could

have resulted an estimated payment of 59 million euros (Note 3).

– 275 million euros on credit lines drawn on March (Note 18).

– The Group entered into a syndicated loan for 250 million euros over 3 years, with no

repayments until maturity, endorsed by the "Instituto de Crédito Oficial" (ICO), in Spain (Note
18).

– In October 2020, the Group agreed the extension of the maturity of the syndicated credit

facility to March 2023, which original maturity was September 2021, with a limit of 236 million
euros (Note 18).

– Moreover, and additional to the waiver obtained in June 2020 for compliance with the

financial covenants included in the syndicated credit line for the months of June and December
2020, unanimous approval from the loan institutions was obtained to extend the waiver until June
2021. This waiver until June 2021 also extends to the syndicated loan (Note 18).

For more information about contingency plan see "Covid-19 impact and the measures implemented ” section of
the consolidated management report ended on 31 December, 2020.

The consolidated annual accounts include the impacts derived from the situation described above with special
relevance in the impairment analysis carried out by the group in the year and the resulting losses recorded (Note
11), the activation of tax credits based on the recovery of the themselves (Note 19), and the description and
analysis carried out by the administrators and their conclusion regarding the continuity of the business and the
corresponding formulation of the accounts as a going concern (Note 2.8).

The consolidated annual accounts must be read considering said evaluation and breakdown.

showing a true image of NH Hotel Group, S.A. and its subsidiaries’ consolidated equity and consolidated
financial position at 31 December 2020, and the consolidated financial performance, consolidated cash flows
and consolidated changes in equity for the financial year ended on that date.

The Group adopted the IFRS-EU on 1 January 2004 and, on that date, applied IFRS 1 “First-time adoption of
International Financial Reporting Standards”.

The Directors of the Parent company consider that the consolidated annual accounts for the 2020 financial year,
which were drawn up on 24 February 2021, will be approved by the General Shareholders Meeting without
amendment. The consolidated financial statements for 2019 were approved by the shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting held on 16 July 2020 and filed with the Companies Registry of Madrid.

Since the accounting standards and valuation criteria applied in the preparation of the Group's consolidated
financial statements may differ from those used by some of its component companies, the necessary adjustments
and reclassifications have been made to standardise them and adapt them to the IFRS adopted by the European
Union.

**2.2** **Standards and interpretations effective in this period**

During the year, new accounting standards came into force and were therefore taken into account when
preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements, but which did not give rise to a change in the
Group’s accounting policies:

**(1) New obligatory regulations, amendments and interpretations for the year commencing 01**

These regulations and amendments have been applied to these consolidated financial statements with no
significant impacts on either the reported figures or the presentation and breakdown of the information, except
for the application of the amendment to IFRS 16. See breakdown of impacts in the following section.

**(2) Transition and amendment IFRS 16.**

On 1 January 2019, the Group began to apply IFRS 16 to all contracts that were identified as leases in
accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4, except for the exceptions recognised by the standard.

The Group decided to apply the modified retrospective method as the transition method to IFRS 16, calculating
the asset at the commencement date of each identified contract and the liability at the transition date, using for
the calculation of both the incremental interest rate at the transition date and recognising the difference between
the two items as an adjustment to the opening balance of the consolidated reserves.

The impact of IFRS 16 on the Group's financial statements is significant due to the lease contract portfolio.

This impact at 1 January 2019 was mainly greater right-of-use net assets for 1.747 billion euros, a greater
liability for operating leases of 2.099 billion euros (1.839 billion euros of non-current liabilities and 260 million
euros of current liabilities), lower early payments assets of 3 million euros, lower lease linearisation assets of 16
million euros (13 million euros in non-current assets, 3 million euros in current assets), lower lease linearisation
liabilities of 19 million euros (17 million euros in other non-current liabilities, 2 million euros in other current
liabilities), greater deferred tax assets of 88 million euros and lower equity of 256 million euros. It also entailed
the reclassification of certain balance sheet items that were associated with lease contracts under the Right-ofuse assets heading. Specifically, a liability for risk provisions and expenses on onerous contracts of 7 million
euros, a liability for grants of 22 million euros and net intangible assets of 22 million euros.

The calculation of these impacts has been performed as if IFRS 16 had been applied from the inception of each
contract or from the date of initial consolidation of the lessee of the contract. The calculation was made by


-----

discounting the lease flows by recalculating the asset and liability for each material modification to the lease and
using an incremental interest rate calculated for each of the contracts at the transition date without taking into
account the tax effect.

On the other hand, an amendment to IFRS 16 was approved by the IASB on 28 May 2020 to help accounting for
changes in leases resulting from the pandemic caused by Covid-19. The amendment establishes an exemption in
which rental concessions caused by Covid-19 may not be recorded as amendments to the lease. This practical
solution is applicable if certain conditions are fulfilled:

###### • The change in payments for leases give rise to the revision of the consideration for the lease, which is
substantially the same as, or less than, the consideration for the lease immediately prior to the change;

###### • any reduction in payments for leases only affects the payments originally due on, or before, 30 June
2021 (for example, a rent reduction would comply with this condition if it gives rise to a reduction in
payments for leases on, or before, 30 June 2021, and an increase in payments for leases extending
beyond 30 June 2021); and

###### • there is no substantial change in the other terms and conditions of the lease.

Therefore, the standard provides that the Group can, if the above requirements are met, choose to account for the
contractual changes, not by recalculation of the rent but instead account for it as a change that is not considered
to be an amendment by IFRS 16.

The Group has chosen to use the practical solution, by which rental concessions that comply with that set out
above have generated less expenditure on rent of 46,195 thousand euros (Note 26.4).

**(3) New regulations, amendments and interpretations which will be mandatory in the years following**
**the year commencing 01 January 2020**

The following standards and interpretations had been published by the IASB on the date the consolidated
financial statements were drawn up but had not yet entered into force, either because the date of their entry into
force was subsequent to the date of these consolidated financial statements or because they had not yet been
adopted by the European Union:

**2.3** **Accounting correction**

During the first quarter of 2019, a situation was detected in the Consolidated Annual Accounts at 31 December
2018 in relation to the accounting for hyperinflation in the Argentine subsidiaries of the Parent Company in
accordance with IAS 29.

This situation corresponded to the recording of a higher consolidated result in 2018 derived from hyperinflation
in Argentine subsidiaries, when a net amount of 19 million euros before minority interests should have been
recorded directly in reserves. This therefore supposes a reclassification between the result and equity without
there being any additional impact to consider.

Following a report from the Audit and Control Committee, the Board of Directors considered that the situation
revealed did not represent a very significant impact on the Consolidated Annual Accounts at 31 December 2018
in the context of Article 38 of the Commercial Code as it did not affect the financial or equity position of the
Company, and did not justify, therefore, the consolidated annual accounts be restated.

Based on the foregoing, the aforementioned reclassification was recorded in equity at 31 December 2018, which
resulted in higher consolidated reserves of 16,212 thousand euros and a lower consolidated result for the same
amount. On the other hand, the effect of the reclassification on minority interests was 3,177 thousand euros as
higher reserves and the same amount as lower gain/(loss) and supposed a zero effect on this heading of the
abridged consolidated statement of changes in net equity.


-----

**2.4** **Accounting criteria change**

In 2020 there were no significant changes in accounting criteria.

**2.5** **Comparison of information**

As required by IAS 1, the information on 2019 contained in this consolidated annual report is presented for
solely comparative purposes with the information on 2020 and consequently does not in itself constitute the
Group’s consolidated financial statements for 2019.

In March 2020, the IFRS Interpretations Committee decided on the presentation of the effects on restatement for
hyperinflation and the translation into "Other Comprehensive Income" on a net basis where the entity considers
that the combination of the two effects meet the definition of exchange rate differences in IAS 21. If this is not
the case, the effect of hyperinflation (IAS 29) in equity and the effect of conversion differences (IAS 21) in
"Other Comprehensive Income" will be recognised separately. It is not allowable to present both variables net in
equity (an aspect that until now was accepted by the CNMV and ESMA). Following this approval, the Group
has reclassified the net effect of the restatement due to hyperinflation and the translation into "Other
Comprehensive Income", this reclassification has resulted in greater equity and a greater conversion differences
value of 77,711 thousand euros at 31 December 2018 and 1,151 thousand euros in 2019. This restatement has
had no impact on the Group's Equity.

**2.6** **Foreign currency transactions and balances**

**2.6.1 Working currency and presentation currency**

The consolidated annual accounts are presented in thousands of euros, rounded to the nearest thousand, which is
the Parent company’s working and presentation currency.

**2.6.2 Foreign currency transactions, balances and cash flows**

Transactions in foreign currencies are converted to the working currency using the exchange rates for the
working currency and the foreign currency on the dates on which the transactions are carried out.

Cash assets and liabilities in foreign currencies have been converted into euros using the rate at the end of the
financial year, while non-cash valued at historic cost are converted using the exchange rates applicable on the
date the transaction took place. The conversion to euros of non-cash assets which are valued at fair value has
been carried out using the exchange rate on the date when they were quantified.

In the presentation of the consolidated cash flow statements, the flows from transactions in foreign currencies
were converted to euros using the exchange rates on the date they occurred. The effect of exchange rate change
on cash and other cash equivalents in foreign currency is presented separately in the cash flow statement as “The
effect of exchange rate differences on cash”.

The differences appearing in settling transactions in foreign currency and the conversion of foreign currency
cash assets and liabilities to euros is recognised in profit and loss. Nevertheless, exchange rate differences
occurring in cash entries forming a part of the net business investment abroad are recorded as conversion
differences in other global profit and loss.

Losses or gains from exchange rate differences relating to foreign currency cash financial assets or liabilities are
also recognised in profit and loss.


-----

**2.6.3 Conversion of business abroad**

The following criteria have been different applied for converting into euros the different items of the
consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement of foreign companies
included within the scope of consolidation:

   - Assets and liabilities have been converted by applying the effective exchange rate prevailing at yearend.

   - Equity has been converted by applying the historical exchange rate. The historical exchange rate
existing at 31 December 2003 of any companies included within the scope of consolidation prior to the
transitional date has been considered as the historical exchange rate.

   - The consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement was translated at the average exchange rate
for the year, except for the companies in Argentina whose economy was declared hyperinflationary and
therefore, in accordance with IAS 29, their consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement was
translated at the year-end exchange rate.

Any difference resulting from the application these criteria have been included in the “Translation differences”
item under the “Equity” heading.

Any adjustments arising from the application of IFRS at the time of acquisition of a foreign company with
regard to market value and goodwill are considered as assets and liabilities of such company and are therefore
converted using the exchange rate prevailing at year-end.

**2.6.4 Foreign operations in hyper-inflationary economies**

In 2018, Argentina was declared a hyperinflationary economy due, among other causes, to the fact that the
accumulated inflation rate of its economy exceeded 100% over a continuous period of three years.

As a result, the Group began to apply IAS 29 to the financial statements of Argentine companies with
retroactive effect from 1 January 2018. Applying the standard involves the following exceptions:

   - Adjusting the historical cost of non-monetary assets and liabilities and the different equity items from
the acquisition date or inclusion on the consolidated balance sheet until year-end to reflect the changes
in currency’s purchasing power resulting from the inflation.

   - Reflecting the loss or gain corresponding to the impact of inflation for the year on the net monetary
position in the profit and loss account.

   - Adjusting the various items of the profit and loss account and the cash flow statement for the
inflationary index since its generation, with a counterpart in financial results and in a reconciliation
item on the cash flow statement, respectively.

   - Converting all components of the financial statements of Argentine companies at the closing exchange
rate; the exchange rate at 31 December 2020 was 102.88 pesos per euro (67.2 pesos per euro at 31
December 2019).

**2.7** **Responsibility for the information, estimates made and sources of uncertainty**

The Directors of the Parent Company are responsible for the information contained in these consolidated
financial statements.


-----

Estimates made by the management of the Group and of the consolidated entities have been used in preparing
the Group’s consolidated financial statements to quantify some of the assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and
undertakings recognised. These estimates essentially refer to:

###### – The assessment of possible impairment losses on certain assets. – The hypotheses used in the actuarial calculation of liabilities for pensions and other undertakings made
to the workforce;
###### – The useful life of the tangible and intangible assets. – The valuation of consolidation goodwill. – The market value of specific assets. – Calculation of provisions and evaluation of contingencies. – The recoverability of capitalised tax credits.

Given the uncertainty in the economic environment caused by Covid-19, the Group has analysed the estimates
made to date where there was an indication of impairment and modified those it deemed relevant.

In spite of the fact that these estimates were carried out using the best information available at 31 December
2020 on events analysed, it is possible that events may take place in the future which compel their amendment
(upwards or downwards) in years to come. This will be done in accordance with the provisions of IAS 8,
prospectively.

**2.8** **Going concern**

As a result of applying the new accounting standard IFRS 16, the Group has recognised a short-term liability
corresponding to the current value of the lease payment commitments to be made in the next twelve months that,
at 31 December 2020, amounted to 250,619 thousand euros (252,970 thousand euros at December 2019)
meaning that, at 31 December 2020, current liabilities are 84,279 thousand euros higher than current assets
(93,570 thousand euros at December 2019). Given that this effect is caused by a purely accounting (nonfinancial) approach, this does not prevent the business's normal development.

As a consequence of the situation caused by Covid-19, government measures taken worldwide to mitigate the
spread of the pandemic have had a significant impact on the Group. These measures resulted in the temporary
closure of establishments in the majority of its locations for a period of time, as well as significant falls in the
business's operations and the uncertainties associated with how the situation evolves. These consolidated annual
accounts have been prepared in accordance with the going concern principle as the Group has implemented
crisis management organisational measures to ensure business continuity, both individually (management of
contagion or isolation situations), and collectively.

These measures include actions focused on the temporary downsizing of existing resources as well as
renegotiating lease contracts and other actions focused on minimising the impacts of the situation.

Likewise, to strengthen the Group's liquidity, various medium- and long-term financing operations have been
signed. Amongst these, a syndicated loan of 250,000 thousand euros in April 2020 over 3 years with a partial
guarantee from the Official Credit Institution (ICO) and the renegotiation of the syndicated credit line for
236,000 thousand euros in October 2020, whose maturity was extended until March 2023, stand out. Refinances
of the finance lines were also signed, which were previously short-term, extending their maturities to terms
between 3 and 5 years, also within the framework of ICO guarantees. Various bilateral loans were also
formalised in different countries, the majority of which are also partially guaranteed by the State. Moreover,
negotiations were carried out with the loan institutions for the syndicated credit line of 236,000 thousand euros
and the syndicated loan of 250,000 thousand euros for the temporary waiver of measuring financial ratios
(covenants), ensuring, in this way, the availability of both instruments (Note 18).


-----

Therefore, assuming a gradual reactivation of the business and scientific progress in relation to Covid-19 that
facilitates a gradual return to normality during 2021 and subsequent years, the Group considers it has sufficient
resources to meet future obligations in the next 12 months.

**2.9** **Consolidation principles applied**

**2.9.1 Subsidiaries (Appendix I)**

Subsidiaries are considered as any company included within the scope of consolidation in which the Parent
Company directly or indirectly controls their management due to holding the majority of voting rights in the
governance and decision-making body, with the ability to exercise control. This ability is shown when the
Parent Company has the power to direct an investee entity’s financial and operating policy in order to obtain
profits from its activities. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control is transferred to the group and they
cease to be consolidated from the date on which control ceases.

The purchase method of accounting is used by the group to account for business combinations.

The financial statements of subsidiaries are consolidated with those of the Parent Company by applying the full
consolidation method. Consequently, all significant balances and effects of any transactions taking place
between them have been eliminated in the consolidation process. If necessary, adjustments are made to the
financial statements of the subsidiaries to adapt the accounting policies used to those used by the Group.

Non-controlling interests on the subsidiaries’ profit and loss and equity are shown separately on the consolidated
profit and loss statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of
changes in equity and on the consolidated balance sheet, respectively.

The profit or loss of any subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the financial year are included in the
consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement from the effective date of acquisition or until to the
effective date of disposal, as appropriate.

**2.9.2 Business combinations**

The Group applied the exception contemplated in IFRS 1 "First-time adoption of International Financial
Reporting Standards", so that only business combinations carried out from 1 January 2004—the transition date
to IFRS-EU—have been recorded using the acquisition method. Acquisitions of entities prior to that date were
recorded in accordance with the previous GAAP, taking the necessary corrections and adjustments on the
transition date into account.

The Group has applied IFRS 3 "Business Combinations"—revised in 2008—to transactions carried out from 1
January 2010.

The acquisition date is the date on which the Group gains control of the acquired business.

The purchase method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of whether
equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The consideration transferred for the purchase of a subsidiary
includes:

###### • the fair value of the assets transferred
 • the liabilities incurred with the previous owners of the business acquired
 • the holdings in the equity issued by the group
 • the fair value of any asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration agreement, and
 • the fair value of any prior holding in the subsidiary's equity.


-----

The identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities and the contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination
are, with limited exceptions, initially valued at their fair value on the acquisition date. The group recognises any
non-controlling interest in the entity acquired on a basis of acquisition at fair value, or by the proportional part
of the non-controlling interest of the net identifiable assets of the entity acquired.

The costs relating to the acquisition are recognised as expenses when they are incurred.

The excess of:

###### • the consideration transferred
 • the amount of any non-controlling interest in the entity acquired, and
 • the fair value of any prior holding in the equity of the entity acquired on the acquisition date

over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If these amounts are less than
the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is directly recognised in
profit and loss as a bargain purchase.

When payment of any part of the consideration in cash is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are
discounted at their actual value on the exchange date. The discount rate used is the entity’s incremental
borrowing rate of interest, being the rate at which a similar loan may be obtained from an independent financier
under comparable terms and conditions.

The contingent consideration is classified as equity or a financial liability. The amounts classified as a financial
liability are subsequently revalued at fair value with the changes in fair value being recognised in profit and loss.

If the business combination is carried out in stages, the book value at the date of acquiring the previously held
equity holding is revalued at fair value on the acquisition date, and any gain or loss is recognised in profit and
loss.

**2.9.3** **Non-controlling interests**

Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries acquired after 1 January 2004 are recorded by the percentage holding at
the acquisition date at the fair value of the net identifiable assets. Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries
acquired prior to the transition date are recognised by the percentage holding in their equity on the date of first
consolidation.

Excess losses attributable to non-controlling interests prior to 1 January 2010 but not allotted to them as they
exceeded the total amount of the holding in the equity of the subsidiary, are recorded as a decrease in equity
attributable to the Parent Company shareholders, except in cases where the non-controlling interests have a
binding obligation to assume a part or all of the losses and they have the capacity to make the necessary
additional investment. Profit obtained in subsequent financial years is allotted to the equity attributable to Parent
Company shareholders until the total losses absorbed in previous accounting period relating to non-controlling
interests are recovered.

From 1 January 2010, profit and loss and each item on the other comprehensive results, are allotted to equity
attributable to the Parent Company shareholders and the non-controlling interests in proportion to the holding,
even if this involves a debtor balance for non-controlling interests. Agreements entered into between the Group
and the non-controlling interests are recognised as a separate transaction.


-----

**2.9.4 Associates (Appendix II)**

Associates are considered as any companies in which the Parent Company has the ability to exercise significant
influence, though it does not exercise either control or joint control. In general terms, it is assumed that
significant influence exists when the percentage stake (direct or indirect) held by the Group exceeds 20% of the
voting rights, as long as it does not exceed 50%.

Associates are valued using the equity method in the consolidated annual accounts.

The profit (loss) net of tax of the associate companies is included in the Group’s consolidated comprehensive
profit and loss statement, in the item "Profit (Loss) from entities valued through the equity method", according
to the percentage of the Group's stake.

If, as a result of the losses incurred by an associate company, its equity were negative, in the Group's
consolidated balance sheet it would be nil; unless there were an obligation on the part of the Group to support it
financially.

At each year-end, the existence of indicators of a potential impairment of the investment in the associate is
assessed in order to recognise the related impairment loss, where appropriate To determine the fair value of
investments in companies whose sole asset consists of property inventories, appraisals were obtained from the
same independent valuer that appraised the Group's inventories. In the case of the other companies, discounted
cash flow valuations were performed internally, similar to those described in Note 4.4.

**2.9.5 Changes in the scope of consolidation**

**Additions to the scope of consolidation**

On 7 September 2020, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of the Boscolo Hotels Group, which runs eight
luxury hotels in prime areas of Rome. Florence, Venice, Prague, Nice and Budapest (Note 6, Business
combinations).

It also created the company, NH Strandgade APS in Copenhagen and two companies in Italy, NH Italia Real
Estate, S.r.l. and NH Holding Srl. These companies are currently non trading but the objective is for them to
become hotel operators.

In October 2019, the Group formed the company Anantara The Marker Ltd to acquire the company GCS Hotel
Limited, operator of The Marker hotel in Dublin (Note 6, Business combinations).

**Disposals**

In December 2020 the Group sold 100% of its investment in the company Onroerend Goed Beheer
Maatschappij Bogardeind Geldrop B.V., owner of the NH Geldrop hotel in Holland. The sale involved a cash
entry of 6,359 thousand euros. The sale did not have a significant impact on the profit (loss) for the year.

On 1 July 2020 the Group sold 100% of its investment in the company Onroerend Goed Beheer Maatschappij
Mass Best B.V., owner of the NG Best hotel in Holland. The sale involved a cash entry of 3,262 thousand euros.
The sale did not have a significant impact on the profit (loss) for the year.

In January 2019, the Group sold the 49% shareholding it held in Beijing NH Grand China Hotel Management
Co, Ltd. This sale resulted in a cash inflow of 1.9 million euros and has not had a significant impact on profits
for the year.


-----

**Mergers and demergers**

To simplify the group's corporate structure, in April 2020 the Argentine company Latina de Gestión Hotelera,
S.A. absorbed Inmobiliaria y Financiera Aconcagua, S.A., Edificio Metro, S.A., Polis Corporación, S.A. and
Blacom, S.A. Latina de Gestión Hotelera also spun off its investment in the Chilean company Latina Chile, S.A.
to the new company Latina Holding S.A.U.

In December, on the other hand, Hoteles Royal, S.A. spun off the investments it had in Chile in the companies
Eurotels Chile, S.A., Inmobiliaria Royal, S.A., Royal Santiago Hotel, S.A. plus Rhinco Inc—the investment it
had in the United States—to the new company Inversiones Chilenas, S.A.

Hoteles Royal, S.A. also absorbed: Hoteles la Boheme LTDA, Hotel Hacienda Royal LTDA, Hotel Andino
Royal, S.A., Hotel Pavillon Royal LTDA, Sociedad operadora Urban Royal Calle 26, S.A.S., Sociedad
Operadora calle 100 Royal S.A.S, Hotel Pacifico Royal LTDA, Hotel Parque Royal S.A.S, Sociedad Hotelera
Calle 74 LTDA, Sociedad operadora Barranquilla Royal S.A.S, Sociedad Operadora Cartagena Royal SAS and
Hotel Medellin Royal LTDA, to simplify the group´s corporate structure in Colombia.

**3.-** **PROPOSED DISTRIBUTION OF PROFITS**

At the Ordinary General Shareholders’ Meeting, the Parent Company's directors will propose that the losses on
the results for the financial year ended on 31 December 2020 be applied to the "Previous years' losses" account
to be offset in future financial years.

Furthermore, on 25 February 2020, the Board of Directors agreed the following proposal for application of the
profit/loss (in thousands of Euros) for the financial year ended on 31 December 2019:

2019

To legal reserve 15,894
To voluntary reserves 84,275

To distribution of dividends 58,771
**Total** **158,940**

On 28 April 2020, in light of the Covid-19 situation, the Company's Board of Directors agreed to withdraw the
proposal that considered the distribution of a gross dividend of 0.15 euros per share. The Board Meeting also
decided that, on the call of the Shareholders' Meeting, it would prepare an alternative proposal adjusted to the
new situation, making the statement of the auditor to which Article 40 6 bis of Royal Decree-Law 8/2020 refers
available to shareholders. This was duly communicated as Privileged Information to the National Securities
Market Commission on 28 April 2020 and registration number 194.

In light of the foregoing, the General Shareholders' Meeting on 16 July 2020 approved, among other items, the
new proposal detailed below:

|Col1|2019|
|---|---|

**4.-** **VALUATION STANDARDS**

The main principles, accounting policies and valuation standards applied by the Group to draw up these
consolidated financial statements, which comply with IFRS in force on the date of the relevant financial
statements, have been the following:

**4.1** **Property, plant and equipment**

Tangible fixed assets are valued at their original cost. They are subsequently valued at their reduced cost
resulting from cumulative depreciation and, as appropriate, from any impairment losses they may have suffered.

Due to the transition to IFRS, the Group reappraised the value of some land to its market value on the basis of
appraisals made by an independent expert for a total amount of 217 million euros. The reappraised cost of such
land was considered as a cost attributed to the transition to the IFRS. The Group followed the criterion of not revaluing any of its tangible fixed assets at subsequent year-ends.

Enlargement, modernisation and improvement costs entailing an increase in productivity, capacity or efficiency
or a lengthening of the assets’ useful life are recognised as increases in the cost of such assets. Conservation and
maintenance costs are charged against the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement for the year in
which they are incurred.

Withdrawn assets and items, whether arising as a result of a modernisation process or due to any other cause, are
accounted for by derecognising the balances presented in the corresponding cost and accumulated depreciation
accounts.

The Group depreciates its property, plant and equipment following the straight line method, distributing the cost
of the assets over their estimated useful lives, in accordance with the following table:

Estimated years of useful life

Buildings 33-50

Plant and machinery 10-30

Other plant, fixtures and furniture 5-10

Other fixed assets 4-5

These items are depreciated based on their estimated useful life or the remaining term of the lease, if this is less
than the useful life.

The profit or loss resulting from the disposal or withdrawal of an asset is calculated as the difference between
the profit from the sale and the asset's book value, and is recognised in the consolidated comprehensive profit
and loss statement.

**4.2** **Goodwill**

Goodwill is determined from the criteria set out in the section on business combinations.

Goodwill is not amortised, but its impairment is checked annually or earlier if there are indications of a potential
loss in asset value. For these purposes, the goodwill resulting from the business combination is assigned to each
of the Group's cash-generating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies


-----

of the combination and have the criteria referred to in section 4.4 (impairment) applied. After initial recognition,
goodwill is valued at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

At the time of the disposal of a subsidiary or jointly controlled entity, the amount attributable to the goodwill is
included when determining the profits or losses arising from the disposal.

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of companies with a functional currency other than the euro is valued in the
functional currency of the acquired company, with the conversion to euros being made at the exchange rate
prevailing at the balance sheet date.

Internally generated goodwill is not recognised as an asset.

**4.3** **Other intangible assets**

Other intangible assets are considered to be any specifically identifiable non-monetary assets which have been
acquired from third parties or developed by the Group. Only those whose cost can be estimated in an objective
way and from which future economic profits are expected are recognised.

Other intangible assets are initially recognised at acquisition or production cost and are subsequently measured
at cost less, as appropriate, their accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses they have suffered.

Any assets deemed to contribute indefinitely to the generation of profits are considered to have an indefinite
useful life. The remaining intangible assets are considered have a “finite useful life”.

Other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised and are hence subjected to the
“impairment test” at least once a year (Note 4.4).

Other intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortised according to the straight-line method on the basis
of the estimated years of useful life of the asset in question.

The following are the main items recognised under the “Other intangible assets” heading:

i) Hotel operating rights: As a consequence of entering into the consolidation of Hoteles Royal, S.A., the
Group recognised operating rights of the hotel portfolio for 35 years within this concept. Furthermore,
in the 2020 financial year, with the entry of Boscolo Hotels into the scope of consolidation, operating
rights of the hotels where operation has commenced with this business combination were recognised
lasting 31 years.

ii) “Concessions, patents and trademarks” basically reflect the disbursements made by Gran Círculo de
Madrid, S.A. for the refurbishment and remodelling of the building where the Casino de Madrid is
located. The amortisation of such works is calculated on a straight-line basis by taking into account the
term of the concession for operating and managing the services provided in the building where the
Casino de Madrid is located, which finalises on 1 January 2037. Furthermore, this item includes the
brands of the Grupo Royal with a useful life of 20 years.

iii) “Computer applications” include the costs incurred by the Group Companies in the acquisition and
development of various computer software programmes acquired by the different consolidated
companies. The amortisation of software applications is performed using the straight-line method at a
rate of 20-25% per year.

iv) Other Rights: this item reflects the right of usufruct on Hotel NH Plaza de Armas in Seville, acquired in
1994, whose amortisation is recognised in the income statement over the 30-year term of the agreement
at a rate which increases by 4% each year.


-----

**4.4** **Impairment to non-financial assets subject to amortisation or depreciation**

The Group evaluates the possible existence of a loss of value each year that would oblige it to reduce the
carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets. A loss is deemed to exist when the recoverable value is
less than the carrying amount.

The recoverable amount is determined as the value in use, with the sole exception of some cases in which the
valuation of an independent third party was used as the recoverable amount. The value in use is calculated from
the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a discount rate after tax that reflects the current market valuation
with respect to the value of money and the specific risks associated with the asset, covering a five-year period
and a perpetual value, except in the case of leased hotels that correspond to the term of the lease, a perpetual
value therefore not being considered in the latter.

Moreover, and regardless of the existence of any indication of impairment, the Group, at least once a year,
checks potential impairment that may affect goodwill.

The recoverable value should be calculated for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash
entries which are, by and large, independent of those relating to other assets or groups of assets. If this is the
case, the recoverable value is calculated for the Cash-Generating Unit (CGU) it belongs to. As a general rule,
the Group has defined each of the hotels it operates as cash-generating units, according to the real management
of their operations.

If there are signs of impairment in a CGU that goodwill could not be allotted to goodwill, the Group checks, in
the first place, the impairment to the CGU, without including goodwill and recognises, as appropriate, the
impairment loss at the level of the CGU. Subsequently, the Group checks the impairment in the group of CGUs
to which goodwill was allotted and recognises, as appropriate, the impairment loss at the level of the groups of
CGUs.

In the case of Hoteles Royal, S.A., where the whole business of Grupo Royal was acquired and whose purchase
was effective in 2015, the cash-generating unit corresponds to the Group as a whole (Colombian, Chilean and
Ecuadorian market).

In 2020, with the acquisition of the Boscolo Hotels Group, goodwill was generated which was allotted to a
single cash generating group unit that relates to the entire Group.

The operating result for each CGU is obtained at the end of the year without taking non-recurring results (if any)
or financial results into account. Once the operating result is obtained for each CGU, the impairment test is
performed for those in which there are indications of impairment. Among others, the Group considers that a
CGU has indications of impairment if it meets the following conditions: it has negative operating results and its
business is stable (they have been open for 3 years).

As an exception, given the current economic situation as a result of the pandemic caused by Covid-19, analyses
have been carried out to determine if there is any impairment to the CGUs as a whole.

Losses due to impairment of the CGU initially, if appropriate, reduce the value of the goodwill allotted to it, and
subsequently to the CGU's other assets, pro rata depending on the book value of each one of the assets, with the
limit for each one of them of the greater of their fair value less the costs of disposal and its value in use.

On each closing date the Group assesses whether there are any indications that impairment losses recognised in
previous years no longer exist or may have decreased. Impairment losses relating to goodwill are not reversible.
Impairment losses on the remaining assets are only reversed if a change has occurred in the calculations used to
determine the asset’s recoverable value. Reversal of the impairment loss is recorded as a credited to profit and
loss.


-----

**4.5** **Leases**

At the beginning of a contract, the Group assesses whether it contains a lease. A contract is, of contains, a lease
if it gives the right to control the use of the asset identified during a period of time in exchange for a
consideration. Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and the corresponding liability on the date the leased
asset is available for use by the group.

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially valued based on their present value. Leasing liabilities
include the net present value of the following leasing payments:

###### • Fixed payments (including fixed payments in essence), less any lease incentive collectable.
 • Variable payments for leases that reply on an index or rate, initially valued according to the index or
rate on the start date.

###### • Amounts expected to be paid by the group for residual value guarantees.
 • The price to exercise a purchase option if the group is reasonably certain that it will exercise that
option.

###### • Penalty payments terminating the lease if the term of the lease reflects the group exercising that option.

In order to determine the term of the lease contracts, the Group has taken as non-cancellable the initial term of
each contract, taking the possible unilateral extensions at the option of the Group only in those cases in which it
has been reasonably considered certain that they will be exercised, and only the cancellation options whose
exercise has been reasonably considered certain have been taken into account.

The general determination of not including unilateral extension of contracts as a part of their term, is based on
the Group´s historical experience. The windows for renewal have historically been used as renegotiation
windows, unless the market situation was clearly favourable for the Group. Therefore, given that hotel rental
agreements are normally signed with a first term that is higher than a macroeconomic cycle (5 years), our
experience shows that is it highly probable that some unknown event may occur on the date the agreement is
signed, and which may significantly affect such judgment. The attacks in Europe, in Brussels or in Nice, serve
as an example, as does the actual pandemic, as they changed the economic paradigm and affected the
frameworks for negotiating rent. Furthermore, to determine the term for lease agreements, the term for
recovering the investments made in it are taken into account.

To determine lease terms, there are no penalties for not exercising the extensions mentioned above, nor have
early terminations with penalties been included.

Contracts may contain leasing and non-leasing components. The Group assigns the consideration in the contract
to the leasing and non-leasing components based on their relative independent prices. For real estate leases in
which the Group cannot separate the leasing and non-leasing components, it accounts for them as a single
leasing component.

Leasing payments are discounted using the implicit interest rate in the lease. If this rate cannot be easily
determined, which is generally the case for the group’s leases, the incremental interest rate is used. The
incremental interest rate is the interest rate that the lessee would incur at the commencement of the lease if it
borrowed, over a period of time, with similar guarantees and in a similar economic environment. The interest
was calculated as a combination of the following elements:

###### • CDS curve of the economic environment
 • Euribor Swap Rate Curve.
 • Synthetic NH CDS curve.

These elements were combined to obtain an interest rate curve for each contract based on its geo-economics
specificities and from which the calculation process consists of bringing each of the discounted flows to the


-----

present value at the interest rate corresponding to each maturity within said curve and calculating which single
equivalent rate would be used to discount said flows.

Potential future increases in variable payments for leases based on an index or rate are not included in leasing
liabilities until they take effect. When the adjustments to the leasing payments based on an index or rate take
effect, the leasing liability is assessed again and set against the asset for right of use.

Leasing payments are allocated between principal and financial cost. The financial cost is charged to profit/
(loss) during the leasing period in a manner that creates a periodic interest rate on the remaining balance of the
liability for each period.

Right-of-use assets are valued at cost that comprises the following:

###### • The initial valuation amount of the leasing liability.
 • Any leasing payment made on or before the state date, less any incentive to lease received.
 • Any initial indirect cost.
 • Restoration costs.
 • Incentives to lease received from the lessor.
 • Provision on onerous contracts.

In application of IFRS 16, all rent that does not come under the definition of fixed payments in substance and,
therefore, is outside the Group's maximum compulsory commitment, as they are not inevitable, is recorded as an
operational expense for the year.

Therefore, the Group records variable rent that is linked to exploitation of the underlying assets as an expense,
along with those arising from percentages of sales and other similar reference points. Moreover, all rent that, in
application of IFRS 16, are outside the Group's maximum compulsory commitment are recorded as an
operational expense for the year.

Variable rents that are not, in essence, fixed and the way in which they may involve a liability for the Group
would be that the flows arising from exploitation of the CGU are estimated to be negative and, therefore, the
Group would be obliged to record a provision for onerous contracts.

An amendment to IFRS 16 was approved by the IASB on 28 May 2020 to help accounting for changes in leases
resulting from the pandemic caused by Covid-19. The amendment establishes an exemption in which rental
concessions caused by Covid-19 may not be recorded as amendments to the lease (Note 2.2.2).

**4.6** **Financial instruments**

**_4.6.1_** **_Financial assets_**

Financial assets are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when they are acquired and initially recognised
at their fair value. The financial assets held by Group companies are classified as follows:

   - Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are those assets acquired by the companies with the
objective of obtaining the contractual flows and selling them; or those assets that do not consist exclusively
of the payment of the principal and interest and the management model is the sale of the same, in general
terms, practically all of the variation in the fair value of the Group's financial assets are recorded with a
charge to the consolidated statement of changes in equity. Interest income, exchange rate differences and
impairment losses are recognised in the income statement and other gains or losses are recognised in
"Other comprehensive profit and loss" in equity. Any cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is
reclassified to profit or loss at the time of derecognition.


-----

   - Financial assets at amortised cost: assets whose contractual cash flows consist exclusively of principal
and interest payments and, if the management model of such assets is to hold them to obtain the contractual
flows. In this case, the Group records any changes in value with a charge to the consolidated
comprehensive profit and loss statement.

Transaction costs at the time of acquisition are recognised as an increase in acquisition cost or as an expense,
depending on whether the financial asset being transacted is considered at fair value through profit or loss.

Fair value of a financial instrument on a given date is construed as the amount for which it could be bought or
sold on that same date by two knowledgeable parties acting freely and prudently under conditions of mutual
independence.

Interest accrued on financial assets at amortised cost is recognised in the consolidated comprehensive profit and
loss statement on the basis of the effective interest rate. Amortised cost is construed as the initial cost minus any
collections or amortisation of the principal, taking into account any potential reductions based on expected loss.

As regards valuation corrections made to trade and other accounts receivable in particular, the criterion used by
the Group to calculate the corresponding valuation corrections, if any, generally consists of provisioning
according to the expected loss based on the credit risk of the customer portfolio.

The Group derecognises financial assets when the cash flow rights of the corresponding financial asset have
expired or have been transferred and the risks and rewards incidental to its ownership have been substantially all
transferred.

Conversely, the Group does not derecognise financial assets and recognises a financial liability for an amount
equal to the consideration received in the transfers of financial assets in which the risks and rewards inherent in
its ownership are substantially all retained.

**Trade debtors and other receivables**

Accounts receivable arising from trading operations are initially recorded at their transaction price and,
subsequently, a value correction is made for expected credit losses. Expected credit losses—due to the
fragmentation of the Group's trade debtors—are estimated taking the history of losses due to non-payment with
respect to the Group's sales and open items into account. For the value correction, in the current situation of
uncertainty caused by Covid-19, a detailed analysis is being carried out. To do so, all entries considered to be at
risk are being monitored and plans for collecting their payment are being made, or provisions being made for
those considered to be at risk of recovery.

Furthermore, the group’s credit risk tools are being used, with a default insurance policy for the clients included
in the policy, and for which, in the event of there not being certainty about payment, the requirements of the
policy to claim the amounts as an “incident” are being followed.

**_4.6.2_** **_Cash and cash equivalents_**

“Cash and Cash Equivalents” in the consolidated balance sheet includes cash, demand deposits and other shortterm, highly liquid investments that can be realised in cash quickly and are not subject to a risk of changes in
value.

**_4.6.3_** **_Financial liabilities_**

**Issues of bonds and other securities**

Debt issues are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, less the costs directly
attributable to the transaction. They are subsequently valued at their amortised cost using the effective interest


-----

rate method. Bonds with a maturity date greater than twelve months are classified under non-current liabilities,
while those with a maturity date of less than twelve months are included in current liabilities.

In the case of renegotiations, if they were considered non-substantial and consequently did not require the derecognition of the financial liabilities, the carrying amount of the amortised cost of those financial liabilities at
the date of renegotiation is recalculated and a gain or loss due to changes in profit or loss is recognised.

Convertible bond issues are recognised at the time of their issue, distributing the fair value of the consideration
received between their equity and liability components, assigning the residual value obtained after deducting the
amount established separately for the liability component, from the fair value of these instruments as a whole, to
the equity instrument. The value of any derivative embedded in the compound financial instrument other than
the equity component will be included in the liability component.

**Bank loans**

Loans received from banking institutions are recognised at the amount received, net of costs incurred in the
transaction. They are subsequently valued at amortised cost. These costs incurred in the transaction and the
financial expenses are recognised on an accrual basis in the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss
statement using the effective interest rate method, and their amount is added to liabilities to the extent to which
they are not settled in the period they were produced.

In the case of renegotiations, if they were considered non-substantial and consequently did not require the derecognition of the financial liabilities, the carrying amount of the amortised cost of those financial liabilities at
the date of renegotiation is recalculated and a gain or loss due to changes in profit or loss is recognised.

**Trade and other payables**

Trade accounts payable are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently valued at amortised cost using
the effective interest rate method.

**Derivatives and hedge accounting**

Derivatives used to hedge the risks to which the Group’s operations are exposed, mainly exchange and interest
rate risks, are valued at market value on the date they are contracted. Any subsequent changes in their market
value are recognised as follows:

###### – Concerning fair value hedges, the differences produced in both the hedging elements as well as in the
hedged elements (regarding the kind of risk hedged) are directly recognised in the consolidated
comprehensive profit and loss statement.

– For cash flow hedges, valuation differences in the effective part of the hedge elements are temporarily
recognised in the equity item “Equity valuation adjustments” and their adjustment is recognised as a lower
or higher cost in the initial recognition of the item.

Hedge accounting is interrupted when the hedging instrument expires or is sold or finalised or exercised, or
when it no longer meets the hedge accounting criteria. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss corresponding
to the hedging instrument that has been recognised in equity is kept there until the expected transaction is
undertaken.

When the transaction covered by the hedge is not expected to take place, the net cumulative gains or losses
recognised in equity are transferred to the profit or loss for the period. Any changes in the fair value of
derivatives which fail to meet hedge accounting criteria are recognised in the consolidated comprehensive profit
and loss statement as they arise.


-----

Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or in other main contracts are recognised separately as
derivatives only when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the main contract and
providing such main contracts are not valued at fair value with changes through consolidated comprehensive
profit and loss.

**Valuation techniques and assumptions applying to the measurement of fair value**

The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows:

###### • The fair value of financial assets and liabilities under standard terms and conditions which are traded in
active liquid markets are based on market prices.

   - The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities (excluding derivatives) is determined in
accordance with generally accepted valuation models on the basis of cash flow discounting using the
price of observable market transactions and contributor listings of similar instruments.

   - In order to determine the fair value of interest rate derivatives, cash flow discounting is used based on
the implicit flow determined by the interest rate curve according to market conditions. In order to
determine the fair value of options, the Group uses the Black-Scholes valuation model and its variants,
using for this purpose market volatilities for the strike and maturity prices of said options.

Any financial instruments valued after their initial recognition at fair value are classified as level 1 to 3 based on
the extent to which fair value can be observed:

###### • Level 1: includes any instruments indexed to listed prices (without adjustment) of identical assets or
liabilities in active markets.

   - Level 2: includes any instruments indexed to other observable inputs (which are not the listed prices
included under Level 1) for assets or liabilities, be it directly (i.e., prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived
from prices).

   - Level 3: includes any instruments indexed to valuation techniques, which include inputs for assets or
liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

**_4.6.4_** **_Equity instruments_**

An equity instrument represents a residual interest in the equity of the Parent Company once all its liabilities are
subtracted.

Equity instruments issued by the Parent Company are recognised in equity for the amount received, net of the
issue expenses.

**4.7** **Non-current assets and associated liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations**

Assets and liabilities the carrying amount of which is recovered through a sale and not from continued use are
classified as non-current assets held for sale and liabilities associated with non-current assets held for sale. This
condition is considered to be met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate
sale in its current state, and it is estimated that the sale will be completed within one year from the date of
classification.

Non-current assets and associated liabilities classified as held for sale are valued at the lower of their historic
cost or their fair value less selling expenses.

Discontinued operations represent components of the Group which will be disposed of. These components are
activities and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group, both operationally and for


-----

the purposes of financial reporting, and represent lines of business or geographical areas which can be
considered as separate from the rest.

**4.8** **Classification of financial assets and debts into current and non-current**

In the attached consolidated balance sheet, financial assets and debts are classified on the basis of their maturity;
in other words, those with a maturity date equivalent to or less than twelve months are classified as current and
those with a maturity date exceeding this are non-current.

**4.9** **Income and expenses**

Income and expenses are recognised on an accrual basis, i.e. when the control of goods and services they
represent has been transferred, irrespective of the moment when the monetary or financial flows deriving from
them arise.

More specifically, income is calculated at the fair value of the consideration to be received and represents the
amounts to be collected for the goods and services delivered within the ordinary framework of operations,
subtracting any discounts and taxes.

**Sale of rooms and other related services**

Income from the sale of rooms and other related services is recognised daily based on the services provided by
each hotel, including customers who are still staying at the hotel at the close of each day. In this respect, the
Group recognises the income when the service is considered to be provided and, therefore, fulfils the obligation
for performance assumed on check-in. Due to this, for example, in the case of an accommodation service that
covers several nights, the income is recognised on a daily basis for each one of the overnight stays.

The consideration received is distributed among the contracted services. These include direct services such as
room, food, drink and other consumption, and others related to banquets, events and the rental of spaces.
Therefore, the obligations are completely separate and they are recorded at the time they occur.

In the case of the sale of several services together, such as, for example, an accommodation service with one for
breakfast, the Group, when it makes the offer, sets the price for each one of the obligations assumed, for which
reason at the time the services is considered to be provided the income is recorded at the price set beforehand.
Solely in the case of promotions where the service is provided “free-of-charge” with the other one, the Group
applies a methodology where the consideration is divided using a ratio calculated by hotel based on the costs of
the service at that hotel plus an additional margin.

**Provision of services**

The Group recognizes the income from its hotel management contracts in the year in which the services are
provided, based on the evolution of the variables that determines this income and which are mainly the total
income and the gross operating profit of each hotel managed by the Group.

**Loyalty programme**

With regarding to the accounting treatment of the “NH Rewards” customer loyalty programme, we consider that
if awarding points gives a significant right to the customer, then it effectively pays the company for future goods
or services in advance, and the company should recognise the income from ordinary activities when the points
are redeemed or when they expire.

Therefore, when the significant right is generated, the Group records a provision for the estimated equivalent
value, partly lowering the income from the sale coupled with the issue of the right. When points are redeemed
the income from the transaction is recorded and the provision is derecognised.


-----

The estimated value of the significant right is calculated, showing the discount the customer would receive when
exercising the option (one Euro for each point the customer has collected) and taking the two following aspects
into account:

###### • any discount the customer may receive without exercising the option; and

   - the probability that the option will be exercised.

The amount of the provision relating to the loyalty programme is recorded in current liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheet.

**4.10** **Official subsidies**

Group companies follow the criteria set out below in recognising official subsidies:

– Non-reimbursable capital subsidies (connected with assets) are valued at the amount granted, recognised
as deferred income and taken into profit and loss in proportion to the depreciation of the assets financed
by such subsidies during the financial year.

– Operating subsidies are recorded as a reduction of the expenses they finance.

**4.11** **Corporate income tax**

The cost of the year’s corporation tax is calculated through the sum of the current tax resulting from applying
the tax rate to the taxable income for the year and then applying the relevant tax adjustments according to the
law plus any changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities include temporary differences, being any amounts expected to be payable or
recoverable due to differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities and their tax value, as
well as tax loss carry-forwards and any credits resulting from unapplied tax deductions. Said amounts are
recognised by applying to the relevant temporary difference or credit the tax rate at which they are expected to
be recovered or settled.

In some countries, the tax rate varies depending on whether a transfer of assets is made. In these cases, the
Group’s policy consists of applying the effective tax rate at which they are expected to be recovered or settled.
In the opinion of the Parent’s Directors, the deferred tax thus calculated covers the amount which may
eventually be settled, if any, in the foregoing case.

Deferred tax liabilities for all taxable temporary differences are recognised, except for those in which the
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill amortisation of which is not tax-deductible
or the initial recognition of other operating assets and liabilities which do not affect either the tax or accounting
result.

Deferred tax assets identified as temporary differences are recognised only if it is deemed probable that the
consolidated entities will make sufficient tax profits in the future to realise them and they do not come from the
initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which does not affect either the tax or
accounting result. Other deferred tax assets (tax loss carry-forwards and tax credits) are recognised only if it is
likely that the consolidated companies will make sufficient tax profits in the future to be able to apply them.

At each year-end, deferred taxes (both assets and liabilities) are reviewed in order to verify that they remain in
force and the relevant corrections are made in accordance with the outcome of the analyses conducted.


-----

**4.12** **Obligation to employees**

Spanish hotel companies are obliged to make a specific number of monthly salary payments to those employees
who leave the company due to retirement, permanent disability or upon reaching a certain age and having a
certain number of years of service and fulfilling certain pre-established requirements.

In this regard and in compliance with Royal Decree-Law 16/2005, the Group has outsourced its pension
obligations for its employees' pension plans.

Also, in accordance with Italian law, employees of Italian companies have the right to compensation if they
resign or are dismissed.

Its obligations to personnel also include those arising from contracting pension funds for certain employees,
which in the Group, mainly affects the business units of Italy and the Netherlands.

Therefore, to provide for these obligations to future payments to personnel, the Group has recognised a liability
under “Provisions for Risks and Charges” (Note 21).

**4.13** **Onerous contracts**

The Group considers onerous agreements to be those in which the inevitable costs of fulfilling the obligations
they entail exceed the economic benefits expected from them.

The Group follows the principle of recording a provision at the present value of the aforementioned differences
between the costs and benefits of the contract, or the compensation foreseen for abandonment of the contract, if
such is decided.

**4.14** **Share-based Remuneration Schemes**

These schemes, which are settled in shares, are valued at the time of granting, using a financial method based on
a binomial model which takes into consideration the strike price, volatility, the exercise period, the expected
dividends, the risk-free interest rate and the assumptions made concerning the financial year.

In accordance with IFRS 2, the above-mentioned valuation is recognised in profit or loss under personnel
expenses during the period established as a requirement for the employee to remain in the company before
exercising the option. Said value is recognised on a straight-line basis in the consolidated comprehensive profit
and loss statement from the date the option is granted until the date on which it is exercised.

On each subsequent closing date, the Group reviews the estimates regarding the number of options expected to
be exercisable, adjusting the equity figure if necessary.

**4.15** **Treasury shares**

Pursuant to IAS 32, treasury shares are presented by reducing the Group’s equity. Treasury shares are
recognised at the value of the consideration paid and are deducted directly from equity. Gains and losses on the
acquisition, sale, issue or retirement of treasury shares are recognised directly in equity and in no case are they
recognised in the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement.

**4.16** **Provisions and obligations to employees**

The Group follows the policy of provisioning for the estimated amounts arising from ongoing litigation,
indemnities or obligations, as well as for any sureties or guarantees granted by Group companies which could
involve the Group in a payment obligation (either legal or implicit), provided the amount can be reliably
estimated.


-----

Provisions are quantified based on the best information available on the position and evolution of the events that
cause them and are re-estimated at the end of each reporting period, being totally or partially reversed when
these obligations cease to exist or decrease.

Contingent liabilities, except in business combinations, are not recognised in the consolidated financial
statements, but are reported in the notes to the financial statements, in accordance with the requirements of IAS
37.

The consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2020 includes, pursuant to IFRS (IAS 37), a provision of 1,661
thousand euros for this item (841 thousand euros at 31 December 2019).

**4.17** **Environmental policy**

Investments arising from environmental activities are valued at their original cost and capitalised as increases in
the cost of fixed assets or inventory in the financial year in which they are incurred.

Any expenses arising from environmental protection and improvement are recognised in the consolidated
comprehensive profit and loss statements for the year in which they are incurred, irrespective of the moment
when the cash or financial flows deriving from them arise.

Provisions for likely or certain liabilities, ongoing litigation and outstanding indemnities or obligations of an
indeterminate amount connected with the environment and not covered by the insurance policies taken out are
established at the time the liability or obligation linked to the indemnities or payment arises.

**4.18** **Consolidated cash flow statements**

The following terms with their corresponding explanation are used in the consolidated cash flow statement
prepared using the indirect method:

###### – Cash flows: inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents, which are short-term, highly liquid
investments that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

– Operational activities: the typical activities of the entities forming the consolidated group, along with
other activities that cannot be classified as investing or financing activities.

– Investing activities: the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included
in cash and cash equivalents.

– Financing activities: activities that result in changes in the size and composition of the equity and
liabilities that are not operating activities.

**5.-** **PROFIT/(LOSS) PER SHARE**

Profit (Loss) per share is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to the Group in a period by the
weighted average number of shares in circulation during the period, excluding the average number of treasury
shares held during the same period.

In accordance with this:

Net Profit/(Loss) for the year (thousands of euros) (437.159) 89.964
Weighted average number of shares in circulation (in thousands) 391.965 391.754
**Basic Earnings per share (basic and diluted) in euros** **(1,115)** **0,230**

**6.** **BUSINESS COMBINATIONS**

On 7 September 2020, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of the Boscolo Hotels Group, which runs eight
luxury hotels in prime areas of Rome. Florence, Venice, Prague, Nice and Budapest. The Group operates
through the following companies:

###### • Hungarian Opco New York Palace K.F.T.

   - Italian OpCo Roco Hospitality Group, S.R.L.

   - Czech Opco AGAGA, s.r.o.

The hotels are run under the variable rent with a guaranteed minimum system.

The amount of the initial consideration for the acquisition of the Boscolo Hotels Group was 50,491 thousand
euros, to which 2,147 million euros was added relating to the net working capital position at the integration date.
Both amounts were wholly paid up at the time of acquisition. After a subsequent review of the net working
capital position and an additional agreement with the vendor, the Group recorded an account receivable with the
vendor of 6,900 thousand euros, recorded under the "Other non-trade debtors" heading.

The consideration, the final fair values of the assets and liabilities identified at the time of acquisition and the
final goodwill are set out below:

The inflow of Boscolo Hotels has involved a negative effect of 11.3 million euros on the consolidated
comprehensive income statements at 31 December 2020. The negative effect was mainly caused by the effects
of Covid-19.

In October 2019, the Group formed the company Anantara The Marker Ltd to acquire the company GCS Hotel
Limited, operator of The Marker hotel in Dublin. The acquisition cost was 13,652 thousand euros and the
inclusion of these companies has had the following effects on the consolidated balance sheet:

The main additions occurring during the 2020 financial year relate to hotel refurbishment and opening new
hotels. Of note is the refurbishment on the NH Sants Barcelona and NH Plaza de Armas in Spain, the
renovations of the NH Napoli Panorama, NH Palermo, NH Trieste, NHC Roma Vittorio Veneto and NH Milano
Touring in Italy, the refurbishment on the NH Heidelberg, NH Munchen Airport, NH Frankfurt Airport and NH
Salzburg City in Central Europe, the refurbishment on the NH Conference Center Leeuwenhorst NH
Amsterdam Caransa, NH Brussels Airport, NH Brussels Bloom and NH Luxembourg hotels in Benelux, and in
Latin America the refurbihments of NHC Monterrey San Pedro and NH Ciudad de Santiago hotels. Finally, in
New York, refurbishment of the NH New York Jolly Madison Towers.

The effect on the profit and loss account of assets de-recognised, replaced or disposed of to third parties outside
the Group was a loss of 1,668 thousand euros (a loss of 4,627 thousand euros in 2019), recognised under "Profit/
(loss) on the disposal of non-current assets" in the 2020 consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement.

The net entries for the year included in the “Business combination” and “Changes in the scope of consolidation”
rows come, on the one hand, from the sales of the companies Onroerend Goed Beheer Maatschappij Maas Best,
B.V., owner of the NH Best hotel, and Onroerend Goed Beheer Maatschappij Bogardeind Geldrop, B.V., owner
of the NH Geldrop hotel, both in Holland (Note 2.9.5), and the acquisition of the Boscolo Hotels Group comes
under business combinations (Note 6).

At 31 December 2020, there were tangible fixed asset elements with a net book value of 208 million euros (232
million euros in 2019) to guarantee several mortgage loans (Note 18).


-----

The Group has taken out insurance policies to cover any possible risks to which the different elements of its
tangible fixed assets are subject, and to cover any possible claims that may be filed against it in the course of its
activities. It is understood that such policies sufficiently cover the risks to which the Group is exposed.

At 31 December 2020, firm purchase undertakings amounted to 17.3 million euros. These investments will be
made between 2021 and 2022 (37.8 million euros in 2019).

The main recognitions for the year are due to the opening of several hotels on a lease basis. The openings of the
NHOW Amsterdam Rai in the Netherlands and the NH Collection Palazzo Verona in Italy were noteworthy.

Likewise, the change in the scope includes the acquisition of the Boscolo Hotels Group through the companies
Roco Hospitality Group S.R.L., New York Palace, Kft. and Agaga, S.R.O.; hotel leasing operators in Italy,
Hungary and the Czech Republic (Nota 6).

The main impacts on the statement on the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement related to the
application of IFRS 16 are a higher financial expense of 94,106 thousand euros (89,620 thousand euros in
2019), a net gain of the disposal of non-current assets of 624 thousand euros (positive net gain of 1,044
thousand euros in 2019), due mainly to cancellations of contracts that had no cash impact and asset impairment
of 4,333 thousand euros (impairment reversal of 2,175 thousand euros in 2019).

The amounts recorded as right-of-use assets correspond to properties where the NH Group is a lessee for its
operation as a hotel.

Short-term leases and low-value leases are recognised as an expense in the consolidated comprehensive profit
and loss account on a straight line basis. A short-term lease contract is one where the period is less than or equal
to 12 months. A “low value contract” is one whose underlying asset assigned in use would have a new value of
under 5 thousand euros. The impact recorded on the attached consolidated comprehensive profit and loss
statements for the leases totals an income of 31,374 thousand euros (Note 26.4). This income is a result of
applying the exemption introduced in IFRS 16 on 28 May 2020, which meant the Group recorded 46,195
thousand euros (Note 2.2).

Furthermore, in the lease agreements, there are no restrictions or imposed clauses and no sales transactions with
subsequent leasing were carried out during the financial year.

Future cash output that the lessee is potentially exposed to, and which are not shown in the valuation of leasing
liabilities, exclusively relate to payments for variable leasing.

Therefore, future gross payments estimated for the next 5 years total 391 million euros. Nevertheless, these
expenses will result in higher income and produce higher profits.

The Group has not granted any options to extend and terminate, or guarantees of residual value. There does exist
a lease that has not commenced, for which the Group has undertaken gross lease payments of 437 thousand
euros in a period of 2 to 5 years, and 6,833 thousand euros in a period of over 5 years.

**10.1 Hotel operating rights**

The most significant additions in this financial year occurred in London, as a result of opening a new hotel.

The net additions in the year in the column "Business combinations" come from the purchase of Boscolo Hotels
(Note 6, Business combinations).

**10.2 Software applications**

The most significant additions in this financial year were a result of investments made in digitisation and
improvement to the customer journey experience, and digitisation and optimisation of operating processes to
gain sustainability, mobility and include customer care.

**10.3 Other rights**

The main movement in 2019 corresponds to the classification of various assets related to lease contracts which,
at 1 January 2019, are considered as the higher value of the right-of-use assets in accordance with the
application of IFRS 16 (Note 8).

**11.-** **IMPAIRMENT**

The Group evaluates the possible existence of a loss of value each year that would oblige it to reduce the
carrying amounts of its assets. As a result of the crisis caused by the spread of Covid-19, impairment analysis
carried out by the Group in the financial year determined that losses be recognised for impairment losses.

**11.1 Key assumptions used to calculate value in use**

The value in use of each CGU is determined discounting its future cash flows. These are estimated based on the
result for the year and the records of at least five previous years. Given the uncertainty stemming from the
current economic environment, macroeconomic information from external information sources has been
analysed and with Group Management's business knowledge, different evolution and forecast possibilities have
been made on the most likely basis, taking the effect of the pandemic into account.

The evolution of the key assumptions in the analysed hotels has taking the business knowledge of Group
Management into account as well as the expected recovery of the sector after the Covid-19 pandemic. In this
regard, the assumed projections are based on the Management’s budget for 2021, which assumes a dramatic fall
in revenues compared to 2019 due to the negative effect that the Covid-19 pandemic has had on tourism, one of
the most affected sectors. It is estimated that the loss of business in 2020 will be recovered in the next three
years, beginning in the second half of 2021 once mobility restrictions are eased as vaccination progresses and
therefore consumer confidence recovers. The Group's strong positioning in the countries where it operates, the
good locations of the portfolio and the high recognition of its brands are key factors in the assumed recovery
period up to 2023 and 2024, when it is hoped to reach the figures of the period prior to the pandemic, which was
the 2019 financial year.

There are a number of factors that are considered by the Group's Management to make the projections, which
are:

   - Estimate of external sources specialising in the hotel sector, along with investment banks with
reference to the recovery of the hotel sector.

   - Estimate of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth issued by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
in its report published in October of each year for the next five years.

   - Knowledge of the business/asset/local situation of the local Management of each Business Unit to
which each CGU belongs.

   - Historical results obtained by the CGUs.


-----

   - Investments in repositioning the CGUs.

These factors are reflected in the cash flows through the following working hypotheses used to obtain the
projections:

   - Income from accommodation is projected as the product of percentage occupation, and average rate per
room (“ADR” Average Daily Rate: is the ratio of the total income from rooms in a specific period
divided by the rooms sold in that specific period) and the total rooms available per year.

   - The other revenues are projected based on the average of the relationship between the revenue from
accommodation and those revenues.

   - Staff costs are calculated based on the average staff costs with a growth in the inflation index (CPI).

   - Direct expenses are directly associated with each of the revenues and are projected on the basis of an
average ratio, while undistributed expenses are projected based on the average ratio between these and
direct expenses.

   - For its part, tax is calculated from the tax rates applicable in each country.

The discount rates were calculated by a third party using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
methodology: Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), as follows:

WACC=Ke*E/(E+D) + Kd*(1-T)*D/(E+D)
Where:
Ke: Cost of Equity
Kd: Cost of Financial Debt
E: Own Funds
D: Financial Debt
T: Tax Rate

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is used to estimate the cost of equity (ke).

The main variables used by a third party to calculate the discount rate are as follows:

###### • Risk-free rate: is obtained from the standard average profitability of state bonds in each country
including an adjustment for country risk and an inflation differential where appropriate.

   - Market risk premium: defined as 6.5% (6.8% in 2019), based on market reports.

   - Beta or systematic risk: Using a sample of listed companies whose businesses are comparable to our
business, the sector’s risk differential is estimated in relation to the average risk on the global market.
In addition, the adjusted average financial structure of the aforementioned sample of companies was
considered (63% Own Funds, 37% Debt) to calculate the re-leveraged beta coefficient, as well as the
relevant tax rate in each country.

   - Debt cost, estimated as an average differential over the Euribor at 12 months over 10 years, plus an
adjustment for inflation and country risk in countries with a currency other than the Euro.

Below are the pre-tax discount rates of the major countries::

Discount rate before taxes:
**Germany** **Netherlands** **Italy** **Spain** **Colombia**
2020 11,2% 9,6% 12,12% 10,6% 13,6%
2019 8,8% 7,4% 12,7% 9,3% 16,9%

##### I I

The evolution of the key assumptions in hotels with indications of impairment at 31 December 2020 in the
major countries in euros was as follows:

**2020** I **2019** **2020** I **2019** **2020** I **2019** **2020** I **2019** **2020** I
**Germany** **Netherlands** **Italy** **Spain** **Colombia**
Post-tax WACC 7,54% 5,47% 7,79% 6,01% 8,12% 8,21% 8,14% 6,88% 10,57%
Growth rate (g) 1,97% 2,13% 1,70% 2,01% 1,35% 1,50% 1,69% 1,77% 2,91%
Average ADR (years of projection) 100,8 107,7 59,5 61,5 133,5 136,7 92,5 97,4 62,1
Average Occupancy Rate (years of
65,0% 74,5% 54,3% 56,6% 65,1% 71,0% 66,2% 75,9% 61,5%
projection)

The after-tax discount rates used by the Group for these purposes range in Europe from 7.3% to 11.5% (5.5%
and 8.2% in 2019) and in Latin America from 10.6% to 16.2% (9.4% and 14.6% in 2019) without taking into
account Argentina, whose after-tax discount rate has been calculated taking into account its hyperinflationary
economic situation and varies between 44.6% in 2021 and 35.6% in 2025, based on the estimate of inflation. In
this regard, the cash flows resulting from the impairment tests were also calculated after tax. In addition, the
book value to which the value-in-use is compared does not include any deferred tax liabilities which could be
associated with the assets.

Using a post-tax discount rate and post-tax cash flows is consistent with paragraph 51 of IAS 36, which states
that "estimated future cash flows will reflect assumptions that are consistent with the manner of determining the
discount rate". In addition, the result of the post-tax flows updated at a post-tax discount rate would obtain
uniform results with respect to the impairment test if a pre-tax rate were used and, therefore, the impairment and
reversion accounting records would be uniform.

**11.2 Sensitivity analysis**

Furthermore, the Group has carried out a sensitivity analysis for each of the CGUs, and for the groups of CGUs
where goodwill is allotted. 3

For each scenario, each hypothesis has been considered individually, recording the impact on impairment for
each of them. Scenario 1 is a negative one where the discount rate is raised 100 b.p. above the rate used in the
test and a growth rate lower by 100 b.p., i.e. with minimum growth, and falls in occupancy and ADR of 1%
which would lead to additional impairment to that registered in 2020.

In scenario 2, it is a positive scenario where the discount rate is sensitized 100 bp below the rate used in the test,
a growth rate of 100 bp and with occupancy increases of 100 bp and an average ADR of 1%, which would lead
to having registered a lower deterioration than that registered in 2020.

A sensitivity analysis of the results of the impairment analysis given variations in the following scenarios,
including the impacts that the amendment of each scenario would have without affecting the rest, for the main
goodwill, is set out below:

**11.3 Impairment losses**

If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be lower than its carrying amount, the latter is reduced to
the recoverable amount by recognising the corresponding reduction through the consolidated comprehensive
profit and loss statement.

If an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the limit of the
original value at which such asset was recognised before the loss of value was recognised.

The Group recognised an impairment loss of 76,258 thousand euros (4.889 thousand euros in 2019), as it is
summarised below:

   - Property, plant and equipment: impairment amounting to 61,250 thousand euros was recognised in
2020 for certain tangible assets; this impairment mainly corresponds to real estate and is a result of the
worsening of future expectations of cash flows for different reasons, including the opening of
competitors' hotels or the loss of an important customer and the worsening of the outlook due to the
Covid-19 situation. (4,289 thousand euros in 2019). On the other hand, there was a reversal of 4,523
thousand euros resulting from the improvement in expectations, recorded under the heading "Gains/

(9,288 thousand euros in 2019).

   - Right of use: it has been registered an impairment of the Right of use amounting to 4,333 thousand
euros (reversal of 2,175 thousand euros 2020) (Note 8).

   - Goodwill: it has been registered an impairment amounting to 14,098 of the goodwill of NH Hoteles
Deutschland, GmbH and NH Hoteles Austria, GmbH (2,721 thousand euros in 2019). This impairment
is derived from the worsening due to openings of competitors and deterioration of the business
prospects due to Covid-19 situation.

   - Other intangible assets: it has been registered under the heading "Gains/(Net losses) from asset
impairment" on the consolidated comprehensive income statement for 2020, impairment losses
amounting to 1,497 thousand euros and reversal of impairment amounting to 337 thousand euros (436
thousand euros in 2019).

   - Real Estate investments: it has been registered a reversal of impairment of real estate investments
amounting to 60 thousand euros.

On the other hand, as a result of analysis of the fair value of these holdings, a reversal for impairment was
recorded on the investment in Sotocaribe, S.L. for 6,926 thousand euros under the heading "Impairment on
financial investments".

The Group's policy on holdings in associated companies consists of ceasing to book losses in these companies if
the associated company's consolidated losses attributable to the Group are equivalent to or exceed the cost of its
holding in them, provided there are no additional contingencies or guarantees connected with existing losses.
The holding in Kensington Hotel Value Added I, Ltd is in this situation.

Others 1,896 1.976
**Total** **35,664** **35.327**

The “Subordinated loans to companies owning hotels operated by the Group through leases” item includes a
series of loans granted by the Group to companies which own hotels in countries such as Germany, Austria, the
Netherlands, Italy and Spain, and which are operated by the Group under a leasing agreement.

The main features of these agreements are as follows:

– Hotel rentals are not subject to evolution of the inflation rate or to that of any other index.

– The aforementioned subordinated loans accrue interest at a fixed rate of 3% per annum.

– Lease agreements establish a purchase right on properties subject to agreements that, as a general rule,
may be executed in the fifth, tenth and fifteenth year from the entry into force of the agreement.

The model used for these lease agreements has been analysed and independent experts consider them to be
operating leases. These hotels are covered by the scope of IFRS 16 and, therefore, from the transition date
involve recording a right of use asset and a leasing liability.

**14.-** **TRADE RECEIVABLES**

This item reflects different accounts receivable from the Group’s operations. Its detail is as follows:

in the hotels.

As at 31 December 2020, there were no restrictions on the receipt of dividends distributed by the companies in

Hotel Group S.A. Board of Directors have the right, as representatives or authorised officials, to dispose of bank
accounts located abroad, which are in the name of Group companies. The reason certain Board members have
the right to dispose of overseas bank accounts is that they are directors or board members of said subsidiaries.

NH Hotel Group S.A. holds other accounting documents, namely the consolidated annual accounts, from which
sufficient data can be extracted in relation to the aforementioned accounts.

**16.-** **ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED**
**OPERATIONS**

In accordance with IFRS 5, Non-current assets classified as held for sale and discontinued operations (Note 4.7),
the group has classified non-strategic assets under this heading which are undergoing divestment with
committed sales plans.

The assets classified as held for sale, after deducting their liabilities, were measured at the lower of their
carrying amount and the expected sales price minus costs.

Specifically, at 31 December 2019, the Group had classified the holdings in the companies Sotocaribe, S.L. and
Capredo Investments, GmbH as discontinued operations Given the uncertainty associated with these sales
processes, the Group has decided to continue consolidating these holdings. Sotocaribe, S.L. was consolidated by
the equity method (Note 12), while Capredo Investments, GmbH was consolidated by the global method.

On the other hand, at 30 June 2020, the Group recorded the property company “Onroerend Goed Beheer
Maatschappij Maas Best, B.V.”, owner of the NH Best hotel in the Netherlands, as available for sale. The sale
was concluded on 1 July 2020.

NH Hotel Group, S.A. share capital at 31 December 2020 comprised 392,180,243 fully subscribed and paid up
bearer shares with a par value of 2 euros each. All these shares carry identical voting and economic rights and
are traded on the Continuous Market of the Spanish Stock Exchanges.

According to the most recent notifications received by the Parent Company and the communications submitted
to the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) prior to the end of each reporting period, the
main shareholdings at 31 December were as follows:

31/12/2020 31/12/2019

Minor International Public Company Limited (“MINT”) 94,13% 94,13%

The aforementioned (indirect) shareholding of MINT in NH Hotel Group, S.A. is the result of the IPO made by
MHG Continental Holding (Singapore) Pte Ltd. on 11 June 2018 for 100% of the shares that were part of the
share capital of NH Hotel Group, S.A., the result of which was that MINT acquired, through its wholly owned
subsidiary MHG Continental Holding (Singapore) Pte. Ltd, shares representing 94.13% of the share capital of
NH Hotel Group, S.A.

**17.2** **Dividends**

As mentioned in note 3, the Group did not distribute dividends in 2020.

On the other hand, the General Shareholders' Meeting on 13 May 2019 approved, among other items, the
proposed distribution of dividends. It therefore decided to draw from the profits of the year ended 31 December
2018 and distribute a dividend of 15 euro cents gross per share in the parent company NH Hotel Group, S.A.
with the right to receive it, outstanding on the date of the payment; all according to the following schedule:

This dividend was distributed through the companies with shares in “Sociedad de Gestión de los Sistemas de
Registro, Compensación y Liquidación de Valores, S.A. Unipersonal” (IBERCLEAR), with powers granted for
this purpose to the Board of Directors, with express powers of substitution, so that after checking for compliance
with obligations under the finance contracts of NH HOTEL GROUP, S.A., the Board will designate an entity to
act as paying agent and will perform the other necessary or advisable actions for a satisfactory distribution. The
total amount distributed as dividends was 58.771 million euros.

**17.3** **Reserves of the Parent Company**

i) Legal reserve

In accordance with the Consolidated Text of the Corporate Enterprises Act, 10% of the net profit for
each year must be allocated to the legal reserve until it reaches at least 20% of share capital. The legal
reserve may be used to increase capital provided the remaining balance does not fall below 10% of
the increased capital amount. With the exception of the aforementioned purpose, and when it does not
exceed 20% of share capital, this reserve may be used only to offset losses, provided no other
reserves are available for this purpose.

At 31 December 2020 and 2019, the parent company's legal reserve was not fully constituted.

ii) Share premium

The Consolidated Text of the Corporate Enterprises Act expressly allows the balance of this reserve
to be used to increase capital and imposes no restrictions on its availability.

**17.4** **Treasury shares**

At 31 December 2020, the Group had 103,947 own shares, compared to 374,464 own shares at 31 December
2019. The reduction in treasury shares over the period can be explained by the following movement:

   - On 10 April 2019, the Group signed a liquidity contract to manage its treasury shares with Banco
Santander, which entered into force on 11 April 2019. The total number of shares allocated to the
securities account associated with the new Liquidity Contract at 31 December 2020 is 103,947 shares
and the amount allocated to the cash account is 400,000 euros. At 31 December 2019, the number of
shares assigned to the liquidity contract was 83,176 shares. The negative effect recorded in reserves for
operations carried out in the 2020 financial year was 245 thousand euros.

   - In the 2020 financial year, the first cycle of the second long-term incentive plan was settled (Note 25).
For the settlement of this second cycle a purchase of 110,350 treasury shares was made. The second
cycle was settled by the delivery of 401,638 shares. The total impact recorded in equity due to these
movements was 1,525 thousand euros.

**Obligations required in the senior notes contracts maturing in 2023, the syndicated credit line and the**
**syndicated loan with ICO guarantee maturing in 2023**

The senior notes maturing in 2023 and the syndicated credit line require the fulfilment of a series of obligations
and limitations of essentially homogeneous content as regards the assumption of additional borrowing or
provision of guarantees in favour of third parties, the granting of real guarantees on assets, the sale of assets,
investments that are permitted, restricted payments (including the distribution of dividends to shareholders),
transactions between related parties, corporate transactions and disclosure obligations. These obligations are
detailed in the issue prospectus for the aforementioned notes, as well as in the credit agreement of the syndicated
credit line.

The syndicated credit line requires compliance with financial ratios; in particular (i) an interest coverage ratio of

- 2.00x, (ii) a net indebtedness ratio of < 5.50x, and (iii) a Loan to Value ("LTV") ratio which, as a result of the

any given time as indicated below:

   - Net debt-to-income ratio ˃ 4.00x: LTV ratio = 70%
   - Net debt-to-income ratios ≤ 4.00x: LTV ratio = 85%
   - Net debt-to-income ratio ≤ 3.50x: LTV ratio = 100%

The maximum permitted LTV at 31 December 2020 was 70%.

Moreover, the syndicated loan with the ICO guarantee maturing in 2023 requires compliance with financial
ratios; in particular, (i) an interest coverage ratio of > 2.00x, (ii) a net indebtedness ratio of < 5.50x

In addition to the waiver obtained in June 2020 for compliance with the financial covenants included in the
syndicated credit line for the months of June and December 2020, unanimous approval from the loan institutions
was obtained to extend the waiver until June 2021. This waiver until June 2021 also extends to the syndicated
loan with the ICO guarantee maturing in 2023.

**Limitation on the distribution of Dividends**

The guaranteed senior notes maturing in 2023, the syndicated credit line and the syndicated loan with the ICO
guarantee maturing in 2023 described above contain clauses limiting the distribution of dividends.

In the case of the senior notes maturing in 2023, the distribution of dividends is generally permitted provided
that (a) the interest coverage ratio is > 2.0x and (b) the sum of restricted payments (including dividends and
repayment of subordinated debt) made since 8 November 2013 is less than the sum of, amongst other items, (I)
50% of NH's consolidated net income (even though in the calculation of net income,100% of consolidated net
losses must be deducted) from 1 July 2013 to the date of the last quarterly accounts available (this is what is
known as the CNI Builder) and, (ii) 100% of the net contributions to NH’s capital from 8 November 2013.

Additionally, as an alternative and without having to be in compliance with the previous condition: (i) in the
case of bonds maturing in 2023, NH may distribute dividends provided that the leverage ratio (gross debt/
EBITDA) does not exceed 4.5x.

Finally, and also alternatively and without having to be concurrent with the previous ones, the notes maturing in
2023 establish a franchise to be able to make restricted payments (including dividends) without needing to
comply with any specific requirement, for a total aggregate amount of 25,000,000 euros as of November 2013.

In the case of the syndicated credit line, and as a result of the extension of its maturity date until March 2023, as
agreed in October 2020, distribution of dividends in the 2021 financial year is not permitted.

From 2022 onwards, according to the syndicated credit line and the loan with the ICO guarantee maturing in
2023, the distribution of a percentage of the NH Group’s consolidated net profit from the previous year is
allowed, provided that there has been no breach of the financing agreement and the Net Financial Debt (through
the Dividend payment) / EBITDA Ratio is less than 4.0x.

The maximum percentage of consolidated net profit to distribute will depend on the Net Financial Debt (through
the Dividend payment) /EBITDA Ratio according to the following breakdown:

- Net Financial Debt /EBITDA ≤ 4.0x: Percentage of consolidated net profit: 75%

- Net Financial Debt /EBITDA ≤ 3.5x: Percentage of consolidated net profit: 100%

- Net Financial Debt /EBITDA ≤ 3.0x: Percentage of consolidated net profit: unlimited

All of these metrics are calculated using consolidated data.

At 31 December of the 2020 financial year, the requirements for distribution of dividends charged against that
financial year were not met.

**19.-** **TAX NOTE**

**Tax consolidation scheme**

The Group operates in many countries and is therefore subject to the regulations of different tax jurisdictions
regarding taxation and corporate income tax.

NH Hotel Group, S.A. and another 18 companies with tax domicile in Spain in which it held a direct or indirect
stake of at least 75% during the 2020 tax period are subject to the tax consolidation scheme governed by Title
VII, Chapter VI of Law 27/2014 on Corporate Income Tax.

The companies belonging to the tax group have signed an agreement to share the tax burden. Hence, the Parent
Company settles any credits and debts which arise with subsidiary companies due to the negative and positive
tax bases these contribute to the tax group.

The companies that make up the tax consolidation group are the following:

NH Hotel Group, S.A. NH Europa, S.L.
Latinoamericana de Gestión Hotelera, S.L. Atardecer Caribeño, S.L.
NH Central Reservation Office, S.L. Hoteles Hesperia, S.A.
NH Hoteles España, S.A. Nuevos Espacios Hoteleros, S.A.
NH Hotel Ciutat De Reus, S.A. Coperama Holding, S.L.
Gran Círculo de Madrid, S.A. Coperama Spain, S.L.
Iberinterbrokers, S.L. NH Las Palmas, S.A.
Wilan Ander, S.L. NH Lagasca, S.A.
Palacio de la Merced, S.A. Wilan Huel S.L.

NH Cash Link, S.L.U.

Corporation tax is calculated on the financial or accounting profit or loss resulting from the application of
generally accepted accounted standards in each country, and does not necessarily coincide with the tax result,
this being construed as the tax base.

In 2020, Spanish companies pay taxes at the general tax rate of 25% irrespective of whether they apply the
consolidated or separate taxation schemes. The foreign companies are subject to the prevailing tax rate in the
countries where they are domiciled. In addition, taxes are recognised in some countries at the estimated
minimum profit on a complementary basis to Corporation Tax.

The prevailing corporation tax rates applicable to Group companies in the different jurisdictions where the
Group has significant operations are as follows:


-----

**Country** **Nominal tax rate Country** **Nominal tax rate**
Argentina 25% Italy 24%
Austria 25% Luxembourg 17%
Belgium 25% Mexico 30%
Brazil 34% Netherlands 25%
Chile 27% Poland 19%
Colombia 33% Portugal 21%
Czech R. 19% Romania 16%
Dominican R. 27% South Africa 28%
Ecuador 25% Spain 25%
France 28% Switzerland 9%
Germany 30% United Kingdom 19%
Hungary 9% Uruguay 25%
Ireland 12.5% USA 21%

**Financial years subject to tax inspection**

In accordance with Spanish tax legislation, the years open for review to the Consolidated Tax Group are:

**Unaudited**
**Tax** **Periods**
Corporation 2014 a 2019
VAT 2017 a 2020
IRPF (personal income tax) 2017 a 2020
Non-resident Income Tax 2017 a 2020

In Spain during 2020, the Tax Administration began a partial verification process to reduce the taxable base of
revenues from certain intangible assets referred to in article 23 of the Corporation Tax Act, which had
commenced in 2019 and includes the years 2016 to 2018. This verification by the Administration validated the
application of the incentive in the Spanish tax group, but amended some points of the calculation method. The
result was a cash outflow of 619 thousand euros for tax payable and interest. The verification did not give rise to
sanctions being imposed. Furthermore, for the Tax group in Spain, the verification involved consumption of
activated tax credits of 263 thousand euros. Given that the company had recorded a provision of 1 million euros
in the previous tax year, the impact on the corporation tax heading on the profit and loss account was income of
123 thousand euros.

In Germany, an inspection procedure has been opened which is reviewing the amount of negative tax bases still
to be offset by the companies. Furthermore, a verification file is open for all the taxes in some of the German
companies which covers the 2015 to 2018 financial years.

The inspection process at the subsidiary company in Austria was finalised in the 2020 financial year. The final
settlement lead to a cash outflow of 126 thousand euros which will be paid up in 2021. The verification did not
involve sanctions being imposed.

The verification process in Portugal was finalised in the 2020 financial year, with the result of tax payable and
interest of 165 thousand euros. This amount was paid in 2020 itself.

Finally, an inspection procedure has been opened in Colombia focused on the deductions of certain Corporation
Tax expenses.


-----

The Group’s Directors do not expect any significant contingencies to arise from the conclusions of the
inspections.

Regarding the financial years open to inspection in the rest of the group, contingent liabilities not susceptible to
objective quantification may exist, which are not significant in the opinion of the Group’s Directors. Moreover,
the Company considers that there are no significant uncertain tax positions.

**Total** **273,013** **220.040**

All these impacts have had an effect on the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statements, apart from
the change due to the entry into the scope of consolidation arising from the agreement reached with Boscolo
Hotels to integrate eight hotels in Italy, Hungary, the Czech Republic and France into the NH Group, and some
insignificant impacts that involved change to the consolidated statements of changes in equity.

The increase in deferred tax assets is mainly due to the generation of assets due to tax losses as a result of the
losses in 2020 caused by the slump in the sector due to the impact of the worldwide health crisis.

At 31 December 2020, the Group had assets resulting from tax losses and deductions amounting to 132,377
thousand euros (83,881 thousand euros in 2019). Out of the total tax credits, 79,067 thousand euros relates to
credits activated in Spain. In accordance with the above, no tax credits were generated due to the loss generated
in 2020 in the Spanish tax group.

In the 2020 financial year, the movement of tax credit assets was 48,496 thousand euros. The increase in tax
credits was due to the activation of the loss for the financial year, mainly in Germany (20,872 thousand euros),
Italy (14,659 thousand euros), Benelux (4,599 thousand euros), Portugal (3,759 thousand euros) and Latin
America (3,526 thousand euros). To activate these credits, the relevant plans for tax credit recovery were
prepared to support their activation. There was no additional activation of credits for tax losses in the Spanish
tax group.

At 31 December 2020, the Group had tax loss carryforwards worth 745,474 thousand euros (594,222 thousand
euros at 31 December 2019) and deductions amounting to 29,136 thousand euros (27,695 thousand euros in
2019) that had not been entered in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet because the Directors
considered they did not meet accounting standard requirements. These assets are grouped as follows (base

Finance costs, which are not considered deductible in the Spanish corporate income tax when exceeding 30% of
the operating revenue of the tax group calculated in accordance with Article 16 of Law 27/2014 of 27
December, on Corporate Income Tax, amount to 205,337 thousand euros in 2020 (191,799 thousand euros in
2019). There is no deadline for offsetting non-deductible finance costs.

The change to the credits not recorded in the 2020 financial year is mainly due to the negative tax base
generated in Spanish tax group's loss in the year (86,153 thousand euros) which was not activated.

The reduction in deferred tax liabilities is mainly due to the allotment of impairment to revalued assets in the
moment of the acquisition. In addition, liabilities have increased by 11,458 thousand euros as a result of the
entry of eight hotels in Italy, Hungary, the Czech Republic and France into the scope of consolidation after the
agreement reached with Boscolo Hotels (Note 6).

At 1 January 2019, due to the application of IFRS 16, the provision for onerous contracts is registered as the
lower value of the right of use (Note 2).

**Provision for pensions and similar obligations**

The “Provisions for pensions and similar obligations” account mainly includes the pension fund of a certain
number of employees of the Netherlands business unit, and the T.F.R. “Trattamento di fine rapporto” in Italy, an
amount paid to all workers in Italy at the moment they leave the company for any reason. This is another
remuneration element, whose payment is deferred and annually allocated in proportion to fixed and variable
remuneration both in kind and in cash, which is valued on a regular basis. The annual amount to be reserved is
equivalent to the remuneration amount divided by 13.5. The annual cumulative fund is reviewed at a fixed
interest rate of 1.5% plus 75% of the increase in the consumer price index (CPI).

This section also includes various retirement, performance related and/or long-stay awards considered in the
Collective Bargaining Agreements that are applicable in Spain.

In the 2019 financial year, the allocations column included the change in accounting criteria of 12,191 thousand
euros, resulting in a net impact of taxes on equity of 9,692 thousand euros. (Note 2.4).

At the end of 2020, the liabilities entered against this item were of 29,224 thousand euros (28,919 thousand
euros at 31 December 2019).

The above information on payments to suppliers of Spanish companies refer to those which by their nature are
trade creditors due to debts with suppliers of goods and services. The table includes, therefore, the "Commercial
Creditors and Other Accounts Payable" item in current liabilities of the consolidated balance sheet.

The average period for payment to suppliers has been calculated, as stated in the Resolution of 29 January 2016,
of the Institute of Accounting and Auditing, using the weighted average of the two ratios explained below:

– Ratio of paid transactions: average payment period of transactions paid in each year weighted by the
amount of each transaction.

– Ratio of transactions pending payment: average period between the invoice date and the end of the year
weighted by the amount of each transaction.

**23.-** **OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES**

At 31 December, this item is broken down as follows:

Thousand euros
2020 2019

Outstanding remuneration 19,175 40.274
Other creditors 5,920 8.761
**25,095** **49.035**

**24.-** **THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES AND CLAIMS IN PROCESS**

At 31 December 2020, NH had a total of 34,052 thousand euros in economic or financial bank guarantees issued
by various banks (30,371 thousand euros in 2019).

The increase in the balance of bank guarantees at 31 December 2020, compared to the balance at 31 December
2019, is mainly due to the issue of a new bond for 2,000 thousand euros and the reduction in the amount on
renewal of some of them.

Of the 34,052 thousand euros in bank guarantees, 29,848 thousand euros guarantee leasing contract obligations
and others related to the Group's usual operations in various countries, and 4,203 thousand euros issued in
relation to public bodies.

At 31 December 2020, the Group had taken out insurance policies to cover risks arising from damage to
material goods, loss of profits and third-party liability. The capital insured sufficiently covers the assets and
risks mentioned above.

**Commitments to third parties**

###### – On 10 March 2006, the partnership agreement of the company which owns a hotel in the United
Kingdom was signed, of which a group company is a shareholder, under which, if the company were to
receive a purchase offer for 100% of its shares at market price, the Group company could be required to
transfer the shares. However, the group company will have preferential acquisition rights over the
shares. At the close of the financial year, the group company had granted its shareholder an option to
purchase shares representing up to 6.96% of the company capital of the company owning the hotel.

– Within the framework of new development projects in the normal course of business, in which Grupo
NH subsidiaries act as lessees or operators, the Group's parent company gives personal guarantees in
favour of third parties to secure its contractual obligations, often issue promissory notes in payment of
said obligations and agrees penalty clauses in case of breach of contract.

– Likewise, within the framework of the group's financing, personal and real guarantees have been
granted to fulfil the obligations guaranteed under the financing agreements (Note 18).

**Claims in process**

The Group's main contingent assets and liabilities on the date these consolidated financial statements were drawn up,
are set out below:
###### – The owner of four properties in the Netherlands has claimed in court the payment of compensation to a
Dutch subsidiary because there was allegedly a change of the control situation in the year 2014, which
supposedly entitles him to claim a fine, according to the lease. The claim filed by the owner, both in the
first instance and on appeal, was dismissed in full. The same owner has instituted fresh court
proceedings alleging a change of control situation in 2018, as the claim was dismissed in the first
instance and the appeal is currently pending resolution.

– A claim has been filed against a Grupo NH company in Germany due to the termination of two lease
agreements and claiming specific amounts, including damages.

– A claim has been filed against an NH Group company in Italy due to the early termination of a lease
agreement; the ruling was favourable to the company's interests in the appeal, although it is in judicial
review currently in progress.

– An NH Group company in Italy has been sued with damages under a service provision contract
requested.

– An NH Group company in South Africa has been sued for damages as a result of the termination of a
lease agreement.

– A claim has been filed against two of the Group's companies seeking payment fees to rights
management from 1 January 2008 to 31 May 2013, in addition to an unspecified amount corresponding
to the period thereafter until a judgement is issued, plus interest and costs. The procedure from both
first instance and appeal has been resolved by setting an amount lower than the one claimed, however,
a judicial review has been filed, which is pending a hearing.

– A claim has been filed against an NT Group company claiming payment in relation to the payment of a
management entity’s fees for the years 2018, 2019, et seq, which is currently being processed.

– A claim has been filed against an NH Group company for damages within the framework of a corporate
relationship.


-----

– On the occasion of the agreements reached in 2014 for the sale of the shares held by NH Hotel Group,
S.A in the company Sotogrande, S.A., Grupo NH agreed to subrogate to the position of Sotogrande,
S.A. for certain claims assuming all rights and obligations relating thereto, and are summarised as
follows:

        - Plaintiff in the proceedings against construction agents for construction defects in twenty-five
homes and contractual liability.

        - Respondent in the process of claiming amounts from a real estate development due to
construction defects.

        - The company may be subject to a claim for amounts derived from an eventual administrative
claim.

– A former shareholder of the NH Group has requested the annulment of certain resolutions adopted by
the Board of Directors, and the proceedings are currently in progress.

– As part of the contractual liability assumed by the NH Group in the 2013 hotel purchase contract, the
buyers informed the Group of the requirement to pay the Dutch Capital Transfer Tax. At 31 December
2020, the total amount of this tax, plus the corresponding default interest, was 12,300 thousand euros.
The purchasers submitted an appeal to the Dutch Treasury that was rejected and an appeal has been
filed with the Courts that is still pending resolution. The NH Group and the purchasers reached an
agreement whereby NH assumed control of the judicial procedure.

The Directors of the Parent Company consider that the hypothetical loss incurred by the Group as a result of
such actions would not significantly affect the equity of the Group.

**25.-** **LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN**

On 25 June 2013, the Company's General Shareholders Meeting approved a long-term share-based incentive
plan (“the plan”) for the NH Hotel Group SA's executives and employees, as follows:

The plan consisted of the grant of ordinary shares of NH Hotel Group, S.A. to the beneficiaries calculated as a
percentage of the fixed salary, according to their level of responsibility. The number of shares to be granted was
subject to the degree of fulfilment of the following objectives:

– TSR (total shareholder return) at the end of each of the plan cycles, comparing the performance of NH
Hotel Group, SA shares with the following indices:
◦ IBEX Medium Cap
◦ Dow Jones Euro STOXX Travel & Leisure
– EBITDA, discounting the amount corresponding to rentals compared annually with the forecasts of the
Company's strategic plan.

If the minimum degree of fulfilment established in the aforementioned objectives were not achieved, the plan's
beneficiaries will not be entitled to shares under said plan.

The plan was aimed at a maximum of 100 beneficiaries. The Board of Directors, at the proposal of the CEO,
may include new members in the plan.

The plan had a total duration of five years, divided into three three-year cycles.

In 2019, the third and final cycle of the first plan was settled with the delivery of 226,067 net shares at a fair
value per unit of 4.55 euros. The settlement of the plan was made net of taxes.


-----

On the other hand, the 2017 Shareholders' Meeting approved the launch of a new Long-Term Incentive Plan.
This plan has a duration of five years, divided into three three-year cycles. The current cycles at 31 December
2020 are:

No. of Shares
Assigned at No. of live Value of
the start of shares at the
each cycle 31.12.2020 allocation
(Thousands) (Thousands) (Euros)

The second cycle began on 01/01/2018 (delivery in 2021 (in force)) 517,96 421,99 5,96
The third cycle began on 01/01/2019 (delivery in 2022 (in force)) 879,25 760,76 3,96

The difference between the total shares assigned at the beginning of each cycle and the live shares at 31
December 2020 are beneficiaries who left between the launch and 31 December 2020.

This second plan has a very similar structure to the first; delivery of ordinary shares of NH Hotel Group, S.A. to
the beneficiaries calculated as a percentage of fixed salary, according to their level of responsibility.

The number of shares to be delivered shall be subject to the degree of fulfilment of the following four
objectives:

###### ◦ TSR (total shareholder return) at the end of each of the plan cycles, comparing the performance of
NH Hotel Group, S.A. shares with the STOXX® Europe 600 Travel & Leisure share index.
###### ◦ Revaluation of the Share. ◦ Recurring Net Profit. ◦ Recurring EBITDA.

The beneficiaries must remain in the Group at the end of each cycle, notwithstanding the exceptions deemed
appropriate, as well as achieving the minimum thresholds for each of the objectives.

The Board of Directors will be authorised to decide, before the start of each of the cycles, the effective
implementation thereof in accordance with the Group's financial position at the time. At the date of publication
of this report, all the cycles had been approved by the Board of Directors.

The maximum amount approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting for the three cycles of the second Plan is
16,200,000 euros.

In addition, the first cycle of the new incentive plan, which began on 1 January 2017, was wholly settled in the
first half of 2020 with the delivery of 401,638 net shares at a fair value per unit of 4.68 euros. The settlement of
this plan was made net of taxes.

During 2020, no impact has been recorded in the consolidated profit and loss statement as it is not expected to
meet the objectives described above (the impact recorded in 2019 was 3,569 thousand euros).

The fall in the net turnover was due to the Covid-19 pandemic. From the middle of March demand in the hotel
sector decreased drastically due to lockdown and travel restrictions.

“Rentals and Other Services” includes the income from fees invoiced to hotels operated on a management basis
and the services provided by the NH Group to third parties.

Other social expenses 6,895 13.255

**268,174** **448.762**

The decrease in personnel costs can be explained by the contingency plans that the Group put in place to
alleviate the fall in business due to Covid-19. Mainly these consisted of temporary layoffs, due to force majeure
or productive reasons, and voluntary reductions in working days and wages.

The saving recorded in 2020, as a result of the subsidies or allowances received from Governments to offset the
restrictive measures taken, was approximately 36,932 thousand euros in wages and salaries and 15,795 thousand
euros in social security contributions.

long-term employment as much as possible, has launched a contingency plan to temporarily reduce its
workforce and, consequently, adjust its personnel costs to the reality of the business, through contract
suspensions, reductions in working hours, request for extraordinary subsidies available in some countries,
cancellations of vacancies and / or other measures taken according to the labour legislation in each country.

Almost all of the workforce (86%), in all professional categories, has been affected by some of these measures,
affecting men and women equally.

The Group experienced a decrease in the level of activity of its hotel business in 2020 as a result of Covid-19.
At the start of the pandemic, the Group implemented a contingency plan that includes a severe reduction in fixed
and variable costs directly related to the activity level.

The high degree of uncertainty required the fixed cost structure to be minimised and operations adapted. The
enormous effort in efficiency and cost control has practically covered operating costs before rentals.

The "Taxes, insurance and levies" heading includes property tax allowances or rebates received from some City
Councils to offset the temporary closure of some hotels. The total amount was approximately 1,684 thousand
euros.

On the other hand, during 2020, the Group managed to reach agreements with the vast majority of landlords,
which has made it possible to obtain rent concessions to significantly mitigate the impact of the pandemic. In
this sense, as a result of applying the IFRS 16 amendment published on 28 May 2020, the Group recorded
savings of 46,195 thousand euros relating to rent concessions achieved in the aforementioned negotiations
carried out as a result of Covid-19 (Note 2.2). In addition, as a result of the drop in business and renegotiations
and write-offs, expenses for variable rents, as well as those which are not subject to IFRS 16, were reduced.

During 2020 and 2019, the fees for account auditing and other services provided by the auditor of the Group's

**28.-** **INFORMATION BY SEGMENTS**

**28.1 Information on main segments**

The Group divides its activity into the real estate (Note 12) and hotel segments. Additionally, within the hotel
segment, sub-segments are identified by geographic area, which are included in the breakdowns reflected in the
consolidated financial statements for information purposes.

The factors taken into account when defining the segments were as follows:

a) They carry on business activities from which they can earn income from ordinary activities and incur
expenses (including income from ordinary activities and expenses for transactions with other
components of the Group).

b) They obtain operating results that are regularly reviewed by the entity's highest decision-making
authority to decide on the resources to be allocated to the segment and to evaluate its performance.

c) They have different financial information.

The Management Committee is the body responsible for making decisions on the Group’s segments.
Accordingly, it analyses the Group’s results, distinguishing between the aforementioned sub-segments.

The breakdown of the segment information required by IFRS 8 is as follows:

In relation to the heading, "Transactions on shares and/or other financial instruments", consideration has been
given to the objective long-term remuneration accrued. Remuneration in kind (vehicles and medical insurance)
is included under “Others”.

**29.2 Remuneration of senior management**

The remuneration of members of the Management Committee during the year, excluding those who
simultaneously held office as members of the Board of Directors (whose remuneration has been set out above),
is detailed below:

|Remuneration item|Thousand euros|Col3|
|---|---|---|
||2020|2019|
|Fixed remuneration Variable remuneration Parent Company: allowances Parent Company: attendance allowances Transactions in shares and other financial instruments Life insurance premiums Others|807 — 3 221 257 33 20|1.016 729 11 589 491 31 20|
|Total|1,341|2.887|

|Pecuniary remuneration Remuneration in kind Others|1,277 98 462|2.745 86 670|
|Total|1,837|3.501|


There were 6 members of Senior Management at 31 December 2020 (6 members at 31 December 2019)
excluding the CEO and the Chief Operations Officer due to their status as executive directors.

The notable decrease in remuneration is explained by the crisis caused by Covid-19, due to which the annual
remuneration of members of the Management Committee in 2020 decreased by more than 50%.

The Chief Operations Officer’s remuneration prior to being appointed Executive Director is shown as Senior
Management.

Remuneration in kind includes the vehicle and the cost of insurance.

The heading Other takes the long-term objective remuneration accrued in 2020 into consideration.

**29.3 Information on conflicts of interest on the part of Directors**

During 2020, Minor International Public Company Limited (“Minor”), an indirect majority shareholder of NH
(94.132%) and represented on the Board by four proprietary Directors, and NH signed a series of Related Party
Transactions, which are broken down in the Audit and Control Committee's Annual Report, as well as in Note
27 of this Report. These Related Party Transactions have always been executed in strict compliance with the
rules established in the applicable regulations and the Procedure for Conflicts of Interest and Related Party
Transactions with Significant Shareholders, Directors and Senior Management of NH Hotel Group, S.A.
approved by the Board of Directors on 26 March 2014. All transactions signed with Minor (and/or its group of
companies) have counted on a report from the Audit and Control Committee, have been signed under market
conditions and with the participation of external advisors, and in compliance with the provisions in the
Framework Agreement signed between the parties on 7 February 2019, which regulates, among others, the
scope of action of the respective hotel groups headed by NH and Minor through the identification of preferred
geographic areas or zones, the mechanisms necessary to prevent and deal with possible conflicts of interest, as
well as to carry out operations with related parties and develop business opportunities. The aforementioned
Framework Agreement was duly communicated to the Market via a Relevant Fact and is published in full on the
Company's website.

During all Board Meetings dealing with issues related to Minor, the Proprietary Directors were absent when
dealing with said matters and therefore did not participate in the adoption of the corresponding agreement.

**30.-** **INFORMATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY**

For the NH Hotel Group, environmental sustainability drives innovation, seeking to surprise our guests as well
as achieving efficiencies in the use of natural resources, particularly water and energy. In our responsible
commitment to the Planet, we work to minimise our impact on Climate Change, increase the efficiency of
resources and develop more sustainable services. All this minimises our environmental footprint with
responsible consumption of natural resources.

The Company's environmental strategy is driven by NH ROOM4 Planet, which defines the roadmap for
complying with the commitments acquired in the fight against climate change and progress towards
decarbonisation, efficient management and responsible consumption of resources and the circular economy, and
developing more sustainable products, but also involving employees, suppliers, shareholders and customers as
key players in achieving them.


-----

In order to formalise the extension of these commitments to the entire operation and NH Hotel Group's decision
making process, in 2020, at a meeting of the Board of Directors held on 29 July, the new Environmental and
Energy Policy was approved.

At NH Hotel Group the fight against climate change is a fundamental strategic value. This is way the Company
was the first Spanish hotelier to establish targets for reducing emissions, scientifically validated by the Science
Based Targets initiative (SBTi) last year. Therefore, NH Hotel Group formalised its commitment to reduce its
carbon emissions by 20% throughout its value chain up to 2030, preventing the emission of more than 70,000
tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. This objective marks NH Hotel Group's roadmap towards a significant
reduction in its activity’s carbon footprint in the coming years, aligned with the purpose set in the Paris
Agreement, and join the efforts that are being made globally towards the transition to a low carbon economy.

**31.-** **RISK EXPOSURE**

Group financial risk management is centralized in the Corporate Finance Division in accordance with the
policies approved by the Board of Directors. This Division has put the necessary measures in place to control
exposure to changes in interest and exchange rates on the basis of the Group’s structure and financial position,
as well as credit and liquidity risks. If necessary, hedges are made on a case-by-case basis. The main financial
risks faced by the Group’s policies are described below:

**Credit risk**

The Group main financial assets include cash and cash equivalents (Note 15), as well as trade and other
accounts receivable (Note 14). In general terms, the Group holds its cash and cash equivalents in entities with a
high credit rating and part of its trade and other accounts receivable are guaranteed by deposits, bank guarantees
and advance payments by tour operators.

The Group has no significant concentration of third-party credit risk due to the diversification of its financial
investments as well as to the distribution of trade risks with short collection periods among a large number of
customers.

The Group has formal procedures for detecting objective evidence of impairment in trade receivables for the
provision of services. As a result of these, significant delays in payment terms and the methods to be followed in
estimating the impairment loss based on individual analyses are identified. Impairment of trade receivables from
customers for the provision of services at 31 December 2020 amounted to 9,025 thousand euros (7,100 thousand
euros at 31 December 2019) (Note 14) and customer balances not included in this provision have sufficient
credit quality and, therefore, with this provision, the credit risk of these trade receivable is considered covered.

**Interest rate risk**

The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, which may have an
adverse effect on its results and cash flows. In order to mitigate this risk, the Group has established policies and
has part of its debt at fixed interest rates through the issue of guaranteed convertible senior bonds. At 31
December 2020, approximately 39% of the gross borrowings was tied to fixed interest rates (excluding leasing
liabilities).

In accordance with reporting requirements set forth in IFRS 7, the Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on
possible interest-rate fluctuations in the markets in which it operates, based on these requirements.

Through the sensitivity analysis, taking as a reference the outstanding amount of that financing that has variable
interest, we estimated the increase in the interest that would arise in the event of a rise in the reference interest
rates.


-----

###### • If the increase in interest rates were 25 bp, the financial expense would increase by 1,544 thousand
euros plus interest.

###### • If the increase in interest rates were 50 bp, the financial expense would increase by 3,088 thousand
euros plus interest.

###### • If the increase in interest rates were 100 bp, the financial expense would increase by 6,176 thousand
euros plus interest.

The results in equity would be similar to those recorded in the income statement but taking into account their tax
effect, if any.

Lastly, the long-term financial assets set out in Note 13 of this annual report are also subject to interest-rate
risks.

**Exchange rate risk**

The Group is exposed to exchange-rate fluctuations that may affect its sales, results, equity and cash flows.
These mainly arise from:

###### – Investments in foreign countries (essentially Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador,
the Dominican Republic, Brazil, Panama and the United States).
###### – Transactions made by Group companies operating in countries whose currency is other than the euro
(essentially Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic,
Venezuela, Brazil, the United States and the United Kingdom).

In this respect, the detail of the effect on the currency translation difference of the main currencies in 2020 was
as follows:

Thousand euros
Currency translation Changes with
difference respect to 2019

Uruguayan peso (4,647) (2,023)

Mexican peso (22,207) (5,611)

Colombian peso (32,498) (7,977)

The changes in the currency translation difference of the above currencies was mainly due to the movements in
exchange rates between 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019:

|Col1|Thousand euros|Col3|
|---|---|---|
||Currency translation difference|Changes with respect to 2019|
|Uruguayan peso Mexican peso Colombian peso|(4,647) (22,207) (32,498)|(2,023) (5,611) (7,977)|

|Year-end euro reference exchange rate|2020|2019|Variation|
|---|---|---|---|
|Uruguayan peso Mexican peso Colombian peso|0,019240 0,040960 0,000240|0,023800 0,047120 0,000270|(19,16%) (13,07%) (11,11%)|


-----

As can be observed in the table, the movements in the exchange rate of the currencies with respect to the end of
the previous year is in line with the changes in equity associated with these currencies.

Below is a detail of the movements in the average exchange rate between 2020 and 2019 of the aforementioned
currencies:

Average euro reference
exchange rate in the year 2020 2019 Variation

Uruguayan peso 0,020840 0,025360 (17,82%)
Mexican peso 0,040790 0,046390 (12,07%)
Colombian peso 0,000240 0,000270 (11,11%)

For these currencies an analysis was carried out to determine if it would be better to apply a monthly average or
cumulative average exchange rate, and no significant difference resulted from this analysis.

**Liquidity risk**

Exposure to adverse situations in debt or capital markets could hinder or prevent the Group from meeting the
financial needs required for its operations and for implementing its Strategic Plan.

Management of this risk is focused on thoroughly monitoring the maturity schedule of the Group’s financial
debt, as well as on proactive management and maintaining credit lines that allow forecast cash needs to be met.

The Group's liquidity position at 31 December 2020 is based on the following points:

– The group had cash and cash equivalents amounting to 320,851 thousand euros.

– Available undrawn credit facilities of 25,000 thousand euros (Note 18).

The capacity of the business units to generate positive cash flows from operations.

Lastly, the Group makes cash flow forecasts on a systematic basis for each business unit and geographical area
in order to assess their needs. This Group liquidity policy ensures payment undertakings are fulfilled without
having to request funds at onerous conditions and allows its liquidity position to be monitored on a continuous
basis.

**32.- EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD**

On 12 February 2021, the Group informed the workers of its central and corporate services in Spain of its
intention to begin collective redundancies. The documentation that will make up the corresponding file will be
transferred in a timely manner to both the labour authority and to the Committees that are set up for the
negotiations. The conditions and the number of those affected will be subject to negotiation. All of this happens
in accordance with the provisions of Article 51 of Royal Legislative Decree 2/2015, of 23 October which
approves the Consolidated Text of the Workers' Statute Law and Royal Decree 1483/2012, of 29 October that
approves the Regulations for the Procedures for Collective Redundancy and Suspension of Contracts and
Reduction of Working Hours.

|Average euro reference exchange rate in the year|2020|2019|Variation|
|---|---|---|---|
|Uruguayan peso Mexican peso Colombian peso|0,020840 0,040790 0,000240|0,025360 0,046390 0,000270|(17,82%) (12,07%) (11,11%)|

###### Audit report on the consolidated annual accounts
 issued by an independent auditor

To the shareholders of NH Hotel Group, S.A.:

###### Report on the consolidated annual accounts

**Opinion**

We have audited the consolidated annual accounts of NH Hotel Group, S.A. (the parent company) and
its subsidiaries (the Group), consisting of the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2019,
consolidated profit and loss statement, consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity,
consolidated cash flow statement and the notes to the consolidated annual accounts for the year then
ended.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated annual accounts present fairly, in all material respects,
the Group's consolidated equity and financial position at 31 December 2019 and the consolidated
results of its operations and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the
International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU) and other
provisions of the financial reporting framework applicable in Spain.

**Basis for opinion**

We have performed our audit in accordance with audit regulations in force in Spain. Our
responsibilities under said regulations are described below under Responsibilities of the auditor in
_relation to the audit of the consolidated annual accounts._

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements, including those relating
to independence, applicable to our audit of the consolidated annual accounts in Spain, as required by
auditing regulations. In this respect, we have not provided any services other than audit services, nor
have any situations or circumstances arisen that, in accordance with those regulations, might have
undermined said independence.

We consider that the audit evidence obtained provides a sufficient and appropriate basis for our
opinion.

**Key audit matters**

Key audit matters are those that, based on our professional judgement, have been of the most
significance in the audit of the consolidated annual accounts for the current period. These matters
have been addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated annual accounts as a whole and
in the preparation of our opinion thereon, and we do not express a separate opinion on these matters.

**Key audit matters** **How the matter was addressed in the audit**

Recoverability of assets associated with the
hotel business.


The Group operates 368 hotels under leases
or owned. The assets associated with the
hotel business include goodwill, right-of-use
assets, property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets, the carrying amounts of
which amount to €107 million, €1,702 million,
€1,713 million and €84 million, respectively, at
31 December 2019, representing 82% of all
assets.

The Group assesses the assets for signs of
impairment each year to determine whether
there are any impairment losses entailing the
write-down of the carrying amounts of the
assets, calculated as described in Notes 4.2
and 4.4 to the consolidated annual accounts.

As a general rule, Group management
estimates the recoverable amount of each
cash-generating unit (CGU) on the basis of
value in use, calculated using cash flows
estimated by applying discount rates and
expected growth rates, in accordance with the
business plans approved by management.

As recognised in the consolidated profit and
loss statement, the Group has
recorded under " Net Profit /(Losses) from
asset impairment" a net positive effect of
impairment and reversal of impairment on
the aforementioned assets amounting
of €4,889 thousand.

In view of the significance of the judgements
made by the Group and the significant
estimates made to perform the said
calculations, and considering the quantitative
relevance of the assets, we believe the
assessment of the recoverability of the assets
associated with the hotel business to be a key
audit matter.


Our audit procedures have included, among
others:

Understanding of the methodology employed and
evaluation of the controls in place in the Group's
asset recovery analysis processes.

Obtainment from management of the impairment
test carried out, to which we have applied the
following substantive procedures, assisted by our
internal experts:

- Verification of the reasonableness of the
procedures and methods used to perform
the impairment test.

- Assessment of the reasonableness of the

key assumptions and estimates included in
the model in relation both to future cash
flow forecasts and the key aspects included
in the estimation of the cash flows, such as
the method applied by management to
estimate the discount rates within an
acceptable range.

- Analysis of departures between the cash
flow projections prepared by management
in the past and actual data.

- Arithmetic verification of the calculations
taken into consideration in the impairment
test and assessment of the sensitivity
analyses, including the ranges within which
the key model assumptions should fluctuate
in order to give rise to the impairment of
assets or the reversal of existing provisions.

- Evaluation of the sufficiency of the related
information disclosed in the consolidated
annual accounts.

The findings of the procedures carried out have
allowed us to achieve the audit objectives for
which the procedures were designed.

**Key audit matters** **How the matter was addressed in the audit**

Adoption of IFRS 16 - Leases


The Group has adopted IFRS 16 – Leases,
with effect on 1 January 2019, for all contracts
that were identified as leases pursuant to IAS
17 and IFRIC 4, barring the exemptions
recognised by the standard.

As stated in Note 2.1.1 to the accompanying
annual accounts, IFRS 16 lays down the
principles for recognising, measuring,
presenting and disclosing leases. The
standard stipulates that a liability must be
recognised at lease inception equal to the
present value of the lease instalments. The
liability will include fixed instalments and
those that are in substance fixed instalments,
as well as variable instalments depending on
an index or interest rate. In turn, an asset will
be recognised representing the right of use of
the underlying asset during the lease term.

The Group has applied the modified
retrospective approach, entailing the
recognition at the adoption date, as indicated
in Note 2.1.1, of right-of-use assets
amounting to €1,747 million and a lease
liability of €2,099 million.

Group management has taken the necessary
steps to correctly adopt the standard, which
include analysing all the contracts affected by
IFRS 16, studying the specific implications of
each contract type to which it is applicable,
determining lease terms, estimating discount
rates and adapting systems to correctly
recognise the first-time adoption of the
standard in the accounts.

The implementation of the new standard has
had considerable accounting impacts on the
Group as regards the total value of its assets
and liabilities, there being numerous contracts
containing non-homogeneous clauses. The
risk of material misstatement as a result of
any incident in this first-time adoption
process, together with the assessment of
management's judgements and
interpretations as regards the terms of the
leases and the estimation of discount rates,
have led us to consider our work on the firsttime adoption of IFRS 16 16 – Leases to be a
key audit matter.


Our audit procedures relating to the adoption of

IFRS 16 – Leases include the following:

- Understanding and assessment of the
accounting policies applied by management
to adopt the standard as from 1 January
2019.

- Assessment of the operating effectiveness
of the key controls associated with the
calculation of the accounting effects of
adopting the standard.

- Testing of the completeness of information,
checking the inclusion in the computer
system of all the contracts to which the
standard is applicable.

- Evaluation of the estimates and
assumptions considered by the Group to
estimate the discount rates used for the
leases deemed to be affected by the
adoption of the standard.

- Performance of tests of detail on the
information relating to the leases recorded
in the systems, checking, based on a
sample of leases, their existence, the
correct determination of lease terms and
the amount, in accordance with applicable
accounting requirements.

- Assessment of the sufficiency of the
information disclosed in the consolidated
annual accounts in relation to the first-time
adoption of IFRS 16.

The findings of the procedures carried out have
allowed us to achieve the audit objectives for
which the procedures were designed.

**Other matters**

The consolidated annual accounts of NH Hotel Group, S.A. and subsidiaries for the financial year
ended 31 December 2018 were audited by a different auditor, which issued a favourable opinion on
those consolidated annual accounts on 25 February 2019.

**Other information: Consolidated management report**

The other information only relates to the consolidated management report for 2019, the preparation of
which is the responsibility of the parent company’s directors and which does not form an integral part
of the consolidated annual accounts.

Our audit opinion on the consolidated annual accounts does not cover the consolidated management
report. Our responsibility for the information contained in this consolidated management report is
defined in auditing legislation, which establishes two distinct levels:

a) A specific level applicable to the status of consolidated non-financial information and to certain
information included in the Annual Corporate Governance Report (ACGR), as defined in Article
35.2. b) of Audit Law 22/2015, which consists of merely verifying that the said information has
been furnished in the management report or, if applicable, that the report includes the relevant
reference to the separate report on non-financial information in the manner stipulated in
legislation. Otherwise, we are required to report on this matter.

b) A general level applicable to the other information included in the consolidated management
report, which consists of assessing and reporting on the consistency of the said information with
the consolidated annual accounts, based on our knowledge of the Group obtained during the
audit of the accounts, without including information other than the audit evidence obtained, as
well as evaluating and reporting on whether the content and presentation of this part of the
consolidated management report are in line with applicable legislation. If we conclude that there
are material misstatements on the basis of our work, we are required to report them.

On the basis of the work performed, as described above, we have verified that the information
mentioned in paragraph a) above is presented in the separate report, “Non-Financial Information
Consolidated Statement 2019”, to which the consolidated management report refers, that the ACGR
information, mentioned in the said paragraph, is included in the consolidated management report and
that the other information contained in the consolidated management report is consistent with that of
the consolidated annual accounts for 2019 and its content and presentation comply with application
legalisation.

**Responsibility of the directors and the Audit and Control Committee in relation to the**
**consolidated annual accounts**

The directors of the parent company are responsible for the preparation of the accompanying
consolidated annual accounts such that they present fairly the Group’s consolidated equity, financial
situation and results in accordance with IFRS-EU and other provisions of the financial reporting
framework applicable to the Group in Spain, and for the internal control which they consider necessary
to enable the preparation of annual accounts free from material misstatements, due to fraud or error.

In the preparation of the consolidated annual accounts, the parent company’s directors are
responsible for assessing the Group’s capacity to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as
appropriate, any going concern-related issues and applying the going-concern accounting principle,
unless the directors intend to wind up the Group or discontinue its operations, or unless no other
realistic alternative exists.


-----

The parent company's Audit and Control Committee is responsible for overseeing the preparation and
presentation of the consolidated annual accounts.

**Auditors’ responsibilities in relation to the audit of the consolidated annual accounts**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance that the consolidated annual accounts as a whole
are free from material misstatement due to fraud or error, and to issue an audit report containing our
opinion.

Reasonable assurance is a high degree of assurance but does not guarantee that an audit conducted
in accordance with current Spanish auditing regulations will always detect a material misstatement
when such exists. Misstatements may be due to fraud or error and are regarded as material if,
individually or in aggregate, it may reasonably be foreseen that they will influence the business
decisions taken by users on the basis of the consolidated annual accounts.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with prevailing Spanish audit regulations, we apply our
professional judgement and maintain an attitude of professional scepticism throughout the audit. In
addition:

- We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated annual accounts
due to fraud or error; we design and apply audit procedures to respond to those risks and obtain
sufficient and adequate audit evidence to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting material misstatement due to fraud is higher than in the case of a material
misstatement due to error, as fraud may involve collusion, falsification, deliberate omissions,
intentionally erroneous statements or the circumvention of internal control.

- We obtain knowledge of internal control mechanisms relevant for the audit in order to design the
audit procedures which are appropriate depending on the circumstances, and not with the
intention of expressing an opinion on the efficiency of the Group's internal control system.

- We assess whether the accounting policies applied are adequate and the reasonableness of the
accounting estimates and the relevant information disclosed by the parent company’s directors.

- We conclude as to whether the utilisation by the parent company's directors of the going
concern principle is appropriate and, basing ourselves on the audit evidence obtained, we
conclude as to whether there is or not any material uncertainty in relation to the events or
conditions that could generate significant doubts as to the Group’s capacity to continue as a
going concern. If we conclude that material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention
in our audit report to the corresponding information disclosed in the consolidated annual
accounts or, if those disclosures are unsuitable, to express a modified opinion. Our conclusions
are based on audit evidence obtained up to the date of our audit report. However, future events
or conditions could cause the Group to cease to be a going concern.

- We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated annual
accounts, including the disclosed information, and whether the consolidated annual accounts
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that succeeds in expressing a
true and fair view.

- We obtain sufficient, adequate evidence relating to the financial information of the Group’s
entities or business activities to express an opinion on the consolidated annual accounts. We
are responsible for managing, overseeing and performing the audit of the Group. We are solely
responsible for our audit opinion.


-----

We liaise with the parent company’s Audit and Control Committee in relation to, among other matters,
the planned scope and timing of the audit and the significant audit findings, as well as any major
internal control weakness that we identify in the course of our audit.

We also provide the parent company’s Audit and Control Committee with a statement to the effect that
we have complied with applicable ethical requirements, including those of independence, and we have
notified the Audit Committee of any issues that could reasonably pose a threat to our independence
and, if appropriate, the relevant safeguards.

Among the significant risks notified to the parent company's Audit and Control Committee, we
determine those that have been of the greatest significance in the audit of the consolidated annual
accounts for the current period and which therefore are key audit matters.

We describe these matters in our audit report unless legal or regulatory provisions prohibit the public
disclosure of the matter concerned.

###### NH HOTEL GROUP, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES REPORT ON THE
 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR 2019


**1.-** **ACTIVITY AND COMPOSITION OF THE PARENT COMPANY**

NH HOTEL GROUP, S.A. (hereinafter the Parent Company) was incorporated as a public limited company in
Spain on 23 December 1981 under the trade name “Material para Ferrocarriles y Construcciones, S.A.”, which
was subsequently changed to “Material y Construcciones, S.A.” (MACOSA) and later to “Corporación Arco,
S.A.”

In 1992, Corporación Arco, S.A. took over Corporación Financiera Reunida, S.A. (COFIR), while at the same
time adopting the trade name of the company taken over and amending its corporate purpose to the new activity
of the Parent Company, which focused on the management of its shareholding portfolio.

During 1998, Corporación Financiera Reunida, S.A. (COFIR) merged with Grupo Catalán, S.L. and its
subsidiaries and Gestión NH, S.A. through the absorption of these companies by the former. Subsequently,
Corporación Financiera Reunida, S.A. (COFIR) took over NH Hoteles, S.A., adopted its trade name and
broadened its corporate purpose to allow for the direct performance of hotel activities, activities in which it had
already been engaged indirectly through its subsidiaries.

Information on these mergers can be found in the financial statements of the years in which said transactions took
place.

The General Shareholders' Meeting of 21 June 2014 agreed to change the company's name from “NH Hoteles,
S.A.” to “NH Hotel Group, S.A.”

The Parent Company is the head of a group of subsidiaries engaged in the same activities and that constitute,
together with NH Hotel Group, S.A., the NH Hotels Group (hereinafter the “Group” – see Appendices I and II).

At the end of 2019, the Group was operating hotels in 30 countries, with 368 hotels and 57,466 rooms, of which
around 70% are located in Spain, Germany, Italy and the Benelux countries.

NH Hotel Group, S.A. has its registered address in Madrid.

**2.-** **BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND**

**CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES**

**2.1** **Basis of presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

The consolidated financial statements for 2019 were drawn up by the directors of NH Hotel Group, S.A. at the
Board meeting held on 25 February 2020, in accordance with the regulatory reporting framework applicable to
the Group, as established in the Code of Commerce and all other Spanish corporate law, and in the International
Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") adopted by the European Union in accordance with Regulation (EC) No.
1606/2002 of the European Parliament and in Law 62/2003, of 30 December, the Tax, Administrative, Labour
and Social Security Measures Act as well as in the applicable standards and circulars of the National Securities
Market Commission and the remaining Spanish accounting standards which may be applicable, and as such give
a true and fair presentation the Group’s equity and financial position at 31 December 2019 and of the results of
its operations, changes in equity and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended.

The consolidated financial statements for 2019 of the Group and the entities that it comprises have not yet been
approved by the shareholders at the respective Annual General Meetings or by the respective shareholders or sole
shareholders. Nonetheless, the directors of the Parent Company believe that said financial statements will be
approved without any significant changes. The consolidated financial statements for 2018 were approved by the
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 13 May 2019 and filed with the Companies Registry of
Madrid.

Since the accounting standards and valuation criteria applied in the preparation of the Group’s consolidated
financial statements for 2019 may differ from those used by some of its component companies, the necessary
adjustments and reclassifications have been made to standardise them and adapt them to the IFRS adopted by the
European Union.

**2.1.1** **Standards and interpretations effective in this period**

In 2019 new accounting standards came into force and were therefore taken into account when preparing the
accompanying consolidated financial statements, but which did not give rise to a change in the Group’s
accounting policies:

The main change hinges on the fact that the new standard proposes a single accounting model for lessees who will include all leases (with some exceptions) on the balance sheet with a similar impact to that of the current financial leases (the asset will depreciate due to the right of use and a financial expense for the cost of amortising the liability).|01 January 2019|

These regulations and amendments have been applied to these consolidated financial statements with no
significant impacts on either the reported figures or the presentation and breakdown of the information, except
for the application of IFRS 16; see breakdown of impacts in the following section:

**(2)** **Analysis of IFRS 16 first application.**

IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17, IFRIC 4, SIC-15 and SIC-17 and establishes the principles for the recognition,
measurement, presentation and disaggregation of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a
balance sheet recognition model similar to the accounting for finance leases under IAS 17. IFRS 16 came into
force on 1 January 2019 and the Group decided not to apply it early.

The standard provides that at the inception of the lease, the lessee must record a liability equal to the present
value of the lease payments. Such a liability includes fixed lease payments and those that are substantially fixed,
as well as variable lease payments that depend on an index or interest rate. An asset that represents the right to
use the underlying asset during the lease term (the right of use) is recognised. In the case of Grupo NH, the right
of use is linked to “Buildings and Constructions”. Lessees are required to record separately the interest expense
of the lease liability from the amortisation expense of the right of use.

Lessees are also required to recalculate the lease liability in certain circumstances (for example, a change in the
term of the lease or a change in lease payments due to a change in the index or rate used to determine those
payments). The lessee shall recognise the difference from the recalculation of the liability as an adjustment to
the value of the right of use.

The lessor's accounting under IFRS 16 is substantially the same as under IAS 17. The lessor shall continue to
classify leases using the same criteria as under IAS 17 and distinguish between operating and finance leases.


-----

**Transition to IFRS 16**

The Group has begun applying the standard to all contracts that were identified as leases in accordance with IAS
17 and IFRIC 4, except for the exceptions recognised by the standard. These exceptions are as follows: leases of
low-value assets (e.g. computers) and short-term leases (leases for periods of less than 12 months). Also, the
Group analysed the subleases signed at the transition date and, due to their amount and the applicable market
conditions, were not considered relevant for the application of the standard.

The Group decided to apply the modified retrospective method as the transition method to IFRS 16, calculating
the asset at the commencement date of each identified contract and the liability at the transition date, using for
the calculation of both the incremental interest rate at the transition date and recognising the difference between
the two items as an adjustment to the opening balance of the consolidated reserves.

In order to determine the term of the lease contracts, the Group has taken as non-cancellable the initial term of
each contract, taking the possible unilateral extensions at the option of the Group only in those cases in which it
has been reasonably considered certain that they will be exercised, and only the cancellation options whose
exercise has been reasonably considered certain have been taken into account.

The incremental interest rate is the interest rate that the lessee would incur at the commencement of the lease if
it borrowed, over a period of time, with similar guarantees and in a similar economic environment. The interest
was calculated as a combination of the following elements:

  - CDS curve of the economic environment

  - Euribor Swap Rate Curve.

  - Synthetic NH CDS curve.

These elements were combined to obtain an interest rate curve for each contract based on its geoeconomic
specificities and from which the calculation process consists of bringing each of the discounted flows to the
present value at the interest rate corresponding to each maturity within said curve and calculating which single
equivalent rate would be used to discount said flows. The simple average rate of all the Group’s leasing contracts
affected by IFRS 16 is 4.3%

The impact of IFRS 16 on the Group's financial statements is significant due to the lease contracts portfolio.

This impact at 1 January 2019 was mainly greater right-of-use net assets for 1.747 billion euros, a greater liability
for operating leases of 2.099 billion euros (1.839 billion euros of non-current liabilities and 260 million euros of
current liabilities), lower early payments assets of 3 million euros, lower lease linearisation assets of 16 million
euros (13 million euros in non-current assets, 3 million euros in current assets), lower lease linearisation liabilities
of 19 million euros (17 million euros in other non-current liabilities, 2 million euros in other current liabilities),
greater deferred tax assets of 88 million euros and lower equity of 256 million euros. It also entailed the
reclassification of certain balance sheet items that were associated with lease contracts under the Right-of-use
assets heading. Specifically, a liability for risk provisions and expenses on onerous contracts of 7 million euros,
a liability for grants of 22 million euros and net intangible assets of 22 million euros.

The calculation of these impacts has been performed as if IFRS 16 had been applied from the inception of each
contract or from the date of initial consolidation of the lessee of the contract. The calculation was made by
discounting the lease flows by recalculating the asset and liability for each material modification to the lease and
using an incremental interest rate calculated for each of the contracts at the transition date without taking into
account the tax effect.

In order to reconcile operating lease commitments at 31 December 2018 in accordance with IAS 17 (see Note
24.5 of the 2018 consolidated annual accounts) with operating lease liabilities in accordance with IFRS 16, it
would be necessary to add the commitments discounted by operating leases in accordance with IAS 17 of
approximately 2 billion euros (3.581 billion euros of pre-discounted nominal value commitments), the impact of
applying different discount rates (approximately 274 million euros, and subtract the impact of contracts signed
but not in force at the transition date (approximately -175 million euros), thereby achieving an operating lease


-----

liability of 2.099 billion euros (1.839 billion euros of non-current liabilities and 260 million euros of current
liabilities).

The main impacts on the Group’s consolidation, according to the source of the contracts in the hotel sector
distributed by geographical segment of IFRS 16 at 31 December 2019 are as follows (thousands of euros):

**2.2** **Accounting correction**

During the first quarter of 2019, a situation was detected in the Consolidated Annual Accounts at 31 December
2018 in relation to the accounting for hyperinflation in the Argentine subsidiaries of the Parent Company in
accordance with IAS 29.

This situation corresponded to the recording of a higher consolidated result in 2018 derived from hyperinflation
in Argentine subsidiaries, when a net amount of 19 million euros before minority interests should have been
recorded directly in reserves. This therefore supposes a reclassification between the result and equity without
there being any additional impact to consider.

Following a report from the Audit and Control Committee, the Board of Directors considered that the situation
revealed did not represent a very significant impact on the Consolidated Annual Accounts at 31 December 2018
in the context of Article 38 of the Commercial Code as it did not affect the financial or equity position of the
Company, and did not justify, therefore, the consolidated annual accounts be restated.

Based on the foregoing, the aforementioned reclassification has been recorded in equity balances at 1 January
2018, which has resulted in higher consolidated reserves of 16,212 thousand euros and a lower consolidated
result for the same amount. On the other hand, the effect of the reclassification on minority interests was 3,177
thousand euros as higher reserves and the same amount as lower gain/(loss) and supposes zero effect on this
heading of the abridged consolidated statement of changes in net equity (See Note 15.4).

**2.3** **Accounting criteria change**

The impact recorded on the Statement of Changes in Equity in relation to the change in accounting criteria heading
is mainly due to the provision for the pension plan on certain contract allocated in one country where a more
prudent interpretation deriving a gross impact of 12,191 thousand euros, giving rise to an impact net of tax of less
net equity amounting to 9,692 thousand euros. This impact has been recognised at 1 January 2019. (see Note 18)

**2.4** **Comparison of information**

As required by IAS 1, the information on 2018 contained in this consolidated annual report is presented for solely
comparative purposes with the information on 2019 and consequently does not in itself constitute the Group’s
consolidated financial statements for 2018.


-----

**First application of IFRS 16**

As a result of applying IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019, there are certain items in the consolidated financial
statements at 31 December 2019 that are not comparable with the previous year (see Note 2.1.1).

**Conversion of NH Argentina’s financial statements**

During 2018, the economic crisis in Argentina worsened considerably, and this situation has led to a substantial
increase in the rate of inflation and has surpassed 100% in the last three years. These events led Argentina to be
considered a hyperinflationary economy from the third quarter 2018 onwards, in accordance with accounting
standards. As a result, the Group applied IAS 29 "Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies" to the
Group's business in Argentina in the third quarter of 2018 in accordance with accounting standards.

Given Argentina's consideration as a hyperinflationary country, the financial statements are adjusted for inflation
(see Note 4.23), the most significant impact being the restatement of non-current assets and liabilities from the
date of acquisition, last revaluation or first application of IFRS by the inflation index. The difference between the
pre-tax result and the net result corresponds to the recognition of deferred tax (see Note 18) for the adjustments
for inflation of net assets that, according to current tax legislation in Argentina, are not tax deductible.

The first application of IAS 29 from 1 January 2018 led to an increase of 46 million euros in consolidated reserves
and an increase in the value of minority interests of 7 million euros, recorded mainly under "Property, Plant and
Equipment" (an increase of 71 million euros in net book value upon first application, see Note 8) and under
deferred tax liabilities (an increase of 18 million euros in the value of liabilities at the time of first application,
see Note 19).

Additionally, the Group decided to classify the historical translation differences associated with the devaluation
of the currency in Argentina to consolidated reserves. This had a negative effect on the consolidated reserves of
96,862 thousand euros and, therefore, the total effect of hyperinflation at the time of first-time application
amounted to lower reserves in fully consolidated companies amounting to 50,724 thousand euros.

After this first application, the impact of the application of IAS 29 during 2018 had a negative net effect on the
reserves of consolidated companies amounting to 27 million euros. This is composed of the effect of the
devaluation of the currency that compensates for the increase in equity because of the restatement of nonmonetary items due to hyperinflation. On the other hand, "Property, plant and equipment" increased by 1.8 million
euros (see Note 8), and the deferred tax liability increased by 1.2 million euros (see Note 19) with respect to the
first application at 1 January 2018. Also, the net effect in the profit and loss account of the application of IAS 29
is recorded as income of 635 thousand euros, under the heading “Results from exposure to hyperinflation” (IAS
29) in the 2018 consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement.

The main impacts from applying IAS 29 in 2019 have had a positive effect on equity of 1.9 million euros, an
increase in property, plant and equipment of 1.5 million euros, a decrease in deferred tax liabilities of 1.2 million
euros (see Note 19) and an expense of 85 thousand euros under the heading “Results from exposure to
hyperinflation” (IAS 29) of the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss.


-----

**2.5** **Currency of presentation**

These consolidated financial statements are presented in euros. Any foreign currency transactions have been
recognised in accordance with the criteria described in Note 4.9.

**2.6** **Going concern**

The application of the new accounting standard IFRS 16 (see Note 2.1.1) has led to, among others, a liability
being recognised in the short term corresponding to the current value of the lease payment commitments to be
made in the next twelve months that, at 31 December 2019, amounted to 252,970 thousand euros resulting in
current liabilities being 93.6 million euros higher than current assets at that date. Given that this effect is caused
by a purely accounting (non-financial) approach, this does not prevent the business's normal development.

**2.7** **Responsibility for the information, estimates made and sources of uncertainty**

The Directors of the Parent Company are responsible for the information contained in these consolidated financial
statements.

Estimates made by the management of the Group and of the consolidated entities have been used in preparing the
Group’s consolidated financial statements to quantify some of the assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and
undertakings recognised. These estimates essentially refer to:

        - The assessment of possible impairment losses on certain assets.

        - The hypotheses used in the actuarial calculation of liabilities for pensions and other
undertakings made to the workforce;

        - The useful life of the tangible and intangible assets.

        - The valuation of consolidation goodwill.

        - The market value of specific assets.

        - Calculation of provisions and evaluation of contingencies.

        - The recoverability of capitalised tax credits.

In spite of the fact that these estimates were carried out using the best information available at 31 December 2019
on events analysed, it is possible that events may take place in the future which compel their amendment (upwards
or downwards) in years to come. This will be done in accordance with the provisions of IAS 8, prospectively
recognising the effects of the change in estimate on the consolidated profit and loss statement.

**2.8** **Consolidation principles applied**

**_2.8.1 Subsidiaries (See Appendix I)_**

Subsidiaries are considered as any company included within the scope of consolidation in which the Parent
Company directly or indirectly controls their management due to holding the majority of voting rights in the
governance and decision-making body, with the ability to exercise control. This ability is shown when the Parent
Company has the power to direct an investee entity’s financial and operating policy in order to obtain profits from
its activities.

The financial statements of subsidiaries are consolidated with those of the Parent Company by applying the full
consolidation method. Consequently, all significant balances and effects of any transactions taking place between
them have been eliminated in the consolidation process. If necessary, adjustments are made to the financial
statements of the subsidiaries to adapt the accounting policies used to those used by the Group.

Stakes held by non-controlling shareholders in the Group’s equity and results are respectively presented in the
“Non-controlling interests” item of the consolidated balance sheet and of the consolidated comprehensive profit
and loss statement.


-----

The profit or loss of any subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the financial year are included in the
consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement from the effective date of acquisition or until to the effective
date of disposal, as appropriate.

**_2.8.2 Associates (See Appendix II)_**

Associates are considered as any companies in which the Parent Company has the ability to exercise significant
influence, though it does not exercise either control or joint control. In general terms, it is assumed that significant
influence exists when the percentage stake (direct or indirect) held by the Group exceeds 20% of the voting rights,
as long as it does not exceed 50%.

Associates are valued in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method; in other words, through
the fraction of their net equity value the Group’s stake in their capital represents once any dividends received and
other equity retirements have been considered. In the case of transactions with an associated company, the
corresponding losses or gains are eliminated in the percentage of the Group's stake in its capital.

The profit (loss) net of tax of the associate companies is included in the Group’s consolidated comprehensive
profit and loss statement, in the item "Profit (Loss) from entities valued through the equity method", according to
the percentage of the Group's stake.

If, as a result of the losses incurred by an associate company, its equity were negative, in the Group's consolidated
balance sheet it would be nil; unless there were an obligation on the part of the Group to support it financially.

**_2.8.3 Foreign currency translation_**

The following criteria have been different applied for converting into euros the different items of the consolidated
balance sheet and the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement of foreign companies included within
the scope of consolidation:

  - Assets and liabilities have been converted by applying the effective exchange rate prevailing at yearend.

  - Equity has been converted by applying the historical exchange rate. The historical exchange rate existing
at 31 December 2003 of any companies included within the scope of consolidation prior to the
transitional date has been considered as the historical exchange rate.

  - The consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement was translated at the average exchange rate
for the year, except for the companies in Argentina whose economy was declared hyperinflationary in
2018 and therefore, in accordance with IAS 29, their consolidated comprehensive profit and loss
statement was translated at the 2019 year-end exchange rate (see Note 4.23).

Any difference resulting from the application these criteria have been included in the “Translation differences”
item under the “Equity” heading (except for those arising from the translation of hyperinflationary economies).

Any adjustments arising from the application of IFRS at the time of acquisition of a foreign company with regard
to market value and goodwill are considered as assets and liabilities of such company and are therefore converted
using the exchange rate prevailing at year-end.

**_2.8.4 Changes in the scope of consolidation_**

The most significant changes in the scope of consolidation during 2019 and 2018 that affect the comparison
between financial years were the following:


-----

**a.1** **Changes in the scope of consolidation in 2019**

**a.1.1 Additions to the scope of consolidation**

In October, the Group formed the company Anantara The Marker Ltd to acquire the company GCS Hotel Limited,
operator of The Marker hotel in Dublin. The acquisition cost was 13,652 thousand euros and the inclusion of
these companies has had the following effects on the consolidated balance sheet:

Thousands

Item of euros

Property, plant and equipment (See Note 8) 4,032

Usage Rights (See Note 9) 9,428

Current assets 2,257

Current liabilities (2,065)

**Fair value of the acquired entity's net assets** **13,652**

**Net Consideration** **(13,652)**

The entry of this company has not had a significant effect on the consolidated comprehensive income statements
at 31 December 2019. Likewise, the impact for the full year would not have a significant effect on the consolidated
comprehensive income statements at 31 December 2019.

**a.1.2 Disposals**

In January 2019, the Group sold the 49% shareholding it held in Beijing NH Grand China Hotel Management Co,
Ltd. This sale has resulted in a cash inflow of 1.9 million euros and has not had a significant impact on profits for
the year (See Note 10).

**a.2** **Changes in the scope of consolidation in 2018**

**a.2.1 Additions to the scope of consolidation**

During 2018, there were no additions to the scope of consolidation.

**a.2.2 Disposals**

In the first half of 2018, the Group liquidated Hotel&Congress Technology, S.L. and Hoteleira Brasil LTDA, in
which it held 50% and 100% of equity, respectively. The net result of these liquidations produced a consolidated
negative result of 40 and 45 thousand euros respectively.

In addition, in May 2018, the company belonging to the consolidated group Fast Good Islas Canarias, S.L. was
liquidated. This liquidation had no impact on consolidated profit for the year.

**_2.8.5 Intra-group eliminations_**

All accounts receivable and accounts payable, and transactions performed between subsidiaries, with associate
companies and joint ventures, and among each other, have been eliminated in the consolidation process.

**_2.8.6 Valuation uniformity_**

The consolidation of the entities included in the scope of consolidation has been performed based on their
individual financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with the Spanish General Accounting Plan for
companies resident in Spain and in accordance with their own local regulations for foreign companies. All
significant adjustments necessary to adapt them to International Financial Reporting Standards and/or
homogenise them with the accounting principles of the parent company have been considered in the consolidation
process.

-----

**3.-** **PROPOSED DISTRIBUTION OF PROFITS**

The proposed distribution of the profit (loss) for the year prepared by the Parent Company's Directors and that
will be submitted for approval by the Shareholders at the General Shareholders' Meeting is as follows (in
thousands of euros):

2019

To legal reserve 15.894

To distribution of dividends 58.771

To voluntary reserves 84.275

**Total** **158.940**

**4.** **VALUATION STANDARDS**

The main principles, accounting policies and valuation standards applied by the Group to draw up these
consolidated financial statements, which comply with IFRS in force on the date of the relevant financial
statements, have been the following:

**4.1** **Tangible fixed assets**

Tangible fixed assets are valued at their original cost. They are subsequently valued at their reduced cost resulting
from cumulative depreciation and, as appropriate, from any impairment losses they may have suffered.

Due to the transition to IFRS, the Group reappraised the value of some land to its market value on the basis of
appraisals made by an independent expert for a total amount of 217 million euros. The reappraised cost of such
land was considered as a cost attributed to the transition to the IFRS. The Group followed the criterion of not revaluing any of its tangible fixed assets at subsequent year-ends.

Enlargement, modernisation and improvement costs entailing an increase in productivity, capacity or efficiency
or a lengthening of the assets’ useful life are recognised as increases in the cost of such assets. Conservation and
maintenance costs are charged against the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement for the year in
which they are incurred.

Withdrawn assets and items, whether arising as a result of a modernisation process or due to any other cause, are
accounted for by derecognising the balances presented in the corresponding cost and accumulated depreciation
accounts.

The Group depreciates its property, plant and equipment following the straight line method, distributing the cost
of the assets over their estimated useful lives, in accordance with the following table:

Estimated years of useful

life

Buildings 33-50

Plant and machinery 10-30

Other plant, fixtures and furniture 5-10

Other fixed assets 4-5

These items are depreciated based on their estimated useful life or the remaining term of the lease, if this is less
than the useful life.

|Col1|2019|
|---|---|
|To legal reserve To distribution of dividends To voluntary reserves|15.894 58.771 84.275|
|Total|158.940|


-----

The profit or loss resulting from the disposal or withdrawal of an asset is calculated as the difference between the
profit from the sale and the asset's book value, and is recognised in the consolidated comprehensive profit and
loss statement.

**4.2** **Consolidation goodwill**

The goodwill generated on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's share
in the market value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary.

Any positive differences between the cost of interests in the capital of consolidated and associated entities and
the corresponding theoretical carrying amounts acquired, adjusted on the date of the first consolidation, are
recognised as follows:

1. If they are assignable to specific equity elements of the companies acquired, by increasing the value of
any assets the market value of which is above their carrying amount appearing in the balance statements.

2. If they are assignable to specific intangible assets, by explicitly recognising them in the consolidated
balance sheet, provided their market value on the date of acquisition can be reliably determined.

3. Any remaining differences are recognised as goodwill, which is assigned to one or more specific cashgenerating units (in general hotels) which are expected to make a profit.

Goodwill is recognised only when it has been acquired for valuable consideration and represents, therefore,
advance payments made by the acquirer of the future economic benefits derived from the assets of the acquired
entity that are not individually and separately identifiable and recognisable.

Any goodwill generated through acquisitions prior to the IFRS transition date, 1 January 2004, is kept at its net
value recognised at 31 December 2003 in accordance with Spanish accounting standards.

At the time of the disposal of a subsidiary or jointly controlled entity, the amount attributable to the goodwill is
included when determining the profits or losses arising from the disposal.

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of companies with a functional currency other than the euro is valued in the
functional currency of the acquired company, with the conversion to euros being made at the exchange rate
prevailing at the balance sheet date.

Goodwill is not amortised. In this regard, at the end of every year, or whenever there are indications of a loss of
value, the Group estimates, using the so-called “Impairment Test”, the possible existence of permanent losses of
value that would reduce the recoverable amount of goodwill to less than the net cost recognised. Should this be
the case, it is written down in the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement. Any write-downs
recognised cannot subsequently be reversed.

All goodwill is assigned to one or more cash-generating units in order to conduct the impairment test. The
recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit is determined as the higher of the value in use and the fair value
less sale costs.

The value in use is considered as the current value of expected future cash flows discounted at an after‐tax rate
that reflects the current market valuation with respect to the cost of money and the specific risks associated with
the asset.

**4.3** **Intangible assets**

Intangible assets are considered to be any specifically identifiable non-monetary assets which have been acquired
from third parties or developed by the Group. Only those whose cost can be estimated in an objective way and
from which future economic profits are expected are recognised.


-----

Intangible assets are initially recognised at acquisition or production cost and are subsequently measured at cost
less, as appropriate, their accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses they have suffered.

Any assets deemed to contribute indefinitely to the generation of profits are considered to have an indefinite
useful life. The remaining intangible assets are considered have a “finite useful life”.

Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised and are hence subjected to the “impairment test”
at least once a year (see Note 4.4).

Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortised according to the straight-line method on the basis of the
estimated years of useful life of the asset in question.

The following are the main items recognised under the “Intangible assets” heading:

i) “Concessions, patents and trademarks” basically reflect the disbursements made by Gran Círculo
de Madrid, S.A. for the refurbishment and remodelling of the building where the Casino de Madrid
is located. The amortisation of such works is calculated on a straight-line basis by taking into
account the term of the concession for operating and managing the services provided in the building
where the Casino de Madrid is located, which finalises on 1 January 2037. Furthermore, this item
includes the brands of the Grupo Royal with a useful life of 20 years.

ii) “Computer applications” include the costs incurred by the Group Companies in the acquisition and
development of various computer software programmes acquired by the different consolidated
companies. The amortisation of software applications is performed using the straight-line method at
a rate of 20-25% per year.

iii) On the other hand, as a consequence of entering into the consolidation of Hoteles Royal, S.A.,
operating rights of the hotel portfolio for 35 years were recognised within this concept.

**4.4** **Impairment in the value of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill**

The Group evaluates the possible existence of a loss of value each year that would oblige it to reduce the carrying
amounts of its tangible and intangible assets. A loss is deemed to exist when the recoverable value is less than the
carrying amount.

The recoverable amount is determined as the value in use, with the sole exception of two cases, not significant in
the context of the assets as a whole, in which the valuation of an independent third party was used as the
recoverable amount. The value in use is calculated from the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a discount
rate after tax that reflects the current market valuation with respect to the value of money and the specific risks
associated with the asset, covering a five-year period and a perpetual value, except in the case of leased hotels
that correspond to the lease period, a perpetual value therefore not being considered in the latter.

As a general rule, the Group has defined each of the hotels it operates as cash-generating units, according to the
real management of their operations.

In the case of Hoteles Royal, S.A., where the whole business of Grupo Royal was acquired and whose purchase
was effective in 2015, the cash-generating unit corresponds to the Group as a whole (Colombian, Chilean and
Ecuadorian market).

For each CGU (hotel or Royal Group) the operating result is obtained at the end of the year without taking into
account non-recurring results (if any) or financial results.

Once the operating result is obtained for each CGU, the impairment test is performed for those in which there are
indications of impairment. Among others, the Group considers that a CGU has indications of impairment if it
meets the following conditions: it has negative operating results and its business is stable (that is to say, they are
not recently opened hotels until, generally speaking, they have been open for 3 years).


-----

In addition, for all those CGUs in which impairment was recognised in previous years, an individual analysis and,
therefore, an impairment test is performed for them.

Future cash flows are estimated based on the result for the year and the records of at least five previous years.
The first projected year corresponds to the budget prepared by Management for the year following the impairment
test. The projections for the following years are consistent with the macroeconomic information from external
information sources and the knowledge of the business by the Group's Operations Department.

There are a number of factors that are considered by the Group's Management to make the projections, which are:

      - Estimate of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth issued by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
in its report published in October of each year for the next five years.

      - Knowledge of the business/asset/local situation of the local Management of each Business Unit to
which each CGU belongs.

      - Historical results obtained by the CGUs.

      - Investments in repositioning the CGUs.

These factors are reflected in the cash flows through the following working hypotheses used to obtain the
projections:

      - Income from accommodation is projected as the product of the occupancy percentage, the average
daily rate (ADR) per room, and the total available rooms per year.

      - The other revenues are projected based on the average of the relationship between the revenue from
accommodation and those revenues.

      - Staff costs are calculated based on the average staff costs with a growth in the inflation index (CPI).

      - For its part, tax is calculated from the tax rates applicable in each country.

      - Direct expenses are directly associated with each of the revenues and are projected on the basis of an
average ratio, while undistributed expenses are projected based on the average ratio between these
and direct expenses.

For the calculation of the discount rate the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) methodology has been
applied: Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), as follows:

WACC=Ke*E/(E+D) + Kd*(1-T)*D/(E+D)

Where:

Ke: Cost of Equity
Kd: Cost of Financial Debt
E: Own Funds
D: Financial Debt
T: Tax Rate

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is used to estimate the cost of equity (ke).

The main variables used to calculate the discount rate are as follows:

 - Risk-free rate: using the average long-term interest rates of a 10-year bond over the last 12 months for
each country, in the local currency.

 - Market risk premium: defined as 6.8% (6.6% in 2018), based on market reports.

 - Beta or systematic risk: Used as outside sources of information, this information is gathered from
independent databases and concerns the ratio between the risk of companies and overall market risk. The
re-leveraged beta coefficient has been estimated on the basis of 72% de-leveraged betas (83% in 2018),
the debt structure of comparable companies (Debt / (Debt + Equity) of 35% (26% in 2018) and the
corresponding tax rate in each country.


-----

 - Market value of debt, amounting to 4.58% (4.11% in 2018).

 - Premium by size: based on recent expert reports.

The after-tax discount rates used by the Group for these purposes range in Europe from 5.5% to 8.2% (6.2% and
9.0% in 2018) and in Latin America from 9.4% to 14.6% (10.6% and 18.4% in 2018) without taking into account
Argentina, whose after-tax discount rate has been calculated taking into account its hyperinflationary economic
situation (see Note 4.23) and varies between 47.1% in 2020 and 23.5% in 2024, based on the estimate of inflation.
In this regard, the cash flows resulting from the impairment tests were also calculated after tax. In addition, the
book value to which the value-in-use is compared does not include any deferred tax liabilities which could be
associated with the assets.

Using a post-tax discount rate and post-tax cash flows is consistent with paragraph 51 of IAS 36, which states
that "estimated future cash flows will reflect assumptions that are consistent with the manner of determining the
discount rate". In addition, the result of the post-tax flows updated at a post-tax discount rate would obtain uniform
results with respect to the impairment test if a pre-tax rate were used and, therefore, the impairment and reversion
accounting records would be uniform.

Below are the pre-tax discount rates of the major countries:

**Discount rate before taxes:**

**Germany** **Netherlands** **Italy** **Spain**

2019 8.8% 7.4% 12.7% 9,3%

###### I I I I

2018 7.8% 8.2% 10.2% 11,0%

If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be lower than its carrying amount, the latter is reduced to the
recoverable amount by recognising the corresponding reduction through the consolidated comprehensive profit
and loss statement.

If an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the limit of the
original value at which such asset was recognised before the loss of value was recognised.

Information on impairment losses detected in the financial year appears in Notes 7 and 8 of this Consolidated
Annual Report.

The evolution of the key assumptions in hotels with indications of impairment in the major countries in local
currency was as follows:

**2019** I **2018** **2019** I **2018** **2019** I **2018** **2019** I **2018**

**Germany** **Netherlands** **Italy** **Spain**

Post-tax WACC 5.47% 6.22% 6.01% 6.93% 8.21% 8.42% 6.88% 8.15%

Growth rate 2.13% 2.56% 2.01% 2.14% 1.50% 1.71% 1.77% 1.90%

Average ADR 96.8 80.9 66.0 73.9 97.5 110.9 91.6 88.9

Occupancy rate 71.5% 70.1% 54.1% 61.8% 60.9% 72.8% 74.6% 72.7%

"Average Daily Rate" (ADR): is the quotient of total room revenue for a specific period divided by the rooms
sold in that specific period. This indicator is used to compare with companies in the sector the average prices per
room of the hotels.

Additionally, the Group has analysed the potential impairment in ROU without having identified an impairment
to record for this item.

-----

**4.5** **Leases**

Until financial year 2018, leases of fixed assets were classified as financial or operating leases. Since 1 January
2019, leases have been recognised as a right-of-use asset and the corresponding liability on the date the leased
asset is available for use by the group (See Note 2.1.1).

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially valued based on their present value. Leasing liabilities
include the net present value of the following leasing payments:

  - Fixed payments (including fixed payments in essence), less any lease incentive collectable.

  - Variable payments for leases that reply on an index or rate, initially valued according to the index or rate
on the start date.

  - Amounts expected to be paid by the group for residual value guarantees.

  - The price to exercise a purchase option if the group is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option.

  - Penalty payments terminating the lease if the term of the lease reflects the group exercising that option.

In order to determine the term of the lease contracts, the Group has taken as non-cancellable the initial term of
each contract, taking the possible unilateral extensions at the option of the Group only in those cases in which it
has been reasonably considered certain that they will be exercised, and only the cancellation options whose
exercise has been reasonably considered certain have been taken into account.

Contracts may contain leasing and non-leasing components. The Group assigns the consideration in the contract
to the leasing and non-leasing components based on their relative independent prices. For real estate leases in
which the Group cannot separate the leasing and non-leasing components, it accounts for them as a single leasing
component.

Leasing payments are discounted using the implicit interest rate in the lease. If this rate cannot be easily
determined, which is generally the case for the group’s leases, the incremental interest rate is used. The
incremental interest rate is the interest rate that the lessee would incur at the commencement of the lease if it
borrowed, over a period of time, with similar guarantees and in a similar economic environment. The interest
was calculated as a combination of the following elements:

  - CDS curve of the economic environment

  - Euribor Swap Rate Curve.

  - Synthetic NH CDS curve.

These elements were combined to obtain an interest rate curve for each contract based on its geoeconomic
specificities and from which the calculation process consists of bringing each of the discounted flows to the
present value at the interest rate corresponding to each maturity within said curve and calculating which single
equivalent rate would be used to discount said flows.

Potential future increases in variable payments for leases based on an index or rate are not included in leasing
liabilities until they take effect. When the adjustments to the leasing payments based on an index or rate take
effect, the leasing liability is assessed again and set against the asset for right of use.

Leasing payments are allocated between principal and financial cost. The financial cost is charged to profit/(loss)
during the leasing period in a manner that creates a periodic interest rate on the remaining balance of the liability
for each period.

Right-of-use assets are valued at cost that comprises the following:

  - The initial valuation amount of the leasing liability.

  - Any leasing payment made on or before the state date, less any incentive to lease received.

  - Any initial indirect cost.

  - Restoration costs.

  - Incentives to lease received from the lessor.

  - Provision on onerous contracts


-----

**4.6 Financial Instruments**

**_4.6.1 Financial assets_**

Financial assets are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when they are acquired and initially recognised
at their fair value. The financial assets held by Group companies are classified as follows:

   - Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are those assets acquired by the companies with the
objective of obtaining the contractual flows and selling them; or those assets that do not consist exclusively
of the payment of the principal and interest and the management model is the sale of the same, in general
terms, practically all of the variation in the fair value of the Group's financial assets are recorded with a
charge to the consolidated statement of changes in equity. Interest income, exchange rate differences and
impairment losses are recognised in the income statement and other gains or losses are recognised in "Other
comprehensive profit and loss" in equity. Any cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is reclassified to
profit or loss at the time of derecognition.

   - Financial assets at amortised cost: assets whose contractual cash flows consist exclusively of principal and
interest payments and, if the management model of such assets is to hold them to obtain the contractual
flows. In this case, the Group records any changes in value with a charge to the consolidated comprehensive
profit and loss statement.

Transaction costs at the time of acquisition are recognised as an increase in acquisition cost or as an expense,
depending on whether the financial asset being transacted is considered at fair value through profit or loss.

Fair value of a financial instrument on a given date is construed as the amount for which it could be bought or
sold on that same date by two knowledgeable parties acting freely and prudently under conditions of mutual
independence.

Interest accrued on financial assets at amortised cost is recognised in the consolidated comprehensive profit and
loss statement on the basis of the effective interest rate. Amortised cost is construed as the initial cost minus any
collections or amortisation of the principal, taking into account any potential reductions based on expected loss.

As regards valuation corrections made to trade and other accounts receivable in particular, the criterion used by
the Group to calculate the corresponding valuation corrections, if any, generally consists of provisioning
according to the expected loss based on the credit risk of the customer portfolio.

The Group derecognises financial assets when the cash flow rights of the corresponding financial asset have
expired or have been transferred and the risks and rewards incidental to its ownership have been substantially all
transferred.

Conversely, the Group does not derecognise financial assets and recognises a financial liability for an amount
equal to the consideration received in the transfers of financial assets in which the risks and rewards inherent in
its ownership are substantially all retained.

**_4.6.2. Cash and cash equivalents_**

“Cash and Cash Equivalents” in the consolidated balance sheet includes cash, demand deposits and other shortterm, highly liquid investments that can be realised in cash quickly and are not subject to a risk of changes in
value.


-----

**_4.6.3 Financial liabilities_**

**Issues of bonds and other securities**

Debt issues are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, less the costs directly
attributable to the transaction. They are subsequently valued at their amortised cost using the effective interest
rate method. Bonds with a maturity date greater than twelve months are classified under non-current liabilities,
while those with a maturity date of less than twelve months are included in current liabilities.

In the case of renegotiations, if they were considered non-substantial and consequently did not require the derecognition of the financial liabilities, the carrying amount of the amortised cost of those financial liabilities at
the date of renegotiation is recalculated and a gain or loss due to changes in profit or loss is recognised.

Convertible bond issues are recognised at the time of their issue, distributing the fair value of the consideration
received between their equity and liability components, assigning the residual value obtained after deducting the
amount established separately for the liability component, from the fair value of these instruments as a whole, to
the equity instrument. The value of any derivative embedded in the compound financial instrument other than the
equity component will be included in the liability component.

**Bank loans**

Loans received from banking institutions are recognised at the amount received, net of costs incurred in the
transaction. They are subsequently valued at amortised cost. These costs incurred in the transaction and the
financial expenses are recognised on an accrual basis in the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement
using the effective interest rate method, and their amount is added to liabilities to the extent to which they are not
settled in the period they were produced.

In the case of renegotiations, if they were considered non-substantial and consequently did not require the derecognition of the financial liabilities, the carrying amount of the amortised cost of those financial liabilities at
the date of renegotiation is recalculated and a gain or loss due to changes in profit or loss is recognised.

**Trade and other payables**

Trade accounts payable are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently valued at amortised cost using
the effective interest rate method.

**Derivatives and hedge accounting**

Derivatives used to hedge the risks to which the Group’s operations are exposed, mainly exchange and interest
rate risks, are valued at market value on the date they are contracted. Any subsequent changes in their market
value are recognised as follows:

      - Concerning fair value hedges, the differences produced in both the hedging elements as well as in
the hedged elements (regarding the kind of risk hedged) are directly recognised in the consolidated
comprehensive profit and loss statement.

For cash flow hedges, valuation differences in the effective part of the hedge elements are temporarily recognised
in the equity item “Equity valuation adjustments” and their adjustment is recognised as a lower or higher cost in
the initial recognition of the item.

Hedge accounting is interrupted when the hedging instrument expires or is sold or finalised or exercised, or when
it no longer meets the hedge accounting criteria. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss corresponding to the
hedging instrument that has been recognised in equity is kept there until the expected transaction is undertaken.

When the transaction covered by the hedge is not expected to take place, the net cumulative gains or losses
recognised in equity are transferred to the profit or loss for the period. Any changes in the fair value of derivatives


-----

which fail to meet hedge accounting criteria are recognised in the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss
statement as they arise.

Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or in other main contracts are recognised separately as
derivatives only when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the main contract and
providing such main contracts are not valued at fair value with changes through consolidated comprehensive
profit and loss.

**Valuation techniques and assumptions applying to the measurement of fair value**

The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows:

    - The fair value of financial assets and liabilities under standard terms and conditions which are traded
in active liquid markets are based on market prices.

    - The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities (excluding derivatives) is determined in
accordance with generally accepted valuation models on the basis of cash flow discounting using
the price of observable market transactions and contributor listings of similar instruments.

    - In order to determine the fair value of interest rate derivatives, cash flow discounting is used based
on the implicit flow determined by the interest rate curve according to market conditions. In order
to determine the fair value of options, the Group uses the Black-Scholes valuation model and its
variants, using for this purpose market volatilities for the strike and maturity prices of said options.

Any financial instruments valued after their initial recognition at fair value are classified as level 1 to 3 based on
the extent to which fair value can be observed:

    - Level 1: includes any instruments indexed to listed prices (without adjustment) of identical assets
or liabilities in active markets.

    - Level 2: includes any instruments indexed to other observable inputs (which are not the listed prices
included under Level 1) for assets or liabilities, be it directly (i.e., prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived
from prices).

    - Level 3: includes any instruments indexed to valuation techniques, which include inputs for assets
or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

**_4.6.4. Equity instruments_**

An equity instrument represents a residual interest in the equity of the Parent Company once all its liabilities are
subtracted.

Equity instruments issued by the Parent Company are recognised in equity for the amount received, net of the
issue expenses.

**4.7 Non-current assets and associated liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations**

Assets and liabilities the carrying amount of which is recovered through a sale and not from continued use are
classified as non-current assets held for sale and liabilities associated with non-current assets held for sale. This
condition is considered to be met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate
sale in its current state, and it is estimated that the sale will be completed within one year from the date of
classification.

Non-current assets and associated liabilities classified as held for sale are valued at the lower of their historic cost
or their fair value less selling expenses.


-----

Discontinued operations represent components of the Group which will be disposed of. These components are
activities and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group, both operationally and for
the purposes of financial reporting, and represent lines of business or geographical areas which can be considered
as separate from the rest.

**4.8 Shareholdings in associated companies**

Investments in companies over which the Parent exercises significant influence or are jointly controlled are
accounted for using the equity method (see Appendix II). The carrying amount of the investment in the associate
includes the goodwill and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income includes the share in the results
of the associate's operations. If the associate recognises gains or losses directly in equity, the Group also
recognises its share in such items directly in equity.

At each year-end, the existence of indicators of a potential impairment of the investment in the associate is
assessed in order to recognise the related impairment loss, where appropriate In order to determine the reasonable
amount of the investments in companies whose sole asset consists of property inventories, appraisals were
obtained from the same independent valuer that appraised the Group's inventories. In the case of the other
companies, discounted cash flow valuations were performed internally, similar to those described in Note 4.4.

**4.9 Foreign currency transactions and balances**

The Group’s functional currency is the euro. Consequently, any transactions in currencies other than the euro are
considered as “foreign currency” and are recognised according to the prevailing exchange rate on the date the
transactions are performed.

Cash assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted into the functional currency at the
prevailing exchange rate on the date of each consolidated profit and loss statement. Any gains or losses thus
revealed are recognised directly in consolidated comprehensive profit and loss.

**4.10** **Classification of financial assets and debts into current and non-current**

In the attached consolidated balance sheet, financial assets and debts are classified on the basis of their maturity;
in other words, those with a maturity date equivalent to or less than twelve months are classified as current and
those with a maturity date exceeding this are non-current.

**4.11** **Income and expenses**

Income and expenses are recognised on an accrual basis, i.e. when the control of goods and services they represent
has been transferred, irrespective of the moment when the monetary or financial flows deriving from them arise.

More specifically, income is calculated at the fair value of the consideration to be received and represents the
amounts to be collected for the goods and services delivered within the ordinary framework of operations,
subtracting any discounts and taxes.

**Sale of rooms and other related services**

Income from the sale of rooms and other related services is recognised daily based on the services provided by
each hotel, including customers who are still staying at the hotel at the close of each day.

The consideration received is distributed among the contracted services. These include direct services such as
room, food, drink and other consumption, and others related to banquets, events and the rental of spaces.

**Provision of services**


-----

The Group recognizes the income from its hotel management contracts in the year in which the services are
provided, based on the evolution of the variables that determines this income and which are mainly the total
income and the gross operating profit of each hotel managed by the Group.

**4.12 Official subsidies**

Group companies follow the criteria set out below in recognising official subsidies:

  - Non-reimbursable capital subsidies (connected with assets) are valued at the amount granted, recognised
as deferred income and taken into profit and loss in proportion to the depreciation of the assets financed
by such subsidies during the financial year.

  - Operating subsidies are recognised as income at the moment of their accrual.

**4.13 Corporation tax**

The cost of the year’s corporation tax is calculated through the sum of the current tax resulting from applying the
tax rate to the taxable income for the year and then applying the relevant tax adjustments according to the law
plus any changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities include temporary differences, being any amounts expected to be payable or
recoverable due to differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities and their tax value, as
well as tax loss carry-forwards and any credits resulting from unapplied tax deductions. Said amounts are
recognised by applying to the relevant temporary difference or credit the tax rate at which they are expected to be
recovered or settled.

In some countries, the tax rate varies depending on whether a transfer of assets is made. In these cases, the
Group’s policy consists of applying the effective tax rate at which they are expected to be recovered or settled. In
the opinion of the Parent’s Directors, the deferred tax thus calculated covers the amount which may eventually
be settled, if any, in the foregoing case.

Deferred tax liabilities for all taxable temporary differences are recognised, except for those in which the
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill amortisation of which is not tax-deductible
or the initial recognition of other operating assets and liabilities which do not affect either the tax or accounting
result.

Deferred tax assets identified as temporary differences are recognised only if it is deemed probable that the
consolidated entities will make sufficient tax profits in the future to realise them and they do not come from the
initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which does not affect either the tax or accounting
result. Other deferred tax assets (tax loss carry-forwards and tax credits) are recognised only if it is likely that the
consolidated companies will make sufficient tax profits in the future to be able to apply them.

At each year-end, deferred taxes (both assets and liabilities) are reviewed in order to verify that they remain in
force and the relevant corrections are made in accordance with the outcome of the analyses conducted.

**4.14 Obligations to employees**

Spanish hotel companies are obliged to make a specific number of monthly salary payments to those employees
who leave the company due to retirement, permanent disability or upon reaching a certain age and having a certain
number of years of service and fulfilling certain pre-established requirements.

In this regard and in compliance with Royal Decree-Law 16/2005, the Group has outsourced its pension
obligations for its employees' pension plans.


-----

Also, in accordance with Italian law, employees of Italian companies have the right to compensation if they resign
or are dismissed.

Its obligations to personnel also include those arising from contracting pension funds for certain employees, which
in the Group, mainly affects the business units of Italy and the Netherlands.

Therefore, to provide for these obligations to future payments to personnel, the Group has recognised a liability
under “Provisions for Risks and Charges” (See Note 18).

**4.15 Onerous contracts**

The Group considers onerous agreements to be those in which the inevitable costs of fulfilling the obligations
they entail exceed the economic benefits expected from them.

The Group follows the principle of recording a provision at the present value of the aforementioned differences
between the costs and benefits of the contract, or the compensation foreseen for abandonment of the contract, if
such is decided.

The methodology, assumptions and discount rates used to calculate any necessary provisions are applied in
accordance with the criteria described in Note 4.4.

**4.16 Share-based Remuneration Schemes**

These schemes, which are settled in shares, are valued at the time of granting, using a financial method based on
a binomial model which takes into consideration the strike price, volatility, the exercise period, the expected
dividends, the risk-free interest rate and the assumptions made concerning the financial year.

In accordance with IFRS 2, the above-mentioned valuation is recognised in profit or loss under personnel
expenses during the period established as a requirement for the employee to remain in the company before
exercising the option. Said value is recognised on a straight-line basis in the consolidated comprehensive profit
and loss statement from the date the option is granted until the date on which it is exercised.

On each subsequent closing date, the Group reviews the estimates regarding the number of options expected to
be exercisable, adjusting the equity figure if necessary.

**4.17 Treasury shares**

Pursuant to IAS 32, treasury shares are presented by reducing the Group’s equity. Treasury shares are recognised
at the value of the consideration paid and are deducted directly from equity. Gains and losses on the acquisition,
sale, issue or retirement of treasury shares are recognised directly in equity and in no case are they recognised in
the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement.

**4.18 Provisions**

The Group follows the policy of provisioning for the estimated amounts arising from ongoing litigation,
indemnities or obligations, as well as for any sureties or guarantees granted by Group companies which could
involve the Group in a payment obligation (either legal or implicit), provided the amount can be reliably
estimated.

Provisions are quantified based on the best information available on the position and evolution of the events that
cause them and are re-estimated at the end of each reporting period, being totally or partially reversed when these
obligations cease to exist or decrease.


-----

Contingent liabilities, except in business combinations, are not recognised in the consolidated financial
statements, but are reported in the notes to the financial statements, in accordance with the requirements of IAS
37.

**4.19** **Severance pay**

In accordance with current employment regulations and certain employment contracts, the Group is obliged to
pay indemnities to employees who are dismissed under certain conditions. The Group recognised expenses of
3,119 thousand euros for this item in 2019 (5,751 thousand euros in 2018).

The consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2019 includes, pursuant to IFRS (IAS 37), a provision of 841
thousand euros for this item (1,059 thousand euros at 31 December 2018).

**4.20** **Business combinations**

Business combinations whereby the Group acquires control of an entity are accounted for using the acquisition
cost method, calculating goodwill as the difference between the sum of the consideration transferred, the noncontrolling interests and the fair value of any previous stake in the acquired entity, less the identifiable net assets
of the acquired entity, measured at fair value.

In the event that the difference between these items is negative, income is recognised in the consolidated
comprehensive profit and loss statement.

In the case of business combinations carried out in stages, goodwill is measured and recognised only once control
of a business has been acquired. To do this, previous holdings are re-measured at fair value and the corresponding
gain or loss is recognised.

**4.21 Environmental policy**

Investments arising from environmental activities are valued at their original cost and capitalised as increases in
the cost of fixed assets or inventory in the financial year in which they are incurred.

Any expenses arising from environmental protection and improvement are recognised in the consolidated
comprehensive profit and loss statements for the year in which they are incurred, irrespective of the moment when
the cash or financial flows deriving from them arise.

Provisions for likely or certain liabilities, ongoing litigation and outstanding indemnities or obligations of an
indeterminate amount connected with the environment and not covered by the insurance policies taken out are
established at the time the liability or obligation linked to the indemnities or payment arises.

**4.22** **Consolidated cash flow statements**

The following terms with their corresponding explanation are used in the consolidated cash flow statement
prepared using the indirect method:

   - Cash flows: inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents, which are short-term, highly liquid
investments that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

   - Operational activities: the typical activities of the entities forming the consolidated group, along with
other activities that cannot be classified as investing or financing activities.

###### - Investing activities: the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included

in cash and cash equivalents.


-----

###### - Financing activities: activities that result in changes in the size and composition of the equity and

liabilities that are not operating activities.

**4.23** **Treatment of companies in hyperinflationary economies**

In 2018, Argentina was declared a hyperinflationary economy due, among other causes, to the fact that the
accumulated inflation rate of its economy exceeded 100% over a continuous period of three years.

As a result, the Group began to apply IAS 29 to the financial statements of Argentine companies with retroactive
effect from 1 January 2018. The application of this standard entails the following exceptions to what is stated
above in the rest of the valuation standards:

    - Adjusting the historical cost of non-monetary assets and liabilities and the different equity items
from the acquisition date or inclusion on the consolidated balance sheet until year-end to reflect the
changes in currency’s purchasing power resulting from the inflation.

    - Reflecting the loss or gain corresponding to the impact of inflation for the year on the net monetary
position in the profit and loss account.

    - Adjusting the various items of the profit and loss account and the cash flow statement for the
inflationary index since its generation, with a counterpart in financial results and in a reconciliation
item on the cash flow statement, respectively.

    - Converting all components of the financial statements of Argentine companies at the closing
exchange rate; the exchange rate at 31 December 2019 was 67.20 pesos per euro.

    - The figures from the years prior to 2018 should not be amended.

**5.** **EARNINGS PER SHARE**

Basic earnings per share (EPS) are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to the Group in a period
by the weighted average number of shares in circulation during the period, excluding the average number of
treasury shares held during the same period.

In accordance with this:

31.12.2019 31.12.2018

Net profit for the year (thousands of euros) 89,964 101,573

Weighted average number of shares in circulation (in thousands) 391,754 369,873

**Basic earnings per share in euros** **0.230** **0.275**

**6.-** **GOODWILL**

The balance included under this item corresponds to the net goodwill arising from the acquisition of certain
companies, and breaks down as follows (thousands of euros):

from their worsening expectations of future cash flows mainly due to the opening of competitor hotels or the loss
of a major customer.

The basic assumptions used to estimate future cash flows of the CGUs mentioned above are detailed below:

  - After‐tax discount rate: 5.47% and 6.44% (6.22% and 7.86% respectively in 2018) for CGUs subject to
the same risks (German and Austrian market); and for Grupo Royal CGUs, rates of 12.86% (Colombian
and Ecuadorian markets) and 9.39% (Chilean market) (14.64% and 10.56% respectively in 2018).

  - Terminal value growth rate (g): 2.13% and 2.00% (2.01% and 2.56% in 2018) for Germany and Austria
and 1.10%, 3% and 3.04% (1.22%, 3% and 3.04% in 2018) for Grupo Royal CGUs (Ecuador, Chile and
Colombia).

  - Additionally, and considering the assumption implied in the preceding paragraph, the Group has
conducted a sensitivity analysis of the result of the impairment test to changes in the following situations:

NH Hoteles Deutschland, GmbH and NH Hoteles Austria, GmbH

Occupancy rate 69.00% 68.31% 69.69%

ADR (thousands of COPs) 290.81 287.9 293.72

"Average Daily Rate" (ADR): is the quotient of total room revenue for a specific period divided by the rooms
sold in that specific period. This indicator is used to compare with companies in the sector the average prices per
room of the hotels.

Scenario 1 is a negative one where the discount rate is raised 1 b.p. above the rate used in the test and a growth
rate lower by 1 b.p., i.e. with minimum growth, and falls in occupancy and ADR of 1% which would lead to an
additional impairment to that registered in 2019 for an amount of 0.8 million euros with respect to the goodwill
of NH Hotels Deutschland, Gmbh and NH Hoteles Austria, Gmbh, and 10.5 million euros with respect to the
goodwill of Hoteles Royal, S.A.

In the case of scenario 2, an impairment had been recorded for 0.79 thousand euros less than that recorded at 31
December 2018 with respect to the goodwill of NH Hotels Deutschland, Gmbh and NH Hoteles Austria, Gmbh,
and no impairment in regard to the goodwill of Hoteles Royal, S.A. was registered.

**7.1 Hotel operating rights**

The main movement in 2019 corresponds to the classification of various assets related to lease contracts which,
at 1 January 2019, are considered as the higher value of the right-of-use assets in accordance with the application
of IFRS 16 (See note 9).

**7.2 Software applications**

The most significant inclusions in the current year were in Spain, as a result of the investments made to develop
the corporate WEBSITE and implement front office systems of the hotels and IT transformation plan projects.

**7.3 Other rights**

The main movement in 2019 corresponds to the classification of various assets related to lease contracts which,
at 1 January 2019, are considered as the higher value of the right-of-use assets in accordance with the application
of IFRS 16 (See note 9).

As a result of the change of control of the NH Group (see Note 14.1) on 30 November 2018, the effective
termination of all the management contracts defined in the framework contract entered into in 2017 with Grupo
Inversor Hesperia, S.A. ("GIHSA") was formalised, the latter being a former shareholder of the NH Group, for
the management of 28 hotels for a period of nine years, which until then had been managed by the NH Group as
this contract included an early termination clause in the event of a change of control of the NH Group.

As a result of this termination, the Group has de-recognised the net book value of the activated management
contracts amounting to 30.4 million euros. In the same way, a revenue of 33 million euros has been recorded
corresponding to the "Net Price Refund Amount" defined in the framework contract, which includes the receipt
of an advance indemnity revenue amounting to 20 million euros, the settlement of the pending payment by NH
related to the premiums for contracts amounting to 11,560 thousand euros, which was recognised under "Other
Financial Liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2017, and the sale of the Hesperia brand,
the net book value of which amounted to 45 thousand euros, for an amount of 1.4 million euros. The net effect of
2.6 million euros of revenue arising from the early cancellation of the contract entered into with GIHSA, before
its tax impact, is recognised under "Net result on disposal of assets" of the 2019 consolidated comprehensive profit
and loss statement.

During 2018, reversals of 436 thousand euros and transfers of 182 thousand euros were recognised under "Net
Profits/(Losses) from asset impairment" of the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement (See note 8).

The main additions and reductions in 2019 are due to the repositioning plan carried out by the Group, with
refurbishments in all Business Units. Of note are the works of the NH Luz de Huelva and NH Malaga in Spain,
the renovation of the NH Palermo and NH Ambassador in Italy, the works of the NH Vienna Airport and the NH
Hamburg Altona and the new opening of the NH Leipzig Zentrum in Central Europe, the works of the NH
Conference Centre Leeuwenhorst and the NH Collection Flower Market in Benelux. Finally, in New York,
refurbishment of the NH New York Jolly Madison Towers.

The effect on the profit and loss account of assets de-recognised, replaced or disposed of to third parties outside
the Group was and expense of 4,627 thousand euros, recognised under "Gain/(loss) on the disposal of non-current
assets" in the 2019 consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement.

The net additions in the year in the column "Changes in the scope of consolidation" come from the purchase of
the company Anantara The Marker Ltd (see Note 2.8.4).

The net effect from applying IAS 29 in 2019 was the 1.5 million euro increase in assets recorded in the “Exchange
differences and adjustments for hyperinflation” column. In 2018, the first year of application, the impact was as
follows( See Note 2.4):

In 2019, and impairment amounting to 4,289 thousand euros has been recognised for certain assets; this
impairment mainly corresponds to real estate and is a result of the worsening of future expectations of cash flows
for different reasons, including the opening of competitors' hotels or the loss of an important customer (10,034
thousand euros in 2018). On the other hand, there was a reversal of 9,288 thousand euros resulting from the
improvement in future cash flows expectations of some hotels. The net effect recorded under the heading
“Profits/(Net losses) due to impairment of assets” on the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement for
2019, has been an income of 4,999 thousand euros.

The breakdown of impairment by country is as follows (in thousands of euros):

At 31 December 2019, there were tangible fixed asset elements with a net book value of 232 million euros (237
million euros in 2018) to guarantee several mortgage loans and secured senior bonds maturing 2023 (see Note
16).

The Group has taken out insurance policies to cover any possible risks to which the different elements of its
tangible fixed assets are subject, and to cover any possible claims that may be filed against it in the course of its
activities. It is understood that such policies sufficiently cover the risks to which the Group is exposed.

At 31 December 2019, firm purchase undertakings amounted to 37.8 million euros. These investments will be
made between 2010 and 2021 (66.7 million euros in 2018).

IFRS 16 became effective on 1 January 2019, replacing IAS 17, IFRIC 4, SIC-15 and SIC-17 and establishing
the principals for recognising, measuring, presenting and the breakdown leases. In this regard, information on
leases where the NH Group is a lessee is presented below.

are as follows:

The “Contract premiums” and “Operating rights” headings are intangible assets related to lease contracts that
were recorded as such in 2018 and that, with the application of IFRS 16, were reclassified at 1 January 2019 to
right-of-use assets.

Additions to right-of-use assets during 2019 amounted to 131,428 thousand euros, offset by the amortisation
expense recorded for the year amounting to 181,079 thousand euros.

The main recognitions for the year are due to the incorporation of several hotels on a lease basis. Of note is the
incorporation of the Anantara Villa Padierna and the NH Collection Finisterre in Spain; NH Collection Fori
Imperiali in Italy; and NH Collection Antwerp Centre in Belgium.

Likewise, among the additions for the year is the acquisition of GCS Hotel Limited operating the Anantara The
Marker hotel in Dublin under lease and whose first consolidation difference was assigned to the lease contract of
said property recording it as a right-of-use asset under the heading “Operating rights” for an amount of 9,428
thousand euros (See Note 2.8.4).

The movement in both right-of-use assets and leasing liabilities is mainly non-cash given that the asset is modified
based on the variations produced in the liability, either due to changes in the contract’s payment structure or by
the update in accordance with revenues benchmarks.

The main impacts on the statement on the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement related to the
application of IFRS 16 are a higher financial expense of 89,620 thousand euros, a net gain of the disposal of noncurrent assets of 1,044 thousand euros, due mainly to cancellations of contracts that had no cash impact and net
gains on asset impairment of 2,175 thousand euros.

The amounts recorded as right-of-use assets correspond to properties where the NH Group is a lessee for its
operation as a hotel.

Short-term leases and low-value leases are recognised as an expense in the consolidated profit and loss account
on a straight line basis. A short-term lease contract is one where the period is less than or equal to 12 months. A
“low value contract” is one whose underlying asset assigned in use would have a new value of under 5,000 euros.

In January 2019, the Group sold its 49% shareholding in Beijing NH Grand China Hotel Management Co., Ltd.
(see Note 2.7.4).

The Group's policy on holdings in associated companies consists of ceasing to book losses in these companies if
the associated company's consolidated losses attributable to the Group are equivalent to or exceed the cost of its
holding in them, provided there are no additional contingencies or guarantees connected with existing losses. This
is the situation of the stake in Losan Investment, Ltd.

**11. NON-CURRENT FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS**

**11.1** **Loans and accounts receivable not available for trading**

The breakdown of this item at 31 December 2019 and 2018 is as follows:

Thousands of euros

2019 2018

Subordinated loans to companies owning hotels operated by the
Group through leases 20,505 21,487

Other collection rights     - 3,039

Lease advance payments     - 3,005

Loans to associates (Note 26) 143     
Long-term deposits and sureties 12,703 13,165

Others 1,976 1,902

**Total** **35,327** **42,598**

The “Subordinated loans to companies owning hotels operated by the Group through leases” item includes a series
of loans granted by the Group to companies which own hotels in countries such as Germany, Austria, the
Netherlands, Italy and Spain, and which are operated by the Group under a leasing agreement.

The main features of these agreements are as follows:

   - Hotel rentals are not subject to evolution of the inflation rate or to that of any other index.

   - The aforementioned subordinated loans accrue interest at a fixed rate of 3% per annum.

   - Lease agreements establish a purchase right on properties subject to agreements that, as a general rule,
may be executed in the fifth, tenth and fifteenth year from the entry into force of the agreement.

   - The model used for these lease agreements has been analysed and independent experts consider them to
be operating leases.

At year-end 2018, “Other collection rights” included the claim for the sale of fifteen commercial premises. During
2019, an agreement was reached to deliver the aforementioned premises by cancelling the recorded accounts
receivable and incorporating these premises in the “Investment Property” line.

The “Lease advance payments” item includes the advance payments made to the owners of certain hotels operated
under a lease arrangement for the purchase of decoration and furniture; these are discounted from future rental
payments. Resulting from the application of the new lease standard IFRS 16, there is no concept of linearisation
(See Note 2.1.1).

**11.2** **Other non-current financial investments**

This heading of the consolidated balance sheet comprised, at 31 December 2019 and 2018, the following equity
interests, valued at cost:

In December 2019, the Group sold its 9.87% shareholding in Varallo Comercial, S.A. and its 13.6% shareholding
in Adquisiciones e Inversiones Europeo, S.L. The result of the operation was a consolidated gain of 8,525 thousand
euros recorded under “Gains on financial and other operations”. At year-end 2019, the Group had an account
receivable under “Other non-trade debtors” for 17,017 thousand euros related to said sale. This amount has been
collected in full the 2[nd] of January 2020.

In regard to the fair value of financial assets, it does not differ significantly from its book value.

**12.-** **NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE, LIABILITIES LINKED TO NON-CURRENT**
**ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS**

In accordance with IFRS 5, Non-current assets classified as held for sale and discontinued operations (see Note
4.7), the group has classified non-strategic assets under this heading which are undergoing divestment with
committed sales plans.

The assets classified as held for sale, after deducting their liabilities, were measured at the lower of their carrying
amount and the expected sales price minus costs.

Specifically, the shareholdings in Sotocaribe, S.L and Capredo Investments GmbH are classified as discontinued
operations; these companies represented the entirety of the Group’s property activity. Sotocaribe, S.L. was
consolidated by the equity method, while Capredo Investments, GmbH was consolidated by the global method.

Additionally, in 2018, the land and property in which the NH Málaga II hotel is located, the sale of which was
formalised in February this year, was recognised as available for sale. This transaction represented an asset derecognition of 12,758 thousand euros and a positive pre-tax result of 2,874 thousand euros recorded under "Net
result on disposal of assets".

There are no restrictions on the availability of cash, except for 2,841 thousand euros reserved in accordance with
a firm commitment with the co-owners of Hoteles Royal (2,207 thousand euros in 2018) for future investments in
the hotels.

As at 31 December 2019, there were no restrictions on the receipt of dividends distributed by the companies in
which the Parent Company holds a direct or indirect minority shareholding other than the legally established
regulations on the distribution of dividends.

As a result of the enactment of Royal Decree 1558/2012 of 15 November, of Article 42 bis of Royal Decree
1065/2007 of 27 July, approving the General Regulations on tax management, inspection and procedures, and
implementing the common rules of the procedures for applying taxes, which establishes certain reporting
obligations with regard to overseas assets and rights, among others, it is disclosed that some members of the NH
Hotel Group S.A. Board of Directors have the right, as representatives or authorised officials, to dispose of bank
accounts located abroad, which are in the name of Group companies. The reason certain Board members have the
right to dispose of overseas bank accounts is that they are directors or board members of said subsidiaries.

NH Hotel Group S.A. holds other accounting documents, namely the consolidated annual accounts, from which
sufficient data can be extracted in relation to the aforementioned accounts.

**15.** **EQUITY**

**15.1 Subscribed share capital**

NH Hotel Group, S.A. share capital at 31 December 2019 comprised 392,180,243 fully subscribed and paid up
bearer shares with a par value of 2 euros each. All these shares carry identical voting and economic rights and are
traded on the Continuous Market of the Spanish Stock Exchanges.

According to the latest notifications received by the Parent Company and the notices given to the National
Securities Market Commission before the end of every financial year, the most significant shareholdings at 31
December 2019 and 31 December 2018 were as follows:

31/12/2019 31/12/2018

Minor International Public Company Limited (“MINT”)[(1)] 94.13% 94.13%

The aforementioned (indirect) shareholding of MINT in NH Hotel Group, S.A. is the result of the IPO made by
MHG Continental Holding (Singapore) Pte Ltd. on 11 June 2018 for 100% of the shares that were part of the
share capital of NH Hotel Group, S.A., the result of which was that MINT acquired, through its wholly owned
subsidiary MHG Continental Holding (Singapore) Pte. Ltd, shares representing 94.13% of the share capital of NH
Hotel Group, S.A.

(1) MINT is the indirect shareholder through MHG Continental Holding (Singapore) Pte Ltd.

**15.2** **Dividends**

The General Shareholders’ Meeting on 13 May 2019 approved, among other items, the proposed distribution of
dividends. It therefore decided to draw from the profits of the year ended 31 December 2018 and distribute a
dividend of 15 euro cents gross per share in the parent company NH Hotel Group, S.A. with the right to receive
it, outstanding on the date of the payment; all according to the following schedule:

`o` Last date of trading with dividend: 11 June 2019

`o` Ex-dividend date: 12 June 2019

`o` Registration date: 13 June 2019

This dividend was distributed through the companies with shares in “Sociedad de Gestión de los Sistemas de
Registro, Compensación y Liquidación de Valores, S.A. Unipersonal” (IBERCLEAR), with powers granted for
this purpose to the Board of Directors, with express powers of substitution, so that after checking for compliance
with obligations under the finance contracts of NH HOTEL GROUP, S.A., the Board will designate an entity to
act as paying agent and will perform the other necessary or advisable actions for a satisfactory distribution. The
total amount distributed as dividends was 58.771 million euros.

**15.3** **Parent Company Reserves**

i) Legal reserve

In accordance with the Consolidated Text of the Corporate Enterprises Act, 10% of the net profit for
each year must be allocated to the legal reserve until it reaches at least 20% of share capital. The legal
reserve may be used to increase capital provided the remaining balance does not fall below 10% of
the increased capital amount. With the exception of the aforementioned purpose, and when it does
not exceed 20% of share capital, this reserve may be used only to offset losses, provided no other
reserves are available for this purpose.

At 31 December 2019 and 2018, the parent company's legal reserve was not fully constituted.

ii) Share premium

The Consolidated Text of the Corporate Enterprises Act expressly allows the balance of this reserve
to be used to increase capital and imposes no restrictions on its availability.

**15.4** **Treasury shares**

At 31 December 2019, the Group had 374,464 own shares, compared to 600,000 own shares at 31 December
2018. The reduction in treasury shares over the period can be explained by the following movement:

  - In the first half of 2019, the third cycle of the long-term incentive plan was settled (see Note 14). This
second cycle was settled by the delivery of 226,067 shares valued at 1,670 thousand euros.

  - On 10 April 2019, the Group signed a liquidity contract to manage its treasury shares with Banco
Santander, which entered into force on 11 April 2019. The total number of shares allocated to the
securities account associated with the new Liquidity Contract is 82,645 shares and the amount allocated
to the cash account is 400,000 euros. At 31 December 2019, the number of shares assigned to the liquidity
contract was 83,176 shares. The negative effect recorded in reserves for operations carried out in the first
half of the year was 87 thousand euros.

On 14 December 2018, the Company carried out the partial voluntary early redemption, for a nominal amount of
40,000 thousand euros (representing 10% of its original total amount), of the senior secured bond issue maturing
in 2023 (the "Bonds"), by means of a linear pro rata reduction of the nominal value of all the bonds in circulation.
The Bonds were redeemed early through the payment of approximately 103.760% of the nominal value of the
Bonds being redeemed, including:

- Nominal paid in advance: 40 million euros

- Unpaid accrued interest: 304.2 thousand euros

- Amount of the repurchase premium: 1.20 million euros

The Company paid the partial redemptions from available cash.

**Secured credit line**

On 22 September 2016, the Parent Company and NH Finance, S.A. entered into a revolving business credit with
credit institutions amounting to 250,000 thousand euros ("syndicated credit line") with a maturity of three years,
extendable to five years at the time of the refinancing of the guaranteed senior notes maturing in 2019. As a
consequence of the refinancing and early payments of the guaranteed senior notes maturing in 2019 which took
place in 2017, the maturity date of said financing was extended to 29 September 2021. At 31 December 2019, this
financing was not available.

**Obligations required in the guaranteed senior note indentures maturing in 2023 and in the syndicated**
**credit line**

The senior notes maturing in 2023 and the syndicated credit line require the fulfilment of a series of obligations
and limitations of essentially homogeneous content as regards the assumption of additional borrowing or provision
of guarantees in favour of third parties, the granting of real guarantees on assets, the sale of assets, investments
that are permitted, restricted payments (including the distribution of dividends to shareholders), transactions
between related parties, corporate transactions and disclosure obligations. These obligations are detailed in the
issue prospectus for the aforementioned notes, as well as in the credit agreement of the syndicated credit line.

In addition, the syndicated credit line requires compliance with financial ratios; in particular (i) an interest
coverage ratio of > 2.00x, (ii) a debt coverage ratio of < 5.50x, and (iii) a Loan to Value ("LTV") ratio which, as
a result of the redemption of the 2019 senior secured obligations due in 2017, depends on the level of NH's
indebtedness at any given time as indicated below:

- Net debt-to-income ratio ˃ 4.00x: LTV ratio = 70%

- Net debt-to-income ratios ≤ 4.00x: LTV ratio = 85%

- Net debt-to-income ratio ≤ 3.50x: LTV ratio = 100%

As a result of the early redemption of the convertible bonds and of the Group's reduced net debt-to-income ratio,
the maximum LTV permitted at 31 December 2019 is 100%.

At 31 December 2019 these ratios were completely adhered to.

**Package of guaranteed senior notes maturing in 2023 and syndicated credit line**

The guaranteed senior notes maturing in 2023 and syndicated credit line (undrawn at 31 December 2019) share

**Variable interest (amount of the syndicated credit line undrawn)** **250,000**

**Limitation on the distribution of Dividends**

The guaranteed senior notes maturing in 2023 and the syndicated credit line described above contain clauses
limiting the distribution of dividends.

In the case of the senior notes maturing in 2023, the distribution of dividends is generally permitted provided that
(a) the interest coverage ratio is > 2.0x and (b) the sum of restricted payments (including dividends and repayment
of subordinated debt) made since 8 November 2013 is less than the sum of, amongst other items, (I) 50% of NH's
consolidated net income (even though in the calculation of net income,100% of consolidated net losses must be
deducted) from 1 July 2013 to the date of the last quarterly accounts available (this is what is known as the CNI
Builder) and, (ii) 100% of the net contributions to NH’s capital from 8 November 2013.

Additionally, as an alternative and without having to be in compliance with the previous condition: (i) in the case
of bonds maturing in 2023, NH may distribute dividends provided that the leverage ratio (gross debt/EBITDA)
does not exceed 4.5x.

Finally, and also alternatively and without having to be concurrent with the previous ones, the notes maturing in
2023 establish a franchise to be able to make restricted payments (including dividends) without needing to comply
with any specific requirement, for a total aggregate amount of 25,000,000 euros as of November 2013.

In the case of the syndicated credit line, the distribution of a percentage of the NH Group’s consolidated net profit
from the previous year is allowed, provided that there has been no breach of the financing agreement and the Net
Financial Debt (through the Dividend payment) / EBITDA Ratio is less than 4.0x.

The maximum percentage of the consolidated net profit to be distributed will depend on the Debt Ratio.
Net Financial (through the payment of the Dividend) / EBITDA according to the following breakdown:

- Net Financial Debt / EBITDA ≤ 4.0x: Percentage of consolidated net profit: 75%

- Net Financial Debt / EBITDA ≤ 3.5x: Percentage of consolidated net profit: 100%

- Net Financial Debt / EBITDA ≤ 3.0x: Percentage of consolidated net profit: unlimited

**Total** **59,384** **12,864** **(18,356)** **-** **53,891**

At 1 January 2019, due to the application of IFRS 16, the provision for onerous contracts is registered as the lower
value of the right of use (See Note 2.1.1).

**Provision for pensions and similar obligations**

The “Provisions for pensions and similar obligations” account mainly includes the pension fund of a certain
number of employees of the Netherlands business unit, and the T.F.R. “Trattamento di fine rapporto” in Italy, an
amount paid to all workers in Italy at the moment they leave the company for any reason. This is another
remuneration element, whose payment is deferred and annually allocated in proportion to fixed and variable
remuneration both in kind and in cash, which is valued on a regular basis. The annual amount to be reserved is
equivalent to the remuneration amount divided by 13.5. The annual cumulative fund is reviewed at a fixed interest
rate of 1.5% plus 75% of the increase in the consumer price index (CPI).

This section also includes various retirement, performance related and/or long-stay awards considered in the
Collective Bargaining Agreements that are applicable in Spain.

The allocations column includes the change in accounting criteria of 12,191 thousand euros, resulting in a net
impact of taxes on equity of 9,692 thousand euros. (see Note 2.3)

At the end of 2019, the liabilities entered against this item were of 28,919 thousand euros (16,740 thousand euros
at 31 December 2018).

**Other claims**

The "Other claims" item includes provisions for disputes and risks that the Group considers likely to occur. Among
the most significant are the provisions created on the basis of the action brought in the proceedings claiming
breach of contract in a property development, as well as other claims received in relation to the termination of
certain leases where certain amounts are claimed. No decision on these claims is expected in the short term (see
Note 23).

**19.- TAX NOTE**

**Tax consolidation scheme**

The Group operates in many countries and is therefore subject to the regulations of different tax jurisdictions
regarding taxation and corporate income tax.

NH Hotel Group, S.A. and another 17 companies with tax domicile in Spain in which it held a direct or indirect
stake of at least 75% during the 2019 tax period are subject to the tax consolidation scheme governed by Title
VII, Chapter VI of Law 27/2014 on Corporate Income Tax.

The companies belonging to the tax group have signed an agreement to share the tax burden. Hence, the Parent
Company settles any credits and debts which arise with subsidiary companies due to the negative and positive tax
bases these contribute to the tax group.

The companies that make up the tax consolidation group are the following:

NH Hotel Group, S.A. NH Europa, S.L.

Latinoamericana de Gestión Hotelera, S.L. Atardecer Caribeño, S.L.

NH Central Reservation Office, S.L. Hoteles Hesperia, S.A.

NH Hoteles España, S.A. Nuevos Espacios Hoteleros, S.A.

NH Hotel Ciutat de Reus, S.A. Coperama Holding, S.L.

Gran Círculo de Madrid, S.A. Coperama Spain, S.L.

Cash Links, S.L.U. NH Las Palmas, S.A.

Iberinterbrokers, S.L. NH Lagasca, S.A.

Wilan Ander, S.L. Wilan Huel S.L.

Corporation tax is calculated on the financial or accounting profit or loss resulting from the application of
generally accepted accounted standards in each country, and does not necessarily coincide with the tax result, this
being construed as the tax base.

In 2019, Spanish companies pay taxes at the general tax rate of 25% irrespective of whether they apply the
consolidated or separate taxation schemes. The foreign companies are subject to the prevailing tax rate in the
countries where they are domiciled. In addition, taxes are recognised in some countries at the estimated minimum
profit on a complementary basis to Corporation Tax.

The prevailing corporation tax rates applicable to Group companies in the different jurisdictions where the Group
has significant operations are as follows:


-----

**Country** **Nominal tax rate Country** **Nominal tax rate**

Argentina 30% Italy 24%

Austria 25% Luxembourg 17%

Belgium 30% Mexico 30%

Brasil 34% Netherlands 25%

Chile 27% Poland 19%

Colombia 33% Portugal 21%

Czech R. 19% Romania 16%

Dominican R. 27% South Africa 28%

Ecuador 25% Spain 25%

France 28% Switzerland 9%

Germany 30% United Kingdom 19%

Hugary 9% Uruguay 25%

Ireland 12.5% USA 21%

**Financial years subject to tax inspection**

In accordance with Spanish tax legislation, the years open for review to the Consolidated Tax Group are:

**Tax loss carryforwards**

**Tax**
Corporation 2014 - 2018

VAT 2016 to 2019

IRPF (personal income tax) 2016 to 2019

Non-resident Income Tax 2016 to 2019

In Spain during 2019, a verification and investigation process partially began to reduce the Taxable Base of
revenues from certain intangible assets referred to in article 23 of the TRLIS related to Corporation Tax for the
years 2016 to 2018. The Company has recorded a provision of 1 million euros in 2019. In February 2020, the
agreement that contained the settlement proposed by the inspection was signed, with no material differences
between the proposed settlement and the contingency calculated and provided for.

In Germany, an inspection procedure has been opened which is reviewing the amount of negative tax bases still
to be offset by the companies in Germany.

Another inspection procedure has been opened in Austria by the Austrian authorities who are checking the overall
tax position of the subsidiary in that country.

Finally, an inspection procedure has been opened in Colombia focused on the deductions of certain Corporation
Tax expenses.

The Group’s Directors do not expect any significant contingencies to arise from the conclusions of the inspections.

Regarding the financial years open to inspection in the rest of the group, contingent liabilities not susceptible to
objective quantification may exist, which are not significant in the opinion of the Group’s Directors. Moreover,
the company considers that there aren’t any significant uncertain tax positions.

**Total** **220,040** **138,724**

All these impacts have had an effect on the Consolidated Profit and Loss Statement except for the initial impact
from the first application of IFRS 16 and other non-significant ones that have resulted in changes to the
consolidated statement of changes in equity.

The increase in deferred tax assets is mainly due to IFRS 16 on leases being adopted in 2019 (See Note 2.1.1 and
Note 9).

Additionally, in 2019 there were assets recognised due to the activation of tax losses in Germany and Ireland
amounting to 1,857 and 70 thousand euros respectively, as a result of the positive results expected in future years.

The cancellation of assets is mainly due to the cancellation of tax losses to offset the positive tax bases generated
in 2019, in Luxembourg, Belgium, Germany and Latin America, amounting to 906, 94, 2,253 and 260 thousand
euros, respectively. Additionally, in Spain, at 31 December 2019, it has been updated the recovery plan for tax

credits, which back up the capitalization of such tax credits. As a consequence of the aforementioned, the Directors
of the Parent Company has decided to impair tax assets for 7,153 thousand euros. However, this impact has been
offset by the recovery during the year of part of the financial burden not deducted in previous years, which has
led to a less current tax expense in the Group.

Tax credits in Spain for 7,153 thousand euros were also cancelled as the recovery plan for tax credits prepared
by the Company did not support the asset for tax credits at that amount.

At 31 December 2019, the Group had assets resulting from tax losses and deductions amounting to 83,881
thousand euros (92,185 thousand euros in 2018). At 31 December 2019, the tax credit recovery plan that supports
the recognition of these tax credits had been updated. As a result of said update, and pursuant to that previously
stated, the Directors of the Parent Company decided to impair the asset by 7,153 thousand euros.

At 31 December 2019, the Group had tax loss carryforwards worth 594,222 thousand euros (593,041 thousand
euros at 31 December 2018) and deductions amounting to 27,695 thousand euros (27,020 thousand euros in 2018)
that had not been entered in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet because the Directors considered they
did not meet accounting standard requirements. These assets are grouped as follows (base amount):

Finance costs, which are not considered deductible in the Spanish corporate income tax when exceeding 30% of
the operating revenue of the tax group calculated in accordance with Article 16 of Law 27/2014 of 27 December,
on Corporate Income Tax, amount to 191,799 thousand euros in 2019 (256,170 thousand euros in 2018). There is
no deadline for offsetting non-deductible finance costs.

The variation in unrecorded credits in 2019 is mainly due to the fact that financial expenses in Spain were not
deducted in previous periods by application of the aforementioned regulations. The reduction of non-deducted
financial expenses is offset by the higher amount of negative tax bases not activated in Spain and the United
States. Pursuant to the above, in Spain tax credits activated for 7,153 thousand euros we cancelled, which
represents a 28,509 thousand euro increase in non-activated negative tax bases. To this, negative tax bases
generated by the Spanish Tax Group in 2019 for 9,724 thousand euros that have not been activated are added.

decreased by 1,177 thousand euros (see Notes 2.4 and 4.23).

**21.-** **INFORMATION ON DEFERRED PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS. THIRD ADDITIONAL**
**PROVISION. "DUTY TO REPORT" OF ACT 11/2013 OF 26 JULY**

Below is the information required by Additional Provision Three of Law 15/2010 of 5 July and modified according
to the Resolution of 29 January 2016, of the Institute of Accounting and Auditing, on the information to be
incorporated in the record of annual financial statements relating to the average period for payment to suppliers
in commercial transactions of Spanish companies.

The above information on payments to suppliers of Spanish companies refer to those which by their nature are
trade creditors due to debts with suppliers of goods and services. The table includes, therefore, the "Commercial
Creditors and Other Accounts Payable" item in current liabilities of the attached consolidated balance sheet at 31
December 2019 and 2018.

The average period for payment to suppliers has been calculated, as stated in the Resolution of 29 January 2016,
of the Institute of Accounting and Auditing, using the weighted average of the two ratios explained below:

   - Ratio of paid transactions: average payment period of transactions paid in 2019 weighted by the amount
of each transaction.

   - Ratio of transactions pending payment: average period between the invoice date and the end of the year
weighted by the amount of each transaction.

**22 - OTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES**

-----

The reduction in the balance of bank guarantees at 31 December 2019 compared to that at 31 December 2018 is
mainly due to the cancellation of the 6,000 thousand euro guarantee on obligations related to cash pooling
contracts or centralised treasury management with one bank entity.

Of the 30,371 thousand euros in bank guarantees, 24,327 thousand euros guarantee leasing contract obligations
and others related to the Group's usual operations in various countries, and 6,044 thousand euros issued in relation
to public bodies.

At 31 December 2019, the Group had taken out insurance policies to cover risks arising from damage to material
goods, loss of profits and third‐party liability. The capital insured sufficiently covers the assets and risks
mentioned above.

**Commitments to third parties**

`-` A Group company currently acts as co-guarantor for a syndicated loan granted by two banks to a
company with a minority shareholding in a Grupo NH company which at 31 December 2019 had an
outstanding principal of 15,742 thousand euros (equivalent to 17,685 thousand US dollars) and final
maturity on 22 January 2020.

`-` On 10 March 2006, the partnership agreement of the company which owns a hotel in the United
Kingdom was signed, of which a group’s company is a shareholder, under which, if the company
were to receive a purchase offer for 100% of its shares at market price, the group’s company could
be required to transfer the shares. However, the group’s company will have preferential acquisition
rights over the shares. At year-end, this group’s company has granted its partner a purchase option of
up to 5% of the share capital.

`-` Within the framework of new development projects in the normal course of business, in which Grupo
NH subsidiaries act as lessees or operators, the Group's parent company gives personal guarantees in
favour of third parties to secure its contractual obligations, often issue promissory notes in payment
of said obligations and agrees penalty clauses in case of breach of contract.

`-` Likewise, within the framework of the Group's financing, personal and real guarantees have been
granted to fulfil the obligations guaranteed under the financing agreements (see Note 16).

**Claims in process**

The Group's main contingent assets and liabilities on the date these consolidated financial statements were
drawn up, are set out below:

`-` NH Group appeared in the insolvency proceedings of Viajes Marsans, S.A. and Tiempo Libre, S.A.,

from the unsettled estate of Gonzalo Pascual Arias and Gerardo Díaz Ferrán, and in the voluntary
insolvency proceedings against Ms María Ángeles de la Riva Zorrilla, with the aim of reclaiming the
outstanding amounts. The Group also appears in the voluntary bankruptcy proceedings of Transhotel
and Orizonia as well as in other proceedings both nationally and internationally, and provisions the
accounts receivable in the consolidation annual accounts for the amounts considered unrecoverable.

`-` The owner of four properties in the Netherlands has claimed in court the payment of compensation
to a Dutch subsidiary because there was allegedly a change of the control situation in the year 2014,
which supposedly entitles him to claim a fine, according to the lease. The claim filed by the owner,
both in the first instance and on appeal, was dismissed in full. The same owner has instituted fresh
court proceedings alleging a change of control situation in 2018, which is pending resolution.

`-` A claim has been filed against a Grupo NH company in Germany due to the termination of two lease
agreements and claiming specific amounts, including damages.


-----

`-` A claim has been filed against a Grupo NH company in Italy due to the early termination of a lease
agreement; the ruling was unfavourable to the company's interests in the court of first instance and is
currently being appealed, although it is in judicial review currently in progress.

`-` An NH Group company in Italy has been sued with damages under a service provision contract
requested.

`-` A claim has been filed against two of the Group's companies seeking payment fees to rights
management from 1 January 2008 to 31 May 2013, in addition to an unspecified amount
corresponding to the period thereafter until a judgment is issued, plus interest and costs. The
procedure from both first instance and appeal has been resolved by setting an amount lower than the
one claimed, however, a judicial review has been filed, which is pending a hearing.

`-` On the occasion of the agreements reached in 2014 for the sale of the shares held by NH Hotel Group,
S.A in the company Sotogrande, S.A., Grupo NH agreed to subrogate to the position of Sotogrande,
S.A. for certain claims assuming all rights and obligations relating thereto, and are summarised as
follows:

        - Plaintiff in the proceedings against construction agents for construction defects in twentyfive homes and contractual liability.

        - Respondent in the process of claiming amounts from a real estate development due to
construction defects.

        - The company may be subject to a claim for amounts derived from an eventual administrative
claim.

`-` It filed an arbitration claim requesting the validity of the declaration of resolution to sell practised at
fifteen premises in San Roque, the decision on which was in favour of the Company's interests. To
the contrary, it filed for annulment of the award, which has been dismissed. The debtor company has
entered into insolvency proceedings and the company has requested the right to separate the premises
from the estate, and an agreement has been reached with the insolvency administration for the delivery
of the aforementioned premises, which is in the execution phase.

`-` A former shareholder of the NH Group has requested the annulment of certain resolutions adopted
by the Board of Directors, and the proceedings are currently in progress.

`-` With regard to the disputed amounts linked to an eventual indemnity due to the resolution of the
agreement with the previous Chief Executive Officer, amounts that have been entirely provisioned
during fiscal year 2019, it has been definitely resolved for an amount below the provisioned.

`-` As part of the contractual liability assumed by the NH Group in the 2013 hotel purchase contract, the
buyers informed the Group of the requirement to pay the Dutch Capital Transfer Tax. At 31 December
2019, the total amount of this tax, plus the corresponding default interest, was 11,900 thousand euros.
The purchasers submitted an appeal to the Dutch Treasury that was rejected and an appeal has been
filed with the Courts that is still pending resolution. The NH Group and the purchasers have reached
an agreement whereby NH assumes control of the judicial procedure and has agreed to pay 275,000
euros in compensation to the purchasers for the tax advice expenses they incurred.

The Directors of the Parent Company consider that the hypothetical loss incurred by the Group as a result of such
actions would not significantly affect the equity of the Group.


-----

**24.-** **LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN**

On 25 June 2013, the Company's General Shareholders Meeting approved a long-term share-based incentive plan
(“the plan”) for the NH Hotel Group SA's executives and employees, as follows:

The plan consisted of the grant of ordinary shares of NH Hotel Group, S.A. to the beneficiaries calculated as a
percentage of the fixed salary, according to their level of responsibility. The number of shares to be granted was
subject to the degree of fulfilment of the following objectives:

  - TSR (total shareholder return) at the end of each of the plan cycles, comparing the performance of NH
Hotel Group, SA shares with the following indices:

`o` IBEX Medium Cap

`o` Dow Jones Euro STOXX Travel & Leisure

  - EBITDA, discounting the amount corresponding to rentals compared annually with the forecasts of the
Company's strategic plan.

If the minimum degree of fulfilment established in the aforementioned objectives were not achieved, the plan
beneficiaries would not be entitled to shares under said plan.

The plan was aimed at a maximum of 100 beneficiaries. The Board of Directors, at the proposal of the CEO, may
include new members in the plan.

The plan had a total duration of five years, divided into three three-year cycles. The third and final cycle was
settled in the first half of the year with the delivery of 226,067 net shares at a fair value per unit of 4.55 euros. The
settlement of this plan was done net of tax.

On the other hand, the 2017 General Shareholders' Meeting approved the launch of a new Long-Term Incentive
Plan. This plan has a duration of five years, divided into three three-year cycles:

No. of Shares

Assigned at the No. of live

start of each shares at Value of the

cycle 31/12/2019 allocation

(Thousands) (Thousands) (Euros)

The first cycle began on 1/1/2017 (delivery in 2020 (in force)) 720.87 629.84 3.80

The second cycle began on 01/01/2018 (delivery in 2021 (in force)) 517.96 482.30 5.96

The third cycle began on 01/01/2019 (delivery in 2022 (in force)) 879.25 872.81 3.96

The difference between the total shares assigned at the beginning of each cycle and the live shares at 31 December
2019 are beneficiaries who left between the launch the year-end 2019.

This second plan has a very similar structure to the first; delivery of ordinary shares of NH Hotel Group, S.A. to
the beneficiaries calculated as a percentage of fixed salary, according to their level of responsibility.

The number of shares to be delivered shall be subject to the degree of fulfilment of the following four objectives:

`o` TSR (total shareholder return) at the end of each of the plan cycles, comparing the performance
of NH Hotel Group, S.A. shares with the STOXX® Europe 600 Travel & Leisure share index

`o` Revaluation of the Share

`o` Recurring Net Profit

-----

`o` Recurring EBITDA

The beneficiaries must remain in the Group at the end of each cycle, notwithstanding the exceptions deemed
appropriate, as well as achieving the minimum thresholds for each of the objectives.

The Board of Directors will be authorised to decide, before the start of each of the cycles, the effective
implementation thereof in accordance with the Group's financial position at the time. At the date of publication of
this report, all the cycles had been approved by the Board of Directors.

The maximum amount approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting for the three cycles of the second Plan is
16,200,000 euros.

The effect of these items on the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement for 2019 was 3,569 thousand
euros (3,275 thousand euros in 2018).

**25.4 Other operating expenses**

The detail of "Other Operating Expenses" of the consolidated comprehensive income for 2019 and 2018 is as
follows:

Thousands of euros

2019 2018

Leases (See Notes 2.1.1 and 9) 83,647 319,435

Outsourcing of services 125,194 118,307

Commissions and bonuses for customers 92,287 85,542

Costs associated with information technologies 41,001 38,339

Marketing and merchandising 24,574 26,556

Taxes, insurance and levies 27,737 26,307

Advisory services 15,547 16,614

Other external services 72,194 87,067

**624,175** **857,266**

In 2019, the Group experienced a higher level of activity in its hotel business, which led to an increase in some
operational expenses directly related to the level of activity, such as the supplies and laundry service, among
others. Also, the increase recorded in revenue per available room explains the increase in associated agency
commission expenses. However, savings were achieved in other items such as marketing and merchandising,
among others.

The heading on leases has reduced due to the new accounting on leases from the application of IFRS 16 (See Note
2.1 and Note 9). The expense recorded for this item in 2019 corresponds to the variable income of these contracts.
On the other hand, there is no significant lease expense for contracts with a duration of less than one year or that,
due to a reduced value, have ceased to be considered under IFRS 16.

During 2019 and 2018, the fees for account auditing and other services provided by the auditor of the Group's
consolidated annual accounts and the fees for services invoiced by the entities related to it by control, shared
ownership or management, were as follows:

consolidated financial statements for information purposes.

a) They carry on business activities from which they can earn income from ordinary activities and incur
expenses (including income from ordinary activities and expenses for transactions with other components
of the Group).

b) They obtain operating results that are regularly reviewed by the entity's highest decision-making
authority to decide on the resources to be allocated to the segment and to evaluate its performance.

public offer made by MHG Continental Holding (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. and caused, among others, the departure of
the Directors representing the shareholder Grupo Inversor Hesperia, SA, with Mr Jordi Ferrer Graupera on behalf
of the Director Grupo Inversor Hesperia, S.A. tendering his resignation on 12 November 2018 as a member of the
Appointments, Remuneration and Corporate Governance Committee At its meeting on 7 February 2019 the Board
of Directors approved the appointment of Mr Stephen Chojnacki as a new member of the Committee. This
appointment fulfils the composition and qualification requirements established in the Capital Companies Act.

Transactions, which are broken down in the Audit and Control Committee's Annual Report, as well as in Note 26
of this Report. These Related Party Transactions have always been executed in strict compliance with the rules
established in the applicable regulations and the Procedure for Conflicts of Interest and Related Party Transactions
with Significant Shareholders, Directors and Senior Management of NH Hotel Group, S.A. approved by the Board
of Directors on 26 March 2014. All transactions signed with Minor (and/or its group of companies) have counted
on a report from the Audit and Control Committee, have been signed under market conditions and with the
participation of external advisors, and in compliance with the provisions in the Framework Agreement signed
between the parties on 7 February 2019, which regulates, among others, the scope of action of the respective hotel
groups headed by NH and Minor through the identification of preferred geographic areas or zones, the mechanisms
necessary to prevent and deal with possible conflicts of interest, as well as to carry out operations with related
parties and develop business opportunities. The aforementioned Framework Agreement was duly communicated
to the Market via a Relevant Fact and is published in full on the Company's website.

During all Board Meetings dealing with issues related to Minor, the Proprietary Directors were absent when
dealing with said matters and therefore did not participate in the adoption of the corresponding agreement.

**29.-** **EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD**

On 22 January 2020, the last payment of a syndicated loan granted by two banking entities was paid to a company
in which an NH Group company is a minority shareholder. This company, which consolidates into the NH Group,
using the equity method had an outstanding principal of 15,742 thousand euros (equivalent to 17,685 thousand
dollars), thereby releasing the guarantees that had been granted for the fulfilment of payment of said loan.

In order to carry out such payment, the Group has made a contribution of 6,315 thousand euros (5,588 thousand
euros at 31 December 2019 (See Note 26)) corresponding to the proportional part of NH Hotel Group as a
guarantor.

At a date subsequent to the year-end, a claim against a Group company was filed; it is pending processing and in
no case will have a significant adverse effect.

**30.-** **INFORMATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY**

For the NH Hotel Group, environmental sustainability drives innovation, seeking to surprise our guests as well as
achieving efficiencies in the use of natural resources, particularly water and energy. In our responsible
commitment to the Planet, we work to minimise our impact on Climate Change, increase the efficiency of
resources and develop more sustainable services. All this minimises our environmental footprint with responsible
consumption of natural resources.

Continuity was given to the environmental achievements of recent years in 2019. Thus, compared to 2007, per
Average Daily Room energy consumption has been reduced by 31%, water consumption by 23% and our carbon
footprint by 61%. NH Hotel Group is committed to renewable energy, which reduces its carbon footprint. This
consumption of green energy, certified as renewable, is available in 99% of our consolidated hotels in Spain, Italy,
the Netherlands, France and Luxembourg, covering 67% of the total electricity consumed in Europe.

NH Hotel Group works with the ISO 14.001 environmental management system and ISO 50.001 for energy
efficiency in accommodation, catering, meetings and events. In total, the Company has 149 individual
sustainability certifications in hotels such as BREEAM, LEED, Green Key, Hoteles+Verdes, ISO 14.001
Environmental Management System and/or ISO 50.001 Energy Management System. These environmental
certifications are internationally recognised (ISO 14.001 and ISO 50.001) and those from the hotel sector itself
such as Hoteles+Verdes and Green Key are recognised by the GSTC (Global Sustainable Tourism Council). The
NH Hotel Group has reported its commitment to and strategy against climate change to CDP Climate Change
since 2010 and received a B in its annual ranking.


-----

It is also noteworthy that, in 2019, the NH Hotel Group became the first Spanish hotel company to establish
emission reduction targets that are scientifically validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) - a
leading alliance in the promotion of the business sector against climate change in which CDP, the United Nations
Global Compact, World Resources Institute and World Wide Fund for Nature are a part. With this formalisation,
the NH Hotel Group is committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 20% throughout its value chain before
2030. This objective marks the Company's roadmap towards a significant reduction in its activity’s carbon
footprint in the coming years, aligned with the purpose set in the Paris Agreement to limit the increase in the
global temperature to less than 2ºC, and join the efforts that are being made globally towards the transition to a
low carbon economy.

**31.** **EXPOSURE TO RISK**

The Group financial risk management is centralised at the Corporate Finance Division. This Division has put the
necessary measures in place to control exposure to changes in interest and exchange rates on the basis of the
Group’s structure and financial position, as well as credit and liquidity risks. If necessary, hedges are made on a
case-by-case basis. The main financial risks faced by the Group’s policies are described below:

**Credit risk**

The Group main financial assets include cash and cash equivalents (see Note 13), as well as trade and other
accounts receivable (see Note 14). In general terms, the Group holds its cash and cash equivalents in entities with
a high credit rating and part of its trade and other accounts receivable are guaranteed by deposits, bank guarantees
and advance payments by tour operators.

The Group has no significant concentration of third-party credit risk due to the diversification of its financial
investments as well as to the distribution of trade risks with short collection periods among a large number of
customers.

**Interest rate risk**

The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, which may have an adverse
effect on its results and cash flows. In order to mitigate this risk, the Group has established policies and has
refinanced its debt at fixed interest rates through the issuance of convertible bonds and guaranteed convertible
senior bonds. At 31 December 2019, approximately 81.3% of the gross borrowings was tied to fixed interest rates.

In accordance with reporting requirements set forth in IFRS 7, the Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on
possible interest-rate fluctuations in the markets in which it operates, based on these requirements.

Through the sensitivity analysis, taking as a reference the outstanding amount of that financing that has variable
interest, we estimated the increase in the interest that would arise in the event of a rise in the reference interest
rates.

If the increase in interest rates were 25 bp, the financial expense would increase by 219 thousand euros plus
interest.

If the increase in interest rates were 50 bp, the financial expense would increase by 438 thousand euros plus
interest.

If the increase in interest rates were 100 bp, the financial expense would increase by 876 thousand euros plus
interest.

The results in equity would be similar to those recorded in the income statement but taking into account their tax
effect, if any.

Lastly, the long-term financial assets set out in Note 11 of this annual report are also subject to interest-rate risks.


-----

**Exchange rate risk**

The Group is exposed to exchange-rate fluctuations that may affect its sales, results, equity and cash flows. These
mainly arise from:

`-` Investments in foreign countries (essentially Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, the
Dominican Republic, Brazil, Panama and the United States).

`-` Transactions made by Group companies operating in countries whose currency is other than the
euro (essentially Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic,
Venezuela, Brazil, the United States and the United Kingdom).

In this respect, the detail of the effect on the currency translation difference of the main currencies in 2019 was as
follows:

Thousands of euros

Currency

translation Changes with

difference respect to 2018

US dollar 3,296 321

Mexican peso (16,595) 1,807

Colombian peso (24,521) (1,688)

The changes in the currency translation difference of the above currencies was mainly due to the movements in
exchange rates between 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018:

Year-end euro reference

exchange rate 31/12/2019 31/12/2018 Change

US dollar 0.890150 0.873360 1.92%

Mexican peso 0.047120 0.044460 5.98%

Colombian peso 0.000270 0.000270        
As can be observed in the table, the movements in the exchange rate of the currencies with respect to the end of
the previous year is in line with the changes in equity associated with these currencies.

Below is a detail of the movements in the average exchange rate between 2019 and 2018 of the aforementioned
currencies:

Average euro reference

exchange rate in the year 2019 2018 Change

US dollar 0.893180 0.846630 5.50%

Mexican peso 0.046390 0.044040 5.34%

Colombian peso 0.000270 0.000290 (6.90%)

For these currencies an analysis was carried out to determine if it would be better to apply a monthly average or
cumulative average exchange rate, and no significant difference resulted from this analysis.

-----

**Liquidity risk**

Exposure to adverse situations in debt or capital markets could hinder or prevent the Group from meeting the
financial needs required for its operations and for implementing its Strategic Plan.

Management of this risk is focused on thoroughly monitoring the maturity schedule of the Group’s financial debt,
as well as on proactive management and maintaining credit lines that allow forecast cash needs to be met.

The Group’s liquidity position in 2019 is based on the following points:

`-` The group had cash and cash equivalents amounting to 289,345 thousand euros at 31 December
2019.

`-` Available undrawn credit lines amounting to 303,500 thousand euros at 31 December 2019, of
which 250,000 thousand euros relate to the undrawn guaranteed syndicated credit line maturing on
29 September 2021 (Note 16).

The capacity of the business units to generate positive cash flows from operations.

`-` The Group may increase its financial borrowing; given that it has non-collateralised assets and meet
the financial ratios required by the financing agreements.

Lastly, the Group makes cash flow forecasts on a systematic basis for each business unit and geographical area in
order to assess their needs. This Group liquidity policy ensures payment undertakings are fulfilled without having
to request funds at onerous conditions and allows its liquidity position to be monitored on a continuous basis.

###### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 To the Shareholders of NH Hotel Group, S.A.,

 Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements

 Opinion

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of NH Hotel Group, S.A. (the Parent) and
its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as
###### at 31 December 2018, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive
income, consolidated statement of changes in equity, consolidated statement of cash flows and
notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year then ended .

###### In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated equity and consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31
December 2018, and its consolidated results and its consolidated cash flows for the year then
ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union (EU-IFRSs) and the other provisions of the regulatory financial reporting
framework applicable to the Group in Spain.

###### ---- -----
 Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the audit regulations in force in Spain. Our
responsibilities under those regulations are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for
_the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section_ of our report.

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements, including those
pertaining to independence, that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial
statements in Spain pursuant to the audit regulations in force. In this regard, we have not
provided any services other than those relating to the audit of financial statements and there
have not been any situations or circumstances that, in accordance with the aforementioned audit
regulations, might have affected the requisite independence in such a way as to compromise our
independence.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion.

 Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most
significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these
matters.

###### ---------
 Other Information: Consolidated Directors' Report

The other information comprises only the consolidated directors' report for 2018, the preparation
###### of which is the responsibility of the Parent's directors and which does not form part of the
consolidated financial statements.

Our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the consolidated
directors' report. Our responsibility relating to the information contained in the consolidated
directors' report is defined in the audit regulations in force, which establish two distinct levels
thereof:

a) A specific level that applies to the consolidated non-financial information statement, as well
as to certain information included in the Annual Corporate Governance Report {ACGR), as defined
in Article 35.2.b) of Spanish Audit Law 22/2015, which consists solely of checking that the
aforementioned information has been provided in the consolidated directors' report, or, as the
case may be, that the consolidated directors' report contains the corresponding reference to the
separate report on non-financial information as provided for in the applicable legislation and, if
this is not the case, reporting this fact.


-----

b) A general level applicable to the other information included in the consolidated directors'
report, which consists of evaluating and reporting on whether the aforementioned information is
consistent with the consolidated financial statements, based on the knowledge of the Group
obtained in the audit of those consolidated financial statements and excluding any information
###### other than that obtained as evidence during the audit, as well as evaluating and reporting on
whether the content and presentation of this section of the consolidated directors' report are in
conformity with the applicable regulations. If, based on the work we have performed, we
conclude that there are material misstatements, we are required to report that fact.

Based on the work performed, as described above, we have checked that the non-financial
information described in section a) above is presented in the separate "consolidated non-financial
information statement for 2018" report to which a reference is included in the consolidated
directors' report, that the information in the ACGR, discussed in the aforementioned section, is
included in the consolidated director's report and that the other information in the consolidated
directors' report is consistent with that contained in the consolidated financial statements for
###### 2018 and its content and presentation are in conformity with the applicable regulations.

 Responsibilities of the Directors and Audit Committee of the Parent for the Consolidated financial Statements

The Parent's directors are responsible for preparing the accompanying consolidated financial
statements so that they present fairly the Group's consolidated equity, consolidated financial
position and consolidated results in accordance with EU-IFRSs and the other provisions of the
regulatory financial reporting framework applicable to the Group in Spain, and for such internal
control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

###### In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Parent's directors are responsible for
assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors
either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to
do so.

The Parent's audit committee is responsible for overseeing the process involved in the
preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements.


-----

###### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and
###### to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted
in accordance with the audit regulations in force in Spain will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements
is included in Appendix I to this auditor's report. This description, which is included below, forms
part of our auditor's report.

###### Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

 Additional Report to the Parent's Audit Committee

The opinion expressed in this report is consistent with the content of our additional report to the
Parent's audit committee dated 25 February 2019 .

###### Engagement Period

The General Meeting held on 21 June 2018 appointed us as the Group's auditors for a period of
one year from 31 December 2017, i.e. for 2018.

Previously, we were designated pursuant to a resolution of the General Meeting for the period of
one year and have been auditing the consolidated financial statements uninterruptedly since the
year ended 31 December 1993.

###### Appendix I to our auditor's report

Further to the information contained in our auditor's report, in this Appendix we include our
responsibilities in relation to the audit of the consolidated financial statements.

###### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

As part of an audit in accordance with the audit regulations in force in Spain, we exercise
professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

          - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
###### for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

      - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.

      - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Parent's directors.

      - Conclude on the appropriateness of the use by the Parent's directors of the going concern
basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required
to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future
events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

      - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

      - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities
###### or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group
audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.


-----

We communicate with the Parent's audit committee regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies
in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Parent's audit committee with a statement that we have complied with
relevant ethical requirements, including those regarding independence, and we have
communicated with it to report on all matters that may reasonably be thought to jeopardise our
independence, and where applicable, on the related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Parent's audit committee, we determine those matters
###### that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current
period and are therefore the key audit matters.

We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public
disclosure about the matter.

###### NH HOTEL GROUP, S.A. AND SUBSIDIARIES REPORT ON THE
 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR 2018


**1.-** **ACTIVITY AND COMPOSITION OF THE PARENT COMPANY**

NH HOTEL GROUP, S.A. (hereinafter the Parent Company) was incorporated as a public limited company in
Spain on 23 December 1981 under the trade name “Material para Ferrocarriles y Construcciones, S.A.”, which
was subsequently changed to “Material y Construcciones, S.A.” (MACOSA) and later to “Corporación Arco,
S.A.”

In 1992, Corporación Arco, S.A. took over Corporación Financiera Reunida, S.A. (COFIR), while at the same
time adopting the trade name of the company taken over and amending its corporate purpose to the new activity
of the Parent Company, which focused on the management of its shareholding portfolio.

During the 1998 financial year, Corporación Financiera Reunida, S.A. (COFIR) merged with Grupo Catalán, S.L.
and its subsidiaries and Gestión NH, S.A. through the absorption of these companies by the former. Subsequently,
Corporación Financiera Reunida, S.A. (COFIR) took over NH Hoteles, S.A., adopted its trade name and
broadened its corporate purpose to allow for the direct performance of hotel activities, activities in which it had
already been engaged indirectly through its subsidiaries.

Information on these mergers can be found in the financial statements of the years in which said transactions took
place.

The General Shareholders' Meeting of 21 June 2014 agreed to change the company's name from “NH Hoteles,
S.A.” to “NH Hotel Group, S.A.”

The Parent Company is the head of a group of subsidiaries engaged in the same activities and that constitute,
together with NH Hotel Group, S.A., the NH Hotels Group (hereinafter the “Group” – see Appendices I and II).

At the end of 2018, the Group was operating hotels in 28 countries, with 350 hotels and 54,374 rooms, of which
around 69% are located in Spain, Germany, Italy and the Benelux countries.

NH Hotel Group, S.A. has its registered address in Madrid.

**2.-** **BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND**

**CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES**

**2.1** **Basis of presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

The consolidated financial statements for 2018 were drawn up by the directors of NH Hotel Group, S.A. at the
Board meeting held on 25 February 2019, in accordance with the regulatory reporting framework applicable to
the Group, as established in the Code of Commerce and all other Spanish corporate law, and in the International
Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") adopted by the European Union in accordance with Regulation (EC) No.
1606/2002 of the European Parliament and in Law 62/2003, of 30 December, the Tax, Administrative, Labour
and Social Security Measures Act as well as in the applicable standards and circulars of the National Securities
Market Commission and the remaining Spanish accounting standards which may be applicable, and as such give
a true and fair presentation the Group’s equity and financial position at 31 December 2018 and of the results of
its operations, changes in equity and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended.

The consolidated financial statements for 2018 of the Group and the entities that it comprises have not yet been
approved by the shareholders at the respective Annual General Meetings or by the respective shareholders or sole
shareholders. Nonetheless, the directors of the Parent Company believe that said financial statements will be
approved without any significant changes. The consolidated financial statements for 2017 were approved by the
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 21 June 2018 and filed with the Companies Registry of
Madrid.

Since the accounting standards and valuation criteria applied in the preparation of the Group’s consolidated
financial statements for 2018 may differ from those used by some of its component companies, the necessary
adjustments and reclassifications have been made to standardise them and adapt them to the IFRS adopted by the

**2.1.1** **Standards and interpretations effective in this period**

In 2018 new accounting standards came into force and were therefore taken into account when preparing the
accompanying consolidated financial statements, but which did not give rise to a change in the Group’s
accounting policies:

**(1) New obligatory regulations, amendments and interpretations for the year commencing 01 January**

**2018.**

|Amendment to IFRS 4 Insurance contracts (published in September 2016)|It allows entities under the scope of IFRS 4 the option of applying IFRS 9 ("overlay approach") or their temporary exemption.||
|Amendment to IFRS 2 Classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions (published in June 2016)|Narrow-scope amendments clarifying specific matters such as the effects of vesting and non-vesting conditions in cash- settled share-based payments, the classification of share-based payments where there are net settlement clauses and some aspects of the modifications to terms of a share-based payment.||
|Amendment to IAS 40 Reclassification of real estate investments (published in December 2016)|The amendment clarifies that the reclassification of an investment from or to real estate investment is only permitted when there is evidence of a change in its use.||
|IFRS 22 Transactions and advances in foreign currency (published in December 2016)|This interpretation establishes the "transaction date" for the purpose of determining the exchange rate applicable in transactions with foreign currency advances.||
|Improvements to IFRS 2014- 2016 Cycle (published in December 2016)|Minor amendments to a number of standards (different effective dates, including 1 January 2017).||


These regulations and amendments have been applied to these consolidated financial statements without
significant impacts on either the reported figures or the presentation and breakdown of the information, either
because they do not entail relevant changes or because they refer to economic facts that do not affect the Group.

Specifically, on 1 January 2018, IFRS 15 came into force, which is the new comprehensive standard for
recognition of income with customers, and replaces standards and interpretations currently in force: IAS 18 on
Revenue from ordinary activities, IAS 11 on Construction Contracts, IFRIC 13 on customer loyalty programmes,
IFRIC 15 on agreements for the construction of real estate, IFRIC 18 on Transfers of assets from customers and
SIC 31 on Revenue/Barter transactions involving advertising services.

The new revenue model applies to all contracts with customers except those falling within the scope of other
IFRS, such as leases, insurance contracts and financial instruments.

The central recognition model is structured around the following five steps.

   - Identify the contract with the customer.

   - Identify the separate obligations of the contract.

   - Determining the price of the transaction.

   - Distribute the transaction price between the identified obligations.


-----

   - Account for the income when it fulfils the obligations.

Due to the Group's activity, as well as the relationships with its customers, the Parent Company's Directors
consider that no significant changes derive from its application in relation to the current record of the Group's
operations.

**(2) New regulations, amendments and interpretations which will be obligatory in the years following**

**the year commencing 01 January 2019**

The following standards and interpretations had been published by the IASB on the date the consolidated financial
statements were drawn up but had not yet entered into force, either because the date of their entry into force was
subsequent to the date of these consolidated financial statements or because they had not yet been adopted by the
European Union:

(1) The approval status of the standards by the European Union can be consulted on the EFRAG website.

(2) The date of first-time application of this standard is being reviewed by the IASB and may be postponed to 1 January 2022.

**(3) Analysis of IFRS 16 first application**

IFRS 16 will replace IAS 17, IFRIC 4, SIC-15 and SIC-17 IFRS 16 and establishes the principles for the
recognition, measurement, presentation and disaggregation of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases
under a balance sheet recognition model similar to the accounting for finance leases under IAS 17. IFRS 16 came
into force on 1 January 2019 and the Group decided not to apply it early.

The standard provides that at the inception of the lease, the lessee must record a liability equal to the present value
of the lease payments. Such a liability includes fixed lease payments and those that are substantially fixed, as well
as variable lease payments that depend on an index or interest rate. An asset that represents the right to use the
underlying asset during the lease term (the right of use) is recognised. Lessees are required to record separately
the interest expense of the lease liability from the amortisation expense of the right of use.

Lessees are also required to recalculate the lease liability in certain circumstances (for example, a change in the
term of the lease or a change in lease payments due to a change in the index or rate used to determine those
payments). The lessee shall recognise the difference from the recalculation of the liability as an adjustment to the
value of the right of use.

The lessor's accounting under IFRS 16 is substantially the same as under IAS 17. The lessor shall continue to
classify leases using the same criteria as under IAS 17 and distinguish between operating and finance leases.


-----

**Transition to IFRS 16**

The Group shall apply the standard to all contracts that were identified as leases in accordance with IAS 17 and
IFRIC 4, except for the exceptions recognised by the standard. These exceptions are as follows: leases of lowvalue assets (e.g. computers) and short-term leases (leases for periods of less than 12 months). Also, the Group
analysed the subleases signed at the transition date and, due to their amount and the applicable market conditions,
were not considered relevant for the application of the standard.

The Group decided to apply the modified retrospective method as the transition method to IFRS 16, calculating
the asset at the commencement date of each identified contract and the liability at the transition date, using for
the calculation of both the incremental interest rate at the transition date and recognising the difference between
the two items as an adjustment to the opening balance of the consolidated reserves.

In order to determine the term of the lease contracts, the Group has taken as non-cancellable the initial term of
each contract, taking the possible unilateral extensions at the option of the Group only in those cases in which it
has been reasonably considered certain that they will be exercised, and only the cancellation options whose
exercise has been reasonably considered certain have been taken into account.

The incremental interest rate is the interest rate that the lessee would incur at the commencement of the lease if it
borrowed, over a period of time, with similar guarantees and in a similar economic environment. The interest was
calculated as a combination of the following elements:

######  CDS curve of the economic environment.

  Euribor Swap Rate Curve.

  Synthetic NH CDS curve.

These elements were combined to obtain an interest rate curve for each contract based on its geoeconomic
specificities and from which, the calculation process consists of bringing each of the discounted flows to the
present value at the interest rate corresponding to each maturity within said curve and calculating which single
equivalent rate would be used to discount said flows.

The impact of IFRS 16 on the Group's financial statements is significant due to the maturity of the contract
portfolio.

Aforesaid estimated impact at 1 January 2019 will result in an increase in assets for usage rights of approximately
1.7 billion euros, an increase in liabilities for operating leases of approximately 2.1 billion euros and a decrease
in reserves of 0.4 billion euros. The Group is finalising the analysis of the first impacts of IFRS 16, and it is not
estimated that the finalisation of the same will result in an absolute difference of more than 10% with respect to
the aforementioned indicated impacts.

The calculation of these impacts has been performed as if IFRS 16 had been applied from the inception of each
contract or from the date of initial consolidation of the lessee of the contract. The calculation was made by
discounting the lease flows by recalculating the asset and liability for each material modification to the lease and
using an incremental interest rate calculated for each of the contracts at the transition date without taking into
account the tax effect.

In order to reconcile operating lease commitments in accordance with IAS 17 (see Note 24.5) with operating lease
liabilities in accordance with IFRS 16, it would be necessary to add to operating lease commitments according to
IAS 17 (approximately 2 billion euros) the impact of applying different discount rates (approximately 0.3 billion
euros) and subtract the impact of contracts signed but not in force at the transition date (approximately -0.2 billion
euros), thereby achieving an operating lease liability of approximately 2.1 billion euros.

The Group estimates that the net profit before tax will decrease by approximately 5 million euros, taking into
account the portfolio at the transition date, without considering additions, deletions or amendments to contracts
that might occur after that date.

**2.2** **Comparison of information**

As required by IAS 1, the information on 2017 contained in this consolidated annual report is presented for solely
comparative purposes with the information on 2018 and consequently does not in itself constitute the Group’s
consolidated financial statements for 2017.

During 2018, the economic crisis in Argentina worsened considerably, and this situation has led to a substantial
increase in the rate of inflation, which in the last three years has surpassed 100%. These events led Argentina to
be considered a hyperinflationary economy from 2018 onwards, in accordance with accounting standards. As a
result, the Group applied IAS 29 "Financial Information in Hyperinflationary Economies" to the Group's business
in Argentina, making the necessary accounting corrections as of 1 January 2018, in accordance with accounting
standards.

In accordance with IAS 29, the financial statements of an entity whose functional currency is that of a
hyperinflationary economy must be expressed in the unit of measurement current at the end of the reporting
period, based on the purchasing power of the closing month.

Given Argentina's consideration as a hyperinflationary country, the financial statements are adjusted for inflation
(see Note 4.23), the most significant impact being the restatement of non-current assets and liabilities from the
date of acquisition, last revaluation or first application of IFRS by the inflation index. The difference between the
pre-tax result and the net result corresponds to the recognition of deferred tax (see Note 18) for the adjustments
for inflation of net assets that, according to current tax legislation in Argentina, are not tax deductible.

The effect of the application of IAS 29 at 1 January 2018 led to an increase of 46 million euros in consolidated
reserves and an increase in the value of minority interests of 7 million euros, recorded mainly under "Property,
Plant and Equipment" (an increase of 71 million euros in net book value upon first application, see Note 8) and
under deferred tax liabilities (an increase of 18 million euros in the value of liabilities at the time of first
application, see Note 18).

After this first application, the impact of the application of IAS 29 during 2018 has had a negative net effect on
the reserves of consolidated companies amounting to 43 million euros. This is composed of the effect of the
devaluation of the currency that compensates for the increase in equity because of the restatement of nonmonetary items due to hyperinflation. On the other hand, "Property, plant and equipment" increased by 1.8 million
euros (see Note 8), and the deferred tax liability increased by 1.2 million euros (see Note 18) with respect to the
first application at 1 January 2018. Also, the net effect in the profit and loss account of the application of IAS 29
is recorded as income of 25,674 thousand euros, under the heading “Results from exposure to hyperinflation”
(IAS 29) in the 2018 consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement.

Additionally, the Group has decided to classify the historical translation differences associated with the
devaluation of the currency in Argentina to consolidated reserves. This has had a negative effect on the
consolidated reserves of 96,862 thousand euros and, therefore, the total effect of hyperinflation at the time of
first-time application amounted to lower reserves in fully consolidated companies amounting to 50,724 thousand
euros.

In addition, IFRS 9 on financial instruments entered into force on 1 January 2018. The Group has decided to apply
the standard without restating the comparatives, i.e., the difference between the previous book values and the new
values at the date of initial application of the standard (1 January 2018), were recognised as an adjustment in
reserves (equity).

During 2016, the Group renegotiated its financial liabilities (bonds and obligations) which, according to the
provisions of IAS 39, were considered non-material and consequently did not require derecognition of financial
liabilities. The treatment provided for by IFRS 9 requires recalculating the amortised cost book value of such
financial liabilities on the renegotiation date and recognising a gain or loss for the change in the results of the
period or at the time of applying the new standard. The impact calculated at 1 January 2018 was a decrease of 8.6
million euros in the book value of financial liabilities, which increased the amount of opening reserves at that


-----

date. In relation to the other requirements for the application of IFRS 9, the Parent's directors considered that there
were no significant impacts to be recorded by the Group as a result of their application.

**2.3** **Currency of presentation**

These consolidated financial statements are presented in euros. Any foreign currency transactions have been
recognised in accordance with the criteria described in Note 4.9.

**2.4** **Responsibility for the information, estimates made and sources of uncertainty**

The Directors of the Parent Company are responsible for the information contained in these consolidated financial
statements.

Estimates made by the management of the Group and of the consolidated entities (subsequently ratified by their
Directors) have been used in preparing the Group’s consolidated financial statements to quantify some of the
assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and undertakings recognised. These estimates essentially refer to:

        - Losses arising from asset impairment.

        - The hypotheses used in the actuarial calculation of liabilities for pensions and other
undertakings made to the workforce;

        - The useful life of the tangible and intangible assets.

        - The valuation of consolidation goodwill.

        - The market value of specific assets.

        - Calculation of provisions and evaluation of contingencies.

        - The recoverability of capitalised tax credits.

In spite of the fact that these estimates were carried out using the best information available at 31 December 2018
on events analysed, it is possible that events may take place in the future which compel their amendment (upwards
or downwards) in years to come. This will be done in accordance with the provisions of IAS 8, prospectively
recognising the effects of the change in estimate on the consolidated profit and loss statement.

**2.5** **Consolidation principles applied**

**_2.5.1 Subsidiaries (See Appendix I)_**

Subsidiaries are considered as any company included within the scope of consolidation in which the Parent
Company directly or indirectly controls their management due to holding the majority of voting rights in the
governance and decision-making body, with the ability to exercise control. This ability is shown when the Parent
Company has the power to direct an investee entity’s financial and operating policy in order to obtain profits from
its activities.

The financial statements of subsidiaries are consolidated with those of the Parent Company by applying the full
consolidation method. Consequently, all significant balances and effects of any transactions taking place between
them have been eliminated in the consolidation process. If necessary, adjustments are made to the financial
statements of the subsidiaries to adapt the accounting policies used to those used by the Group.

Stakes held by non-controlling shareholders in the Group’s equity and results are respectively presented in the
“Non-controlling interests” item of the consolidated balance sheet and of the consolidated comprehensive profit
and loss statement.

The profit or loss of any subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the financial year are included in the
consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement from the effective date of acquisition or until to the effective
date of disposal, as appropriate.


-----

**_2.5.2 Associates (See Appendix II)_**

Associates are considered as any companies in which the Parent Company has the ability to exercise significant
influence, though it does not exercise either control or joint control. In general terms, it is assumed that significant
influence exists when the percentage stake (direct or indirect) held by the Group exceeds 20% of the voting rights,
as long as it does not exceed 50%.

Associates are valued in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method; in other words, through
the fraction of their net equity value the Group’s stake in their capital represents once any dividends received and
other equity retirements have been considered. In the case of transactions with an associated company, the
corresponding losses or gains are eliminated in the percentage of the Group's stake in its capital.

The profit (loss) net of tax of the associate companies is included in the Group’s consolidated comprehensive
profit and loss statement, in the item "Profit (Loss) from entities valued through the equity method", according to
the percentage of the Group's stake.

If, as a result of the losses incurred by an associate company, its equity were negative, in the Group's consolidated
balance sheet it would be nil; unless there were an obligation on the part of the Group to support it financially.

**_2.5.3 Foreign currency translation_**

The following criteria have been different applied for converting into euros the different items of the consolidated
balance sheet and the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement of foreign companies included within
the scope of consolidation:

  - Assets and liabilities have been converted by applying the effective exchange rate prevailing at yearend.

  - Equity has been converted by applying the historical exchange rate. The historical exchange rate existing
at 31 December 2003 of any companies included within the scope of consolidation prior to the
transitional date has been considered as the historical exchange rate.

  - The consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement was translated at the average exchange rate
for the year, except for the companies in Argentina whose economy was declared hyperinflationary in
2018 and therefore, in accordance with IAS 29, their consolidated comprehensive profit and loss
statement was translated at the end-of-period exchange rate (see Note 4.23).

Any difference resulting from the application these criteria have been included in the “Translation differences”
item under the “Equity” heading (except for those arising from the translation of hyperinflationary economies).

Any adjustments arising from the application of IFRS at the time of acquisition of a foreign company with regard
to market value and goodwill are considered as assets and liabilities of such company and are therefore converted
using the exchange rate prevailing at year-end.

**_2.5.4 Changes in the scope of consolidation_**

The most significant changes in the scope of consolidation during 2018 and 2017 that affect the comparison
between financial years were the following:

**a.1** **Changes in the scope of consolidation in 2018**

**a.1.1 Additions to the consolidation scope**

On 5 July 2018, the Group acquired 16,693 shares with a par value of 60.1 euros/share of Grupo Palacio de la
Merced, S.A. for 1,000 thousand euros. The Group already had control of this company with an ownership interest


-----

of 72%; after the acquisition, the ownership interest amounts to 88%. The effect of the acquisition has been to
reduce the value of minority interests by 1,568 thousand euros and to improve consolidated reserves by 568
thousand euros (see Note 14.4).

In the first half of 2018, the Group acquired 23.53% of NH Logroño, S.A. for 500 thousand euros, and now owns
100% of this company; the effect on minority interests has led to a reduction of 578 thousand euros as a minority
interest (see Note 14.4) and higher consolidated reserves of 78 thousand euros.

**a.1.2 Disposals**

During the first six months of 2018, the Group liquidated Hotel&Congress Technology, S.L. and Hoteleira Brasil
LTDA, in which it held 50% and 100% of equity, respectively. The net result of these liquidations produced a
consolidated negative result of 40 and 45 thousand euros respectively.

In addition, in May 2018, the company belonging to the consolidated group Fast Good Islas Canarias, S.L. was
liquidated. This liquidation had no impact on consolidated profit for the year.

**a.2** **Changes in the scope of consolidation in 2017**

**a.2.1 Additions to the consolidation scope**

On 17 November 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Wilan Ander S.L. and Wilan Huel, S.L.,
as well as the assignment of the credit which the seller had with these companies. These companies owned the
properties operated by NH Hoteles España, such as the hotels NH Ciudad de Santander and NH Luz de Huelva,
until the date of taking control under the lease.

Said acquisition was carried out in accordance with that stipulated in IFRS 3 Business Combinations. The effect
of the acquisition on the consolidated financial position statement due to their fair values at 31 December 2017
was as follows:

The Group had granted subordinated loans amounting to 1,117 thousand euros to Wilan Ander, S.L. and 875
thousand euros to Wilan Huel, S.L. which the Group capitalised in the respective subsidiaries; the difference of
1,103 thousand euros corresponds to the Goodwill arising from the operation (see Note 6) and was recorded
against results.

**a.2.2 Disposals**

On 19 April 2017 the Group sold 400,000 registered shares making up the equity capital of the commercial
company Hesperia Enterprises de Venezuela, S.A. for 70,000 US dollars. The net result of the transaction was a
consolidated profit of 3 thousand euros. An expenditure of 5,785 thousand euros was also recorded owing to the
conversion differences associated with the aforementioned shareholding, which is entered in the net exchange
differences item of the abridged consolidated comprehensive results.

**_2.5.5 Intra-group eliminations_**

All accounts receivable and accounts payable, and transactions performed between subsidiaries, with associate
companies and joint ventures, and among each other, have been eliminated in the consolidation process.

**_2.5.6 Valuation uniformity_**

The consolidation of the entities included in the scope of consolidation has been performed based on their
individual financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with the Spanish General Accounting Plan for
companies resident in Spain and in accordance with their own local regulations for foreign companies. All
significant adjustments necessary to adapt them to International Financial Reporting Standards and/or
homogenise them with the accounting principles of the parent company have been considered in the consolidation
process.

**3.-** **PROPOSED DISTRIBUTION OF PROFITS**

The proposed distribution of the profit (loss) for the year prepared by the Parent Company's Directors and that
will be submitted for approval by the Shareholders at the General Shareholders' Meeting is as follows (in
thousands of euros):

2018

To legal reserve 16,019

To distribution of dividends 58,737

To voluntary reserves 85,436

**Total** **160,192**

In addition, the Parent's directors will propose offsetting prior years' losses on the Parent's balance sheet at 31
December 2018, amounting to 255,869 thousand euros, against voluntary reserves.

**4.** **VALUATION STANDARDS**

The main principles, accounting policies and valuation standards applied by the Group to draw up these
consolidated financial statements, which comply with IFRS in force on the date of the relevant financial
statements, have been the following:

**4.1** **Tangible fixed assets**

Tangible fixed assets are valued at their original cost. They are subsequently valued at their reduced cost resulting
from cumulative depreciation and, as appropriate, from any impairment losses they may have suffered.

Due to the transition to IFRS, the Group reappraised the value of some land to its market value on the basis of
appraisals made by an independent expert for a total amount of 217 million euros. The reappraised cost of such
land was considered as a cost attributed to the transition to the IFRS. The Group followed the criterion of not revaluing any of its tangible fixed assets at subsequent year-ends.

Enlargement, modernisation and improvement costs entailing an increase in productivity, capacity or efficiency
or a lengthening of the assets’ useful life are recognised as increases in the cost of such assets. Conservation and
maintenance costs are charged against the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement for the year in
which they are incurred.

Withdrawn assets and items, whether arising as a result of a modernisation process or due to any other cause, are
accounted for by derecognising the balances presented in the corresponding cost and accumulated depreciation
accounts.

The Group depreciates its property, plant and equipment following the straight line method, distributing the cost
of the assets over their estimated useful lives, in accordance with the following table:

Estimated years of useful

life

Buildings 33-50

Plant and machinery 10-30

Other plant, fixtures and furniture 5-10

Other fixed assets 4-5

These items are depreciated based on their estimated useful life or the remaining term of the lease, if this is less
than the useful life.

The profit or loss resulting from the disposal or withdrawal of an asset is calculated as the difference between the
profit from the sale and the asset's book value, and is recognised in the consolidated comprehensive profit and
loss statement.

**4.2** **Consolidation goodwill**

The goodwill generated on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's share
in the market value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary.

Any positive differences between the cost of interests in the capital of consolidated and associated entities and
the corresponding theoretical carrying amounts acquired, adjusted on the date of the first consolidation, are
recognised as follows:

1. If they are assignable to specific equity elements of the companies acquired, by increasing the value of
any assets the market value of which is above their carrying amount appearing in the balance statements.


-----

2. If they are assignable to specific intangible assets, by explicitly recognising them in the consolidated
balance sheet, provided their market value on the date of acquisition can be reliably determined.

3. Any remaining differences are recognised as goodwill, which is assigned to one or more specific cashgenerating units (in general hotels) which are expected to make a profit.

Goodwill is recognised only when it has been acquired for valuable consideration and represents, therefore,
advance payments made by the acquirer of the future economic benefits derived from the assets of the acquired
entity that are not individually and separately identifiable and recognisable.

Any goodwill generated through acquisitions prior to the IFRS transition date, 1 January 2004, is kept at its net
value recognised at 31 December 2003 in accordance with Spanish accounting standards.

At the time of the disposal of a subsidiary or jointly controlled entity, the amount attributable to the goodwill is
included when determining the profits or losses arising from the disposal.

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of companies with a functional currency other than the euro is valued in the
functional currency of the acquired company, with the conversion to euros being made at the exchange rate
prevailing at the balance sheet date.

Goodwill is not amortised. In this regard, at the end of every year, or whenever there are indications of a loss of
value, the Group estimates, using the so-called “Impairment Test”, the possible existence of permanent losses of
value that would reduce the recoverable amount of goodwill to less than the net cost recognised. Should this be
the case, it is written down in the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement. Any write-downs
recognised cannot subsequently be reversed.

All goodwill is assigned to one or more cash-generating units in order to conduct the impairment test. The
recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit is determined as the higher of the value in use and the fair value
less sale costs.

The value in use is considered as the current value of expected future cash flows discounted at an after ‐ tax rate
that reflects the current market valuation with respect to the cost of money and the specific risks associated with
the asset.

**4.3** **Intangible assets**

Intangible assets are considered to be any specifically identifiable non-monetary assets which have been acquired
from third parties or developed by the Group. Only those whose cost can be estimated in an objective way and
from which future economic profits are expected are recognised.

Intangible assets are initially recognised at acquisition or production cost and are subsequently measured at cost
less, as appropriate, their accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses they have suffered.

Any assets deemed to contribute indefinitely to the generation of profits are considered to have an indefinite
useful life. The remaining intangible assets are considered have a “finite useful life”.

Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised and are hence subjected to the “impairment test”
at least once a year (see Note 4.4).

Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortised according to the straight-line method on the basis of the
estimated years of useful life of the asset in question.

The following are the main items recognised under the “Intangible assets” heading:

i) Hotel Operating Rights: this item reflects, on the one hand, the right to operate Hotel NH Plaza de
Armas in Seville, acquired in 1994, amortisation of which is recognised in the consolidated


-----

comprehensive profit/loss over the 30-year term of the agreement at a rate which increases by 4%
each year. On the other hand, as a consequence of entering into the consolidation Hoteles Royal, S.A.,
operating rights of the hotel portfolio for 35 years were recognised within this concept.

ii) “Agreement premiums” reflect the amounts paid as a condition to obtain certain agreements. They
are amortised on a straight-line basis depending on the term of the agreement. This line item reflects
premiums from rental contracts. At the end of 2017, this heading included the premium for the
framework agreement signed with Grupo Inversor Hesperia, S.A. for the management of 28 hotels,
which ended in 2018 (see Note 7.1).

iii) “Concessions, patents and trademarks” basically reflect the disbursements made by Gran Círculo de
Madrid, S.A. for the refurbishment and remodelling of the building where the Casino de Madrid is
located. The amortisation of such works is calculated on a straight-line basis by taking into account
the term of the concession for operating and managing the services provided in the building where
the Casino de Madrid is located, which finalises on 1 January 2037. Furthermore, this item includes
the brands of the Grupo Royal with a useful life of 20 years.

iv) “Computer applications” include the costs incurred by the Group Companies in the acquisition and
development of various computer software programmes acquired by the different consolidated
companies. The amortisation of software applications is performed using the straight-line method at
a rate of 20-25% per year.

**4.4** **Impairment in the value of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill**

The Group evaluates the possible existence of a loss of value each year that would oblige it to reduce the carrying
amounts of its tangible and intangible assets. A loss is deemed to exist when the recoverable value is less than the
carrying amount.

The recoverable amount is determined as the value in use, with the sole exception of two cases, not significant in
the context of the assets as a whole, in which the valuation of an independent third party was used as the
recoverable amount. The value in use is calculated from the estimated future cash flows, discounted at a discount
rate after tax that reflects the current market valuation with respect to the value of money and the specific risks
associated with the asset, covering a five-year period and a perpetual value, except in the case of leased hotels
that correspond to the lease period, a perpetual value therefore not being considered in the latter.

As a general rule, the Group has defined each of the hotels it operates as cash-generating units, according to the
real management of their operations.

In the case of Hoteles Royal, S.A. which was purchased in 2015 the cash-generating unit corresponds to the Group
as a whole (Colombian, Chilean and Ecuadorian market).

For each CGU (hotel or Royal Group) the operating result is obtained at the end of the year without taking into
account non-recurring results (if any) or financial results.

Once the operating result is obtained for each CGU, the impairment test is performed for those in which there are
indications of impairment. Among others, the Group considers that a CGU has indications of impairment if it
meets the following conditions: it has negative operating results and its business is stable (that is to say, they are
not recently opened hotels until, generally speaking, they have been open for 3 years).

In addition, for all those CGUs in which impairment was recognised in previous years, an individual analysis and,
therefore, an impairment test is performed for them.

For the estimation of future cash flows, the baseline information is the result of the year approved by the Group’s
Management and the historical information relating to at least five previous years. The first projected year
corresponds to the budget approved by the Board of Directors for the year following the impairment test. The


-----

projections for the following years are consistent with the macroeconomic information from external information
sources and the knowledge of the business by the Group's Operations Department.

There are a number of factors that are considered by the Group's Management to make the projections, which are:

      - Estimate of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth issued by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
in its report published in October of each year for the next five years.

      - Knowledge of the business/asset/local situation of the local Management of each Business Unit to
which each CGU belongs.

      - Historical results obtained by the CGUs.

      - Investments in repositioning the CGUs.

These factors are reflected in the cash flows through the following working hypotheses used to obtain the
projections:

      - Income from accommodation is projected as the product of the occupancy percentage, the average
daily rate (ADR) per room, and the total available rooms per year.

      - The other revenues are projected based on the average of the relationship between the revenue from
accommodation and those revenues.

      - Staff costs are calculated based on the average staff costs with a growth in the inflation index (CPI).

      - For its part, tax is calculated from the tax rates applicable in each country.

      - Direct expenses are directly associated with each of the revenues and are projected on the basis of an
average ratio, while undistributed expenses are projected based on the average ratio between these
and direct expenses.

For the calculation of the discount rate the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) methodology has been
applied: Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), as follows:

WACC=Ke*E/(E+D) + Kd*(1-T)*D/(E+D)

Where:

Ke: Cost of Equity
Kd: Cost of Debt
E: Equity Amount
D: Debt Amount
T: Tax Rate

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is used to estimate the cost of equity (ke).

The main variables used to calculate the discount rate are as follows:

 - Risk-free rate: using the average long-term interest rates of a 10-year bond over the last 12 months for
each country, in the local currency.

 - Market risk premium: defined as 6.6% (6.7% in 2017), based on market reports.

 - Beta or systematic risk: Used as outside sources of information, this information is gathered from
independent databases and concerns the ratio between the risk of companies and overall market risk. The
re-leveraged beta coefficient has been estimated on the basis of 83% de-leveraged betas (64% in 2017),
the debt structure of comparable companies (Debt / (Debt + Equity) of 26% (31% in 2017) and the
corresponding tax rate in each country.

 - Market value of debt, amounting to 4.11% (5% in 2017).

 - Premium by size: based on recent expert reports.

The after-tax discount rates used by the Group for these purposes range in Europe from 6.2% to 9.0% (5.6% and
9.8% in 2017) and in Latin America from 10.6% to 18.4% (9.6% and 13.6% in 2017) without taking into account
Argentina, whose after-tax discount rate has been calculated taking into account its hyperinflationary economic


-----

situation (see Note 4.23) and varies between 36.5% in 2019 and 16% in 2023, depending on inflation
estimationset. In this regard, the cash flows resulting from the impairment tests were also calculated after tax. In
addition, the book value to which the value-in-use is compared does not include any deferred tax liabilities which
could be associated with the assets.

Using a post-tax discount rate and post-tax cash flows is consistent with paragraph 51 of IAS 36, which states
that "estimated future cash flows will reflect assumptions that are consistent with the manner of determining the
discount rate". In addition, the result of the post-tax flows updated at a post-tax discount rate would obtain the
same result with respect to the impairment test if a pre-tax rate were used and, therefore, the impairment and
reversion accounting records would be the same.

Below are the pre-tax discount rates of the major countries:

**Discount rate before taxes:**

**Germany** **Netherlands** **Italy** **Spain**

2018 7.81% 8.22% 11.01% 10.24%

###### I I I I

2017 6.88% 7.46% 9.44% 8.77%

If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be lower than its carrying amount, the latter is reduced to the
recoverable amount by recognising the corresponding reduction through the consolidated comprehensive profit
and loss statement.

If an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the limit of the
original value at which such asset was recognised before the loss of value was recognised.

Information on impairment losses detected in the financial year appears in Notes 7 and 8 of this Consolidated
Annual Report.

The evolution of the key assumptions in hotels with indications of impairment in the major countries in local
currency was as follows:

**2018** I 2017 **2018** I 2017 **2018** I 2017 **2018** I 2017

**Germany** **Netherlands** **Italy** **Spain**

Post-tax WACC 6.22% 5.55% 6.93% 6.00% 8.42% 7.30% 8.15% 7.14%

Growth rate 2.56% 2.47% 2.14% 1.60% 1.71% 1.40% 1.90% 1.56%

Average ADR 80.9 78.7 73.9 116.8 110.9 130.4 88.9 87.1

Occupancy rate 70.1% 66.3% 61.8% 69.8% 72.8% 70.7% 72.7% 70.9%

"Average Daily Rate" (ADR): is the quotient of total room revenue for a specific period divided by the rooms
sold in that specific period. This indicator is used to compare with companies in the sector the average prices per
room of the hotels.

As regards the ADR, the changes are affected by the type of the hotel that shows signs of impairment in each
year.

**4.5** **Lease rentals**

Leases are classified as financial leases whenever the terms of the lease assume that substantially all the risks and
benefits inherent in ownership of the leased asset are assumed by the lessee. All other leases are classified as
operating leases.

The Group generally classifies all leases as operating leases. Under IAS 17, whether a lease is financial or
operating depends on the economic background and nature of the transaction, rather than the mere form of the
lease agreement.

The arguments used to classify the leases as operative are as follows:

|Col1|Discount rate before taxes:|Col3|Col4|Col5|
|---|---|---|---|---|
||Germany|Netherlands|Italy|Spain|
|I 2018 2017|I 7.81% 8.22% I 11.01% I 10.24% 6.88% 7.46% 9.44% 8.77%||||

|Post-tax WACC Growth rate Average ADR Occupancy rate|2018|I 2017|2018|I 2017|2018|I 2017|2018|I 2017|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||Germany||Netherlands||Italy||Spain||
||6.22% 5.55% 2.56% 2.47% 80.9 78.7 70.1% 66.3%||6.93% 6.00% 2.14% 1.60% 73.9 116.8 61.8% 69.8%||8.42% 7.30% 1.71% 1.40% 110.9 130.4 72.8% 70.7%||8.15% 7.14% 1.90% 1.56% 88.9 87.1 72.7% 70.9%||


-----

   - The ownership of the asset is transferred to the lessor at the end of the lease;

   - There is no option to acquire the asset at the end of the lease;

   - The term of the lease does not exceed the economic life of the asset

   - The present value of the minimum lease payments does not substantially cover the market value of the
underlying asset;

   - The duration of leases is always much shorter than the economic useful life of the underlying asset;

   - In the event that it is decided to extend the duration of the lease, the terms of the new lease should be
renegotiated;

   - The group can unilaterally terminate the lease without a penalty being imposed as a consequence;

   - The increases or decreases in the residual value of the underlying asset are not borne by the Group, but
by the lessor.

**_4.5.1_** **_Operating leases_**

In operating lease transactions, ownership of the leased asset and substantially all the risks and rewards deriving
from ownership of the asset remain with the lessor.

When the Group acts as the lessor, it recognises the income from operating leases using the straight-line method
according to the terms of the agreements signed. These assets are recorded at the acquisition cost of the leased
assets under "Property, plant and equipment" and are depreciated in accordance with the policies adopted for
similar own-use tangible assets. When the Group acts as the lessee, the leasing costs are charged on a straightline basis to its comprehensive consolidated income statement, the resulting asset or liability being recognised
under “other non-current liabilities” and “other non-current assets” or “other current liabilities” and “other current
assets”.

**_4.5.2_** **_Finance leases_**

The Group recognises finance leases as assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at the start of lease
term at the market value of the leased asset or at the present value of the minimum lease instalments, should the
latter be lower. The interest rate established in the agreement is used to calculate the present value of the lease
instalments.

The cost of assets acquired under finance leases is presented in the consolidated balance sheet, according to the
nature of the leased asset being depreciated in accordance with the policies adopted for similar own-use tangible
assets or, where these are shorter, during the relevant lease term.

The financial expenses are distributed over the period of the lease in accordance with a financial criterion.
Contingent rent is recognised as an expense for the year in which it is incurred.

**4.6 Financial Instruments**

**_4.6.1 Financial assets_**

Financial assets are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when they are acquired and initially recognised
at their fair value. The financial assets held by Group companies are classified as follows:

   - Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are those assets acquired by the companies with the
objective of obtaining the contractual flows and selling them; or those assets that do not consist exclusively
of the payment of the principal and interest and the management model is the sale of the same, in general
terms, practically all of the variation in the fair value of the Group's financial assets are recorded with a
charge to the consolidated statement of changes in equity. Interest income, exchange rate differences and
impairment losses are recognised in the income statement and other gains or losses are recognised in "Other
comprehensive profit and loss" in equity. Any cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is reclassified to
profit or loss at the time of derecognition.


-----

   - Financial assets at amortised cost: assets whose contractual cash flows consist exclusively of principal and
interest payments and, if the management model of such assets is to hold them to obtain the contractual
flows. In this case, the Group records any changes in value with a charge to the consolidated comprehensive
profit and loss statement.

Transaction costs at the time of acquisition are recognised as an increase in acquisition cost or as an expense,
depending on whether the financial asset being transacted is considered at fair value through profit or loss.

Fair value of a financial instrument on a given date is construed as the amount for which it could be bought or
sold on that same date by two knowledgeable parties acting freely and prudently under conditions of mutual
independence.

Interest accrued on financial assets at amortised cost is recognised in the consolidated comprehensive profit and
loss statement on the basis of the effective interest rate. Amortised cost is construed as the initial cost minus any
collections or amortisation of the principal, taking into account any potential reductions based on expected loss.

As regards valuation corrections made to trade and other accounts receivable in particular, the criterion used by
the Group to calculate the corresponding valuation corrections, if any, generally consists of provisioning
according to the expected loss based on the credit risk of the customer portfolio.

The Group derecognises financial assets when the cash flow rights of the corresponding financial asset have
expired or have been transferred and the risks and rewards incidental to its ownership have been substantially all
transferred.

Conversely, the Group does not derecognise financial assets and recognises a financial liability for an amount
equal to the consideration received in the transfers of financial assets in which the risks and rewards inherent in
its ownership are substantially all retained.

**_4.6.2. Cash and cash equivalents_**

“Cash and Cash Equivalents” in the consolidated balance sheet includes cash, demand deposits and other shortterm, highly liquid investments that can be realised in cash quickly and are not subject to a risk of changes in
value.

**_4.6.3 Financial liabilities_**

**Issues of bonds and other securities**

Debt issues are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, less the costs directly
attributable to the transaction. They are subsequently valued at their amortised cost using the effective interest
rate method. Bonds with a maturity date greater than twelve months are classified under non-current liabilities,
while those with a maturity date of less than twelve months are included in current liabilities.

In the case of renegotiations, if they were considered non-substantial and consequently did not require the derecognition of the financial liabilities, the carrying amount of the amortised cost of those financial liabilities at
the date of renegotiation is recalculated and a gain or loss due to changes in profit or loss is recognised.

Convertible bond issues are recognised at the time of their issue, distributing the fair value of the consideration
received between their equity and liability components, assigning the residual value obtained after deducting the
amount established separately for the liability component, from the fair value of these instruments as a whole, to
the equity instrument. The value of any derivative embedded in the compound financial instrument other than the
equity component will be included in the liability component.


-----

**Bank loans**

Loans received from banking institutions are recognised at the amount received, net of costs incurred in the
transaction. They are subsequently valued at amortised cost. These costs incurred in the transaction and the
financial expenses are recognised on an accrual basis in the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement
using the effective interest rate method, and their amount is added to liabilities to the extent to which they are not
settled in the period they were produced.

In the case of renegotiations, if they were considered non-substantial and consequently did not require the derecognition of the financial liabilities, the carrying amount of the amortised cost of those financial liabilities at
the date of renegotiation is recalculated and a gain or loss due to changes in profit or loss is recognised.

**Trade and other payables**

Trade accounts payable are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently valued at amortised cost using
the effective interest rate method.

**Derivatives and hedge accounting**

Derivatives used to hedge the risks to which the Group’s operations are exposed, mainly exchange and interest
rate risks, are valued at market value on the date they are contracted. Any subsequent changes in their market
value are recognised as follows:

      - Concerning fair value hedges, the differences produced in both the hedging elements as well as in
the hedged elements (regarding the kind of risk hedged) are directly recognised in the consolidated
comprehensive profit and loss statement.

For cash flow hedges, valuation differences in the effective part of the hedge elements are temporarily recognised
in the equity item “Equity valuation adjustments” and their adjustment is recognised as a lower or higher cost in
the initial recognition of the item.

Hedge accounting is interrupted when the hedging instrument expires or is sold or finalised or exercised, or when
it no longer meets the hedge accounting criteria. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss corresponding to the
hedging instrument that has been recognised in equity is kept there until the expected transaction is undertaken.

When the transaction covered by the hedge is not expected to take place, the net cumulative gains or losses
recognised in equity are transferred to the profit or loss for the period. Any changes in the fair value of derivatives
which fail to meet hedge accounting criteria are recognised in the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss
statement as they arise.

Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or in other main contracts are recognised separately as
derivatives only when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the main contract and
providing such main contracts are not valued at fair value with changes through consolidated comprehensive
profit and loss.

**Valuation techniques and assumptions applying to the measurement of fair value**

The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows:

    - The fair value of financial assets and liabilities under standard terms and conditions which are traded
in active liquid markets are based on market prices.

    - The fair value of other financial assets and liabilities (excluding derivatives) is determined in
accordance with generally accepted valuation models on the basis of cash flow discounting using
the price of observable market transactions and contributor listings of similar instruments.


-----

    - In order to determine the fair value of interest rate derivatives, cash flow discounting is used based
on the implicit flow determined by the interest rate curve according to market conditions. In order
to determine the fair value of options, the Group uses the Black-Scholes valuation model and its
variants, using for this purpose market volatilities for the strike and maturity prices of said options.

Any financial instruments valued after their initial recognition at fair value are classified as level 1 to 3 based on
the extent to which fair value can be observed:

    - Level 1: includes any instruments indexed to listed prices (without adjustment) of identical assets
or liabilities in active markets.

    - Level 2: includes any instruments indexed to other observable inputs (which are not the listed prices
included under Level 1) for assets or liabilities, be it directly (i.e., prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived
from prices).

    - Level 3: includes any instruments indexed to valuation techniques, which include inputs for assets
or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

**_4.6.4. Equity instruments_**

An equity instrument represents a residual interest in the equity of the Parent Company once all its liabilities are
subtracted.

Equity instruments issued by the Parent Company are recognised in equity for the amount received, net of the
issue expenses.

**4.7 Non-current assets and associated liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations**

Assets and liabilities the carrying amount of which is recovered through a sale and not from continued use are
classified as non-current assets held for sale and liabilities associated with non-current assets held for sale. This
condition is considered to be met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate
sale in its current state, and it is estimated that the sale will be completed within one year from the date of
classification.

Non-current assets and associated liabilities classified as held for sale are valued at their historical cost, which in
all cases is less than their fair value less selling expenses. For the measurement of fair value, the investment book
value plus the amount of the existing unrealised gains of the assets owned by these companies, supported by
valuations carried out by independent experts, have been taken into account.

Discontinued operations represent components of the Group which will be disposed of. These components are
activities and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group, both operationally and for
the purposes of financial reporting, and represent lines of business or geographical areas which can be considered
as separate from the rest.

**4.8 Shareholdings in associated companies**

Investments in companies over which the Parent exercises significant influence or are jointly controlled are
accounted for using the equity method (see Appendix II). The carrying amount of the investment in the associate
includes the goodwill and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income includes the share in the results
of the associate's operations. If the associate recognises gains or losses directly in equity, the Group also
recognises its share in such items directly in equity.

At each year-end, the existence of indicators of a potential impairment of the investment in the associate is
assessed in order to recognise the related impairment loss, where appropriate In order to determine the reasonable
amount of the investments in companies whose sole asset consists of property inventories, appraisals were


-----

obtained from the same independent valuer that appraised the Group's inventories. In the case of the other
companies, discounted cash flow valuations were performed internally, similar to those described in Note 4.4.

**4.9 Foreign currency transactions and balances**

The Group’s functional currency is the euro. Consequently, any transactions in currencies other than the euro are
considered as “foreign currency” and are recognised according to the prevailing exchange rate on the date the
transactions are performed.

Cash assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted into the functional currency at the
prevailing exchange rate on the date of each consolidated profit and loss statement. Any gains or losses thus
revealed are recognised directly in consolidated comprehensive profit and loss.

**4.10** **Classification of financial assets and debts into current and non-current**

In the attached consolidated balance sheet, financial assets and debts are classified on the basis of their maturity;
in other words, those with a maturity date equivalent to or less than twelve months are classified as current and
those with a maturity date exceeding this are non-current.

**4.11 Income and expenses**

Income and expenses are recognised on an accrual basis, i.e. when the real flow of goods and services they
represent occurs, irrespective of the moment when the monetary or financial flows deriving from them arise.

More specifically, income is calculated at the fair value of the consideration to be received and represents the
amounts to be collected for the goods and services delivered within the ordinary framework of operations,
subtracting any discounts and taxes.

Income and expenses arising from interest are accrued on the basis of a financial timing criterion depending on
the outstanding principal to be received or paid and the effective interest rate that applies.

**4.12 Official subsidies**

Group companies follow the criteria set out below in recognising official subsidies:

  - Non-reimbursable capital subsidies (connected with assets) are valued at the amount granted, recognised
as deferred income and taken into profit and loss in proportion to the depreciation of the assets financed
by such subsidies during the financial year.

  - Operating subsidies are recognised as income at the moment of their accrual.

**4.13 Corporation tax**

The cost of the year’s corporation tax is calculated through the sum of the current tax resulting from applying the
tax rate to the taxable income for the year and then applying the relevant tax adjustments according to the law
plus any changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities include temporary differences, being any amounts expected to be payable or
recoverable due to differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities and their tax value, as
well as tax loss carry-forwards and any credits resulting from unapplied tax deductions. Said amounts are
recognised by applying to the relevant temporary difference or credit the tax rate at which they are expected to be
recovered or settled.


-----

In some countries, the tax rate varies depending on whether a transfer of assets is made. In these cases, the
Group’s policy consists of applying the effective tax rate at which they are expected to be recovered or settled. In
the opinion of the Parent’s Directors, the deferred tax thus calculated covers the amount which may eventually
be settled, if any, in the foregoing case.

Deferred tax liabilities for all taxable temporary differences are recognised, except for those in which the
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill amortisation of which is not tax-deductible
or the initial recognition of other operating assets and liabilities which do not affect either the tax or accounting
result.

Deferred tax assets identified as temporary differences are recognised only if it is deemed probable that the
consolidated entities will make sufficient tax profits in the future to realise them and they do not come from the
initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which does not affect either the tax or accounting
result. Other deferred tax assets (tax loss carry-forwards and tax credits) are recognised only if it is likely that the
consolidated companies will make sufficient tax profits in the future to be able to apply them.

At each year-end, deferred taxes (both assets and liabilities) are reviewed in order to verify that they remain in
force and the relevant corrections are made in accordance with the outcome of the analyses conducted.

**4.14 Obligations to employees**

Spanish hotel companies are obliged to make a specific number of monthly salary payments to those employees
who leave the company due to retirement, permanent disability or upon reaching a certain age and having a certain
number of years of service and fulfilling certain pre-established requirements.

In this regard and in compliance with Royal Decree-Law 16/2005, the Group has outsourced its pension
obligations for its employees' pension plans.

Also, in accordance with Italian law, employees of Italian companies have the right to compensation if they resign
or are dismissed.

Its obligations to personnel also include those arising from contracting pension funds for certain employees, which
in the Group, mainly affects the business units of Italy and the Netherlands.

Therefore, to provide for these obligations to future payments to personnel, the Group has recognised a liability
under “Provisions for Risks and Charges” (See Note 17).

**4.15 Onerous contracts**

The Group considers onerous agreements to be those in which the inevitable costs of fulfilling the obligations
they entail exceed the economic benefits expected from them.

The Group follows the principle of recording a provision at the present value of the aforementioned differences
between the costs and benefits of the contract, or the compensation foreseen for abandonment of the contract, if
such is decided.

The methodology, assumptions and discount rates used to calculate any necessary provisions are applied in
accordance with the criteria described in Note 4.4.

**4.16 Share-based Remuneration Schemes**

These schemes, which are settled in shares, are valued at the time of granting, using a financial method based on
a binomial model which takes into consideration the strike price, volatility, the exercise period, the expected
dividends, the risk-free interest rate and the assumptions made concerning the financial year.


-----

In accordance with IFRS 2, the above-mentioned valuation is recognised in profit or loss under personnel
expenses during the period established as a requirement for the employee to remain in the company before
exercising the option. Said value is recognised on a straight-line basis in the consolidated comprehensive profit
and loss statement from the date the option is granted until the date on which it is exercised.

On each subsequent closing date, the Group reviews the estimates regarding the number of options expected to
be exercisable, adjusting the equity figure if necessary.

**4.17 Treasury shares**

Pursuant to IAS 32, treasury shares are presented by reducing the Group’s equity. Treasury shares are recognised
at the value of the consideration paid and are deducted directly from equity. Gains and losses on the acquisition,
sale, issue or retirement of treasury shares are recognised directly in equity and in no case are they recognised in
the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement.

**4.18 Provisions**

The Group follows the policy of provisioning for the estimated amounts arising from ongoing litigation,
indemnities or obligations, as well as for any sureties or guarantees granted by Group companies which could
involve the Group in a payment obligation (either legal or implicit), provided the amount can be reliably
estimated.

Provisions are quantified based on the best information available on the position and evolution of the events that
cause them and are re-estimated at the end of each reporting period, being totally or partially reversed when these
obligations cease to exist or decrease.

Contingent liabilities, except in business combinations, are not recognised in the consolidated financial
statements, but are reported in the notes to the financial statements, in accordance with the requirements of IAS
37.

**4.19** **Severance pay**

In accordance with current employment regulations and certain employment contracts, the Group is obliged to
pay indemnities to employees who are dismissed under certain conditions. The Group recognised expenses of
5,751 thousand euros for this item in 2018 (12,632 thousand euros in 2017).

The consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2018 includes, pursuant to IFRS (IAS 37), a provision of 1,058
thousand euros for this item (6,429 thousand euros at 31 December 2017).

**4.20** **Business combinations**

Business combinations whereby the Group acquires control of an entity are accounted for using the acquisition
cost method, calculating goodwill as the difference between the sum of the consideration transferred, the noncontrolling interests and the fair value of any previous stake in the acquired entity, less the identifiable net assets
of the acquired entity, measured at fair value.

In the event that the difference between these items is negative, income is recognised in the consolidated
comprehensive profit and loss statement.

In the case of business combinations carried out in stages, goodwill is measured and recognised only once control
of a business has been acquired. To do this, previous holdings are re-measured at fair value and the corresponding
gain or loss is recognised.


-----

**4.21 Environmental policy**

Investments arising from environmental activities are valued at their original cost and capitalised as increases in
the cost of fixed assets or inventory in the financial year in which they are incurred.

Any expenses arising from environmental protection and improvement are recognised in the consolidated
comprehensive profit and loss statements for the year in which they are incurred, irrespective of the moment when
the cash or financial flows deriving from them arise.

Provisions for likely or certain liabilities, ongoing litigation and outstanding indemnities or obligations of an
indeterminate amount connected with the environment and not covered by the insurance policies taken out are
established at the time the liability or obligation linked to the indemnities or payment arises.

**4.22** **Consolidated cash flow statements**

The following terms with their corresponding explanation are used in the consolidated cash flow statement
prepared using the indirect method:

   - Cash flows: inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents, which are short-term, highly liquid
investments that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

   - Operational activities: the typical activities of the entities forming the consolidated group, along with
other activities that cannot be classified as investing or financing activities.

###### - Investing activities: the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included

in cash and cash equivalents.

###### - Financing activities: activities that result in changes in the size and composition of the equity and

liabilities that are not operating activities.

**4.23** **Treatment of companies in hyperinflationary economies**

In 2018, Argentina was declared a hyperinflationary economy due, among other causes, to the fact that the
accumulated inflation rate of its economy exceeded 100% over a continuous period of three years.

As a result, the Group has applied IAS 29 to the financial statements of Argentine companies with retroactive
effect from 1 January 2018. The application of this standard entails the following exceptions to what is stated
above in the rest of the valuation standards:

  - Restatement of non-monetary assets and liabilities net of deferred taxes, depending on the case, from
their acquisition date, date of first application of IFRS or date of last revaluation. The counterpart of this
restatement has been reserves or the result from exposure to changes in the purchasing power of the
year's currency depending on the period in which it is generated.

  - Equity effects: equity has been restated in the same way as the other non-monetary items; additionally,
the Group has decided to classify the historical translation differences associated with the devaluation of
the currency in Argentina to consolidated reserves.

  - The restatement of the monthly results of Argentine companies in accordance with the accumulated
inflation for the year since it was generated will be adjusted against the consolidated comprehensive
income derived from exposure to changes in the purchasing power of the currency.

  - Application of the closing exchange rate instead of the average exchange rate for the year to the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, in the case of Argentine companies. For this purpose,


-----

all amounts need to be restated using the variation experienced by the general price index from the date
on which expenses and income were recorded in the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss
statement.

**5.** **EARNINGS PER SHARE**

Basic earnings per share (EPS) are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to the Group in a period
by the weighted average number of shares in circulation during the period, excluding the average number of
treasury shares held during the same period.

In accordance with this:

31/12/2018 31/12/2017

Net profit for the year (thousands of euros) 117,785 35,489

Weighted average number of shares in circulation (in thousands) 369,873 340,805

At 31 December 2018, Goodwill was subject to an impairment test which showed 1,248 thousand euros of
impairment.

The basic assumptions used to estimate future cash flows of the CGUs mentioned above are detailed below:

      - After ‐ tax discount rate: 6.22% and 7.86% (5.55% and 6.93% respectively in 2017) for CGUs subject
to the same risks (German and Austrian market); and for Grupo Royal CGUs, rates of 14.64%
(Colombian and Ecuadorian markets) and 10.56% (Chilean market) (12.40% and 9.61% respectively in
2017).

      - Terminal value growth rate (g): 2.01% and 2.56% (2.67% and 2.25% in 2017) for Germany and Austria
and 1.22% and 3.04% (3% in 2017) for Grupo Royal CGUs.

Additionally, and considering the assumption implied in the preceding paragraph, the Group has conducted a
sensitivity analysis of the result of the impairment test to changes in the following situations:

"Average Daily Rate" (ADR): is the quotient of total room revenue for a specific period divided by the rooms
sold in that specific period. This indicator is used to compare with companies in the sector the average prices per
room of the hotels.

Scenario 1 is a negative one where the discount rate is raised 1 b.p. above the rate used in the test and a growth
rate lower by 1 b.p., i.e. with minimum growth, and falls in occupancy and ADR of 1% which would lead to an
additional impairment to that registered in 2018 for an amount of 3 million euros with respect to the goodwill of
NH Hotels Deutschland, Gmbh and NH Hoteles Austria, Gmbh, and 17.2 million euros with respect to the
goodwill of Hoteles Royal, S.A.

In the case of scenario 2, an impairment had been recorded for 99 thousand euros less than that recorded at 31
December 2018 with respect to the goodwill of NH Hotels Deutschland, Gmbh and NH Hoteles Austria, Gmbh,
and no impairment in regard to the goodwill of Hoteles Royal, S.A. was registered.

**7.1 Rental agreement premiums**

As a result of the change of control of the NH Group (see Note 14.1) on 30[th] November 2018, the effective
termination of all the management contracts defined in the framework contract entered into in 2017 with Grupo
Inversor Hesperia, S.A. ("GIHSA") was formalised, the latter being a former shareholder of the NH Group, for
the management of 28 hotels for a period of nine years, which until then had been managed by the NH Group as
this contract included an early termination clause in the event of a change of control of the NH Group.

As a result of this termination, the Group has de-recognised the net book value of the activated management
contracts amounting to 30.4 million euros. In the same way, a revenue of 33 million euros has been recorded
corresponding to the "Net Price Refund Amount" defined in the framework contract, which includes the receipt
of an advance indemnity revenue amounting to 20 million euros, the settlement of the pending payment by NH
related to the premiums for contracts amounting to 11,560 thousand euros, which was recognised under "Other
Financial Liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2017, and the sale of the Hesperia brand,
the net book value of which amounted to 45 thousand euros, for an amount of 1.4 million euros. The net effect of
2.6 million euros of revenue arising from the early cancellation of the contract entered into with GIHSA, before
its tax impact, is recognised under "Net result on disposal of assets" of the 2018 consolidated comprehensive profit
and loss statement.

**7.2 Software applications**

The most significant inclusions in the current year were in Spain, as a result of the investments made to develop
the corporate WEBSITE and implement front office systems of the hotels and IT transformation plan projects.

The derecognitions are mainly represented by withdrawals of software applications which were substantially
amortised at year-end.

During 2018, impairment provisions of 1,079 thousand euros and reversals of 712 thousand euros were recognised
under "Net Profits/(Losses) from asset impairment" of the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement.

The main additions and reductions in 2018 are due to the repositioning plan carried out by the Group, with
refurbishments in all Business Units. In Spain, the works at the NH Málaga and the new openings at the NH
Collection Gran Vía are noteworthy; in France the new openings at the NH Collection Marseille, in Italy the
refurbishment of the NH Porta Nuova and the new openings at the NH Venezia Rio Novo. In Central Europe, the
NH Berlin Alexanderplatz and NH Erlangen works in Benelux, the NH Conference Centre Koningshof and NH
Conference Centre Lewuwenhorst works as well as the acquisition of the NH Luxembourg, in Mexico, the NH
Collection Mexico City refurbishment, and in the United States, the beginning of NH New York Jolly Madison
Towers hotel refurbishment; in which, there have been de-recognition of assets arising from the start of these
works.

In 2017, the net additions for the year in the column "Changes in the scope of consolidation" come from the
purchase of the companies WILAN ANDER, S.L. and WILAN HUEL, S.L. (see Note 2.5.4) and the exit of the
company Hesperia Enterprises de Venezuela, S.A.

The column "Application of IAS 29" includes the cumulative impact of the restatement of property, plant and
equipment from the date of first application of IFRS or the date of last revaluation, with the changes in 2018 being
as follows:

Transfers to other items relate mainly to the second building of the NH Malaga classified as a non-current asset
held for sale in 2018 amounting to 12,562 thousands of euros (see Note 11).

At 31 December 2018, there were tangible fixed asset elements with a net book value of 237 million euros (275
million euros in 2017) to guarantee several mortgage loans (see Note 15).

The breakdown of impairment by country is as follows (in thousands of euros):

**Total impairment** **45,698** **47,007**

In 2018, impairment amounting to 10,034 thousand euros has been recognised for certain assets due to the
worsening of future expectations of cash flows for different reasons, including the opening of competitors' hotels
or the loss of an important customer (2,730 thousand euros in 2017), and 11,345 thousand euros registered under
"Net Profits/(Losses) from asset impairment" of the 2018 consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement
have been reversed.

During the year, various tangible and intangible assets were de-recognised, replaced or disposed of to third parties
outside the Group, the net effect being a loss of 1,333 thousand euros, recognised under "Gain/(loss) on the
disposal of non-current assets" in the 2018 consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement. In addition,
"Gain/(loss) on the disposal of non-current assets" includes the gain recognised on the sale of the NH Collection
Barbizon Palace classified as available for sale in 2018 (see Note 11).

The Group has taken out insurance policies to cover any possible risks to which the different elements of its
tangible fixed assets are subject, and to cover any possible claims that may be filed against it in the course of its
activities. It is understood that such policies sufficiently cover the risks to which the Group is exposed.

The main features of these agreements are as follows:

   - Hotel rentals are not subject to evolution of the inflation rate or to that of any other index.

   - The above-mentioned subordinated loans accrue interest at a fixed rate of 3% per year (2.13 million euros
in 2018 and 2.93 million euros in the preceding year).

   - Lease agreements establish a purchase right on properties subject to agreements that, as a general rule,
may be executed in the fifth, tenth and fifteenth year from the entry into force of the agreement.

   - The model used for these lease agreements has been analysed and independent experts consider them to
be operating leases.

The "Provisions" line item includes the provision recorded in 2017 amounting to 1,928 thousand euros,

These non-current financial investments are recorded at fair value.

**11.-** **NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE, LIABILITIES LINKED TO NON-CURRENT**
**ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS**

In accordance with IFRS 5, Non-current assets classified as held for sale and discontinued operations (see Note
4.7), the group has classified non-strategic assets under this heading which, pursuant to the Strategic Plan, are
undergoing divestment with committed sales plans.

The assets classified as held for sale, after deducting their liabilities, were measured at the lower of their carrying
amount and the expected sales price minus costs.

Specifically, Sotocaribe, S.L and Capredo Investments GmbH are classified as discontinued operations; these
companies represented the entirety of the Group’s property activity.

In addition, in 2017 the Group classified the property in which the NH Collection Barbizon Palace hotel is located
as non-current assets held for sale. This was sold in January 2018, resulting in a net asset de-recognition of 66,633
thousand euros and a positive pre-tax result of 87,315 thousand euros recorded under "Net result on disposal of
assets" in the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement.

Also, at 2018 year-end, the land and property in which the NH Málaga II hotel is located, the sale of which is
expected to take place at the beginning of 2019, was recognised as available for sale.

Sotocaribe, S.L. was consolidated by the equity method, while Capredo Investments, GmbH was changed to the
global method following the acquisition of the remaining 50% of the company by the Group Company on 28
December 2016.

**13.-** **CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS**

This item essentially includes the Group’s cash position, along with any loans granted and bank deposits that
mature at no more than three months. The average interest rate obtained by the Group for its cash and cash
equivalents balances during 2018 and 2017 was a variable Euribor-indexed rate. These assets are recognised at
their fair value.

There are no restrictions on the availability of cash, except for 2,207 thousand euros reserved in accordance with
a firm commitment with the co-owners of Hoteles Royal (1,716 thousand euros in 2017) for future investments in
the hotels.

As at 31 December 2018, there were no restrictions on the receipt of dividends distributed by the companies in
which the Parent Company holds a direct or indirect minority shareholding, except for the legally established
restrictions regarding the distribution of dividends.

As a result of the enactment of Royal Decree 1558/2012 of 15 November, of Article 42 bis of Royal Decree
1065/2007 of 27 July, approving the General Regulations on tax management, inspection and procedures, and
implementing the common rules of the procedures for applying taxes, which establishes certain reporting
obligations with regard to overseas assets and rights, among others, it is disclosed that some members of the NH
Hotel Group S.A. Board of Directors have the right, as representatives or authorised officials, to dispose of bank
accounts located abroad, which are in the name of Group companies. The reason certain Board members have the
right to dispose of overseas bank accounts is that they are directors or board members of said subsidiaries.

NH Hotel Group S.A. holds other accounting documents, namely the consolidated annual accounts, from which
sufficient data can be extracted in relation to the aforementioned accounts.

**14.** **EQUITY**

**14.1 Subscribed share capital**

On 5 June and 13 June 2018 deeds were registered for the conversion of convertible bonds (see Note 15) and
capital increase in which a total of 41,908,455 new ordinary shares were issued, each with a nominal value of 2
euros, in the context of the conversion of bonds convertible to NH Hotel Group, S.A. shares, which were issued
on 31 October 2013.

Due to this bond conversion and capital increase, the share capital of NH Hotel Group, S.A. came to 784,360,486
euros, divided into 392,180,243 ordinary shares of the same category and series, each with a face value of 2 euros
and fully subscribed and paid up. All these shares carry identical voting and economic rights and are traded on
the Continuous Market of the Spanish Stock Exchanges.

According to the latest notifications received by the Parent Company and the notices given to the National
Securities Market Commission before the end of every financial year, the shareholders with shareholdings above

**Changes in the shareholder structure and control of the Group:**

Between the months of May and September 2018, various purchase and sale contracts were entered into by Minor
International Public Company Limited ("MINT"), as buyer, and the HNA Group and with funds managed by
Oceanwood, all of which as sellers. As a result of these transactions, MINT acquired all the sellers' interests in
NH Hotel Group, S.A. In addition to these transactions, MINT acquired several non-significant shareholdings, as
a result of which on 30 September 2018 MINT owned 179,772,214 shares in NH Hotel Group, S.A., representing
45.84% of its share capital.

In parallel, on 11[th] June 2018, MHG International Holding (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. (a company wholly owned by
MINT) made a takeover bid ("OPA") for 100% of the shares that formed part of the share capital of NH Hotel
Group, S.A., which, once approved by the Spanish regulatory body, the "CNMV" (Spain’s National Securities
Market Commission), and the acceptance period was opened, was accepted, among others, by the hitherto
shareholder Grupo Hesperia.

As a consequence of the takeover bid, the result of which was notified by the CNMV through a significant event
on 26[th] October 2018, and of the purchase and sale transactions described above, (i) the funds managed by
Oceanwood, the HNA Group and the Hesperia Group lost their status as significant shareholders of NH Hotel
Group, S.A.; and (ii) MINT acquired, through its wholly-owned subsidiary MHG Continental Holding
(Singapore) Pte. Ltd., shares representing 94.13% of the share capital of NH Hotel Group, S.A.

The three proprietary directors representing the majority shareholder "Minor International PCL" do not hold a
personal interest in the parent company. By virtue of the foregoing, at 2018 year-end, the different members of
the Board of Directors owned or represented (by virtue of their status as proprietary) 94.16% of the share capital
of NH Hotel Group, S.A. At 31th December 2017, this percentage was 21.38%.

The main aims of the Group's capital management are to ensure short-term and long-term financial stability and
suitable funding for investments and indebtedness. All the above is geared towards ensuring that the Group
maintains its financial strength and the strength of its financial ratios, enabling it to maintain its businesses and
maximise value for its shareholders.

During recent years, the evolution of the business has allowed to reduce the ratio of accounting financial leverage

On 21 June 2018, the General Shareholders' Meeting approved the distribution of a dividend at 10 cents gross per
outstanding share, charged to 2017 profits and also to reserves. The total amount of dividends paid in 2018
amounted to 39 million euros.

**14.2** **Parent Company Reserves**

i) Legal reserve

In accordance with the Consolidated Text of the Corporate Enterprises Act, 10% of the net profit for
each year must be allocated to the legal reserve until it reaches at least 20% of share capital. The legal
reserve may be used to increase capital provided the remaining balance does not fall below 10% of
the increased capital amount. With the exception of the aforementioned purpose, and when it does
not exceed 20% of share capital, this reserve may be used only to offset losses, provided no other
reserves are available for this purpose.

At 31 December 2018 and 2017, the parent company's legal reserve was not fully constituted.

ii) Share premium

The Consolidated Text of the Corporate Enterprises Act expressly allows the balance of this reserve
to be used to increase capital and imposes no restrictions on its availability.

**14.3  Treasury shares**

At the end of the year, NH Hotel Group, S.A. had 600,000 treasury shares on its balance sheet, compared with
9,416,368 treasury shares at 31 December 2017. The reduction in treasury shares over the period can be explained
by the following movements:

  - In June 2018, the Group delivered 8,569,262 own shares to bond-holders for the early conversion of
convertible bonds worth 250 million euros. These include 1,384,473 shares held by one of the entities
participating in the loan of 9,000,000 shares associated with the issue, which has been definitively settled.

In 2018 the Group announced the early conversion, at the bondholders' choice, of the convertible bonds whose
execution period ended on 11 June 2018. The result of the early conversion was the delivery of 248.3 million
euros of the total nominal amount of 250 million euros to the bondholders who requested the early conversion.
This delivery was made by the Group through the delivery of 8.6 million treasury shares and 41.9 million newly
issued shares (see Note 14). Meanwhile, bond-holders who did not request early conversion received 1.7 million
euros face value plus the corresponding accrued interest.

Due to this conversion, the loan of 9,000,000 shares associated with the issue was permanently cancelled, and the
1,384,473 shares held by one of the entities participating in the loan of securities were returned; these shares were
used for the early conversion of the bond (see Note 14).

**Secured senior bonds maturing in 2023**

On 23 September 2016 the Parent Company placed guaranteed senior bonds, which mature in 2023, at the nominal
value of 285,000 thousand euros. The nominal yearly interest rate for said issuance of notes is 3.75%. On 4 April
2017, the parent company issued an extension of guaranteed senior bonds maturing in 2023 for a nominal amount
of 115,000 thousand euros with an implicit cost until maturity of 3.17%. The outstanding nominal amount at 31
December 2018 is 356,850 thousand euros (see the heading "Depreciation and Amortisation 2018" ).

"Depreciation and Amortisation 2018"

As a result of the change of control (see Note 14) and as established in the voluntary repurchase and early
redemption offer for the issue of senior secured bonds maturing in 2023 (the "Bonds") due to the change of control,
requests were received for the repurchase and redemption of bonds for a nominal amount of 3,150 thousand euros.

The bond repurchase offer was settled on 12 November 2018, the date on which the Company paid an aggregate
amount of 3,195 thousand euros to the bondholders, who accepted the offer as a whole:

- Nominal paid in advance: 3,150 thousand euros

- Unpaid accrued interest: 13.5 thousand euros

- Amount of the repurchase premium: 31.5 thousand euros

On 14 December 2018, the Company carried out the partial voluntary early redemption, for a nominal amount of
40,000 thousand euros (representing 10% of its original total amount), of the issue of senior secured bonds
maturing in 2023 (the "Bonds"), by means of a linear pro rata reduction of the nominal value of all the bonds in
circulation. The Bonds were redeemed early through the payment of approximately 103.760% of the nominal
value of the Bonds being redeemed, including:

- Nominal paid in advance: 40,000 thousand euros

- Unpaid accrued interest: 304.2 thousand euros

- Amount of the repurchase premium: 1,200 thousand euros

The Company paid the partial redemptions from available cash.

**Secured credit line**

On 22 September 2016, the Parent Company and NH Finance, S.A. entered into a revolving business credit with
credit institutions amounting to 250,000 thousand euros ("syndicated credit line") with a maturity of three years,
extendable to five years at the time of the refinancing of the guaranteed senior notes maturing in 2019. As a
consequence of the refinancing and early payments of the guaranteed senior notes maturing in 2019 which took
place in 2017, the maturity date of said financing was extended to 29 September 2021. At 31 December 2018, this
financing was not available.


-----

**Obligations required in the guaranteed senior note indentures maturing in 2023 and in the syndicated**
**credit line**

The senior notes maturing in 2023 and the syndicated credit line require the fulfilment of a series of obligations
and limitations of essentially homogeneous content as regards the assumption of additional borrowing or provision
of guarantees in favour of third parties, the granting of real guarantees on assets, the sale of assets, investments
that are permitted, restricted payments (including the distribution of dividends to shareholders), transactions
between related parties, corporate transactions and disclosure obligations. These obligations are detailed in the
issue prospectus for the aforementioned notes, as well as in the credit agreement of the syndicated credit line.

In addition, the syndicated credit line requires compliance with financial ratios; in particular (i) an interest
coverage ratio of > 2.00x, (ii) a debt coverage ratio of < 5.50x, and (iii) a Loan to Value ("LTV") ratio which, as
a result of the redemption of the 2019 senior secured obligations due in 2017, depends on the level of NH's net
indebtedness at any given time as indicated below:

- Net debt-to-income ratio ˃ 4.00x: LTV ratio = 70%

- Net debt-to-income ratios ≤ 4.00x: LTV ratio = 85%

- Net debt-to-income ratio ≤ 3.50x: LTV ratio = 100%

As a result of the early redemption of the convertible bonds and of the Group's reduced net debt-to-income ratio,
the maximum LTV permitted at 31 December 2018 is 100%.

At 31 December 2018 these ratios were completely adhered to.

**Package of guaranteed senior notes maturing in 2023 and syndicated credit line**

The guaranteed senior notes maturing in 2023 and syndicated credit line (undrawn at 31 December 2018) share
the following guarantees: (i) pledge of shares: 100% of the share capital of (A) Diegem, (B) Immo Hotel BCC

Additionally, there are assets granted as mortgage security against the syndicated credit line of 250,000 thousand
euros (undrawn at 31 December 2018) and guaranteed senior notes in the joint amount of 356,850 thousand euros,
maturing in 2023, can be broken down as follows (in thousands of euros):

**Fixed interest** **356,850**

**Variable interest (amount of the syndicated credit line undrawn)** **250,000**

**Limitation on the distribution of Dividends**

The guaranteed senior notes maturing in 2023 and the syndicated credit line described above contain clauses
limiting the distribution of dividends.

In the case of the senior notes maturing in 2023, the distribution of dividends is generally permitted provided that
(a) the interest coverage ratio is > 2.0x and (b) the sum of restricted payments (including dividends and repayment
of subordinated debt) made since 8 November 2013 is less than the sum of, amongst other items, (I) 50% of NH's
consolidated net income (even though in the calculation of net income, 100% of consolidated net losses must be
deducted) from 1 July 2013 to the date of the last quarterly accounts available (this is what is known as the CNI
Builder) and, (ii) 100% of the net contributions to NH’s capital from 8 November 2013.

Additionally, as an alternative and without having to be in compliance with the previous condition: (i) in the case
of bonds maturing in 2023, NH may distribute dividends provided that the leverage ratio (gross debt/EBITDA)
does not exceed 4.5x.

Finally, and also alternatively and without having to be concurrent with the previous ones, the notes maturing in
2023 establish a franchise to be able to make restricted payments (including dividends) without needing to comply
with any specific requirement, for a total aggregate amount of 25,000,000 euros as of November 2013.

In the case of the syndicated credit line, the distribution of a percentage of the NH Group’s consolidated net profit
from the previous year is allowed, provided that there has been no breach of the financing agreement and the Net
Financial Debt (through the Dividend payment) / EBITDA Ratio is less than 4.0x.

The maximum percentage of the consolidated net profit to be distributed will depend on the Debt Ratio.
Net Financial (through the payment of the Dividend) / EBITDA according to the following breakdown:

- Net Financial Debt / EBITDA ≤ 4.0x: Percentage of consolidated net profit: 75%

- Net Financial Debt / EBITDA ≤ 3.5x: Percentage of consolidated net profit: 100%

- Net Financial Debt / EBITDA ≤ 3.0x: Percentage of consolidated net profit: unlimited

-----

The Group records as a provision for onerous contracts the present value of the net losses derived from the contract
or the compensation foreseen for abandonment of the contract, if such were decided. These provisions are reversed
at the time that either of the above two events is fulfilled.

The reversal of the provision for onerous contracts for the year includes, on the one hand, the amount of the
provision overdue during the year, and on the other, the re-estimation of the necessary provision at the end of the
year. The part of the provision overdue in the year corresponds to the losses recorded by the CGUs in the income
statements, while the re-estimation of the provision is due to the improvement in the activity of the CGUs.

The methodology, assumptions and discount rates used to make such estimates follow the same criteria as
described in Note 4.4.

The reconciliation between the amount recorded in the income statement and the changes in the provision for
onerous contracts for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2017 is as follows:

**Total effect** **(3,417)** **(127)**

**Net effect** **(7,759)** **(4,343)**

**Provision for pensions and similar obligations**

The “Provisions for pensions and similar obligations” account mainly includes the pension fund of a certain
number of employees of the Netherlands business unit, and the T.F.R. “Trattamento di fine rapporto” in Italy, an
amount paid to all workers in Italy at the moment they leave the company for any reason. This is another
remuneration element, whose payment is deferred and annually allocated in proportion to fixed and variable
remuneration both in kind and in cash, which is valued on a regular basis. The annual amount to be reserved is
equivalent to the remuneration amount divided by 13.5. The annual cumulative fund is reviewed at a fixed interest
rate of 1.5% plus 75% of the increase in the consumer price index (CPI).

In addition, within this line, there are included various retirement and / or permanence prizes that are contemplated
in the Collective Labour Agreements which is applicable in Spain.

At the end of 2018, the liabilities entered against this item were of 16,740 thousand euros (16,245 thousand euros
at 31 December 2017).

**Other claims**

The "Other claims" item includes provisions for disputes and risks that the Group considers likely to occur. Among
the most significant are the provisions created on the basis of the action brought in the proceedings claiming
breach of contract in a property development, as well as other claims received in relation to the termination of
certain leases where certain amounts are claimed. No decision on these claims is expected in the short term (see
Note 22).

**18.- TAX NOTE**

**Tax consolidation scheme**

The Group operates in many countries and is therefore subject to the regulations of different tax jurisdictions
regarding taxation and corporate income tax.

NH Hotel Group, S.A. and another 17 companies with tax domicile in Spain in which it held a direct or indirect
stake of at least 75% during the 2018 tax period are subject to the tax consolidation scheme governed by Title
VII, Chapter VI of Law 27/2014 on Corporate Income Tax.

The companies belonging to the tax group have signed an agreement to share the tax burden. Hence, the Parent
Company settles any credits and debts which arise with subsidiary companies due to the negative and positive tax
bases these contribute to the tax group.

The companies that make up the tax consolidation group are the following:

NH Hotel Group, S.A. NH Europa, S.L.

Latinoamericana de Gestión Hotelera, S.L. Atardecer Caribeño, S.L.

NH Central Reservation Office, S.L. Hoteles Hesperia, S.A.

NH Hoteles España, S.A. Nuevos Espacios Hoteleros, S.A.

NH Hotel Ciutat de Reus, S.A. Coperama Holding, S.L.

Gran Círculo de Madrid, S.A. Coperama Spain, S.L.

NH Logroño S.A. NH Las Palmas, S.A.

Iberinterbrokers, S.L. NH Lagasca, S.A.

Wilan Ander, S.L. Wilan Huel S.L.

Corporation tax is calculated on the financial or accounting profit or loss resulting from the application of
generally accepted accounted standards in each country, and does not necessarily coincide with the tax result, this
being construed as the tax base.

In 2018, Spanish companies pay taxes at the general tax rate of 25% irrespective of whether they apply the
consolidated or separate taxation schemes. The foreign companies are subject to the prevailing tax rate in the
countries where they are domiciled. In addition, taxes are recognised in some countries at the estimated minimum
profit on a complementary basis to Corporation Tax.

The prevailing corporation tax rates applicable to Group companies in the different jurisdictions where the Group
has significant operations are as follows:


-----

**Country** **Nominal Rate** **Country** **Nominal Rate**

Argentina (1) 30.0% Romania 16.0%

Colombia (1) 33.0% Poland 19.0%

Chile 27.0% Switzerland 8.5%

Belgium 29.6% Czech Republic 19.0%

Panama 25.0% Luxembourg 18.0%

Brazil 34.0% Italy 24.0%

Mexico 30.0% Netherlands 25.0%

Uruguay 25.0% France 33.3%

Dominican Rep. 27.0% Portugal 21.0%

Germany 30.0%

(1) Jurisdictions in which there is a minimum taxable income.

**Financial years subject to tax inspection**

In accordance with Spanish tax legislation, the years open for review to the Consolidated Tax Group are:

**Tax** **Tax loss carryforwards**

Corporation 2015 to 2017

VAT 2015 to 2018

IRPF (personal income tax) 2015 to 2018

Non-resident Income Tax 2015 to 2018

During 2018, in Spain there were no open tax inspections in progress in relation to the taxes included in the
previous table.

In Germany, an inspection procedure has been opened which is reviewing the amount of negative tax bases still
to be offset by the companies in Germany.

Another inspection procedure has been opened in Austria by the Austrian authorities who are checking the overall
tax position of the subsidiary in that country.

Finally, an inspection procedure has been opened in Colombia focused on the deductions of certain Corporation
Tax expenses.

The Group’s Directors do not expect any significant contingencies to arise from the conclusions of the inspections.

Regarding the financial years open to inspection in the rest of the group, contingent liabilities not susceptible to
objective quantification may exist, which are not significant in the opinion of the Group’s Directors.

**Balances with Public Administrations**

The movements of the “Deferred tax assets” item in 2018 and 2017 were as follows:

Thousands of euros

2018 2017

**Opening balance** **137,996** **152,389**

Settlement of deductions (3,611) (5,353)

Others 2,504 (2,919)

**Total** **138,724** **137,996**

The recognition of assets is mainly due to the activation of tax losses in Germany and the Benelux amounting to
2,253 and 1,155 thousand euros respectively, as a result of the positive results expected in future years.

The cancellation of assets is mainly due to the cancellation of tax losses to offset the positive tax bases generated
in 2018, in Spain, Belgium and Germany, amounting to 2,456, 173 and 1,841 thousand euros, respectively.
Additionally, the cancellation of deductions in Spain has been made in the amount of 3,611 thousand euros as a
result of their use to offset the positive share resulting in 2018.

At 31 December 2018, the Group had assets resulting from tax losses and deductions amounting to 92,185
thousand euros (96,689 thousand euros in 2017). At 31 December 2018, the tax credit recovery plan that supports
the recognition of these tax credits had been updated. Given that the results of the tax credit recovery plan are
satisfactory, the Parent Company’s Directors have decided to maintain the tax credits recognised in the
consolidated balance sheet.

At 31 December 2018, the Group had tax loss carryforwards worth 593,041 thousand euros (605,591 thousand
euros at 31 December 2017) and deductions amounting to 27,020 thousand euros (28,030 thousand euros in 2017)
that had not been entered in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet because the Directors considered they
did not meet accounting standard requirements. These assets are grouped as follows (base amount):

The accumulated amount of financial expenses, which are not considered deductible in the Spanish corporate
income tax when exceeding 30% of the operating revenue of the tax group calculated in accordance with Article
16 of Law 27/2014 of 27 December, on Corporate Income Tax, amount to 256,170 thousand euros in 2018
(260,852 thousand euros in 2017). There is no deadline for offsetting non-deductible finance costs.

The changes in non-recorded credits in 2018 were mainly due to the fact that in Spain finance costs not deducted
in prior periods were deducted owing to the application of the aforementioned regulations, and losses and
deductions were offset against the profit generated in the year. In Germany finance costs were deducted and losses
which had passed the tax credit recovery test were recognised.

**Closing balance** **177,478** **167,433**

The reduction in deferred tax liabilities is mainly due to the reversal of impairment on revalued assets. In addition,
a deferred tax liability associated with the conversion of Argentina into a hyperinflationary economy has been
recorded, giving rise to the recognition of a deferred tax liability amounting to 19,231 thousand euros (see Notes
2.2. and 4.23).

Below is the information required by Additional Provision Three of Law 15/2010 of 5 July and modified according
to the Resolution of 29 January 2016, of the Institute of Accounting and Auditing, on the information to be
incorporated in the record of annual financial statements relating to the average period for payment to suppliers

Creditors and Other Accounts Payable" item in current liabilities of the attached consolidated balance sheet at 31
December 2018 and 2017.

The average period for payment to suppliers has been calculated, as stated in the Resolution of 29 January 2016,
of the Institute of Accounting and Auditing, using the weighted average of the two ratios explained below:

   - Ratio of paid transactions: average payment period of transactions paid in 2018 weighted by the amount
of each transaction.

   - Ratio of transactions pending payment: average period between the invoice date and the end of the year
weighted by the amount of each transaction.

Of these, 6,000 thousand euros guarantee obligations related to cash pooling contracts or centralised treasury
management with several banks and, therefore, their execution would be linked to breach by NH of those
contractual obligations.

Of the remainder, 23,345 thousand euros guarantee leasing contract obligations and others related to the Group's
usual operations in various countries, and 8,008 thousand euros issued in relation to public bodies.

At 31 December 2018, the Group had taken out insurance policies to cover risks arising from damage to material
goods, loss of profits and third‐ party liability. The capital insured sufficiently covers the assets and risks
mentioned above.

**Commitments to third parties**

`-` A Group company currently acts as co-guarantor for a syndicated loan granted by two banks to a
company with a minority shareholding in a Grupo NH company which at 31 December 2018 had an
outstanding principal of 17,268 thousand euros (equivalent to 19,685 thousand US dollars) and final
maturity on 22 January 2020.

`-` On 10 March 2006, the partnership agreement of the company which owns a hotel in the United
Kingdom was signed, of which a Grupo NH company is a shareholder, under which, if the company
were to receive a purchase offer for 100% of its shares at market price, the Grupo NH company could
be required to transfer the shares. However, the Grupo NH company will have preferential acquisition
rights over the shares. At year-end, this Grupo NH company has granted its partner a purchase option
of up to 5% of the share capital.

`-` Within the framework of the sale of a hotel, NH as a seller agreed to undertake the extension of the
aforementioned hotel, and agreed with the buyer a put option in favour of the buyer, NH being obliged
to accept the exercise of that option provided that certain conditions are met and for a price agreed
between both parties.

`-` Within the framework of new development projects in the normal course of business, in which Grupo
NH subsidiaries act as lessees or operators, the Group's parent company gives personal guarantees in
favour of third parties to secure its contractual obligations, often issue promissory notes in payment
of said obligations and agrees penalty clauses in case of breach of contract.

`-` Likewise, within the framework of the Group's financing, personal and real guarantees have been
granted to fulfil the obligations guaranteed under the financing agreements (see Note 15).

**Claims in progress**

The Group's main contingent assets and liabilities on the date these consolidated financial statements were
drawn up, are set out below:

`-` NH Group appeared in the insolvency proceedings of Viajes Marsans, S.A. and Tiempo Libre, S.A.,
from the unsettled estate of Gonzalo Pascual Arias and Gerardo Díaz Ferrán, and in the voluntary
insolvency proceedings against María Angeles de la Riva Zorrilla, in order to claim outstanding
amounts. The Group also appears in the voluntary bankruptcy proceedings of Transhotel and Orizonia
as well as in other proceedings both nationally and internationally, and provisions the accounts
receivable in the consolidation annual accounts for the amounts considered unrecoverable.

`-` The owner of four properties in the Netherlands has claimed in court the payment of compensation
to a Dutch subsidiary because there was allegedly a change of the control situation in the year 2014,
which supposedly entitles him to claim a fine, according to the lease. The Court of First Instance
dismissed in its entirety the claim brought by the owner. However, the owner has filed an appeal, the
subsidiary has submitted its allegations and the proceedings are ongoing in the aforementioned court


-----

pending a decision. The same owner has instituted fresh court proceedings alleging a change of
control situation in 2018, which is ongoing.

`-` The owner of a property has filed a suit against a Group company, demanding compliance with certain
contractual obligations. Following notification of the dismissal of the appeal, an appeal for review
due to breach of procedure and an appeal in cassation were lodged with the Supreme Court, in relation
to which a decision has been handed down that does not favour the interests of the Group, and it is
currently at the claim settlement stage.

`-` A claim has been filed against a Grupo NH company in Germany due to the termination of two lease
agreements and claiming specific amounts, including damages.

`-` A claim has been filed against a Grupo NH company in Italy due to the early termination of a lease
agreement; the ruling was unfavourable to the company's interests in the court of first instance and is
currently being appealed.

`-` A claim has been filed against two of the Group's companies seeking payment fees to rights
management from 1 January 2008 to 31 May 2013, in addition to an unspecified amount
corresponding to the period thereafter until a judgment is issued, plus interest and costs. In its ruling
on the case the Court of First Instance established an amount lower than that claimed. However, the
NH Group companies have filed an appeal.

`-` On the occasion of the agreements reached in 2014 for the sale of the shares held by NH Hotel Group,
S.A. in the company Sotogrande, S.A., Grupo NH agreed to subrogate to the position of Sotogrande,
S.A. for certain claims assuming all rights and obligations relating thereto, and are summarised as
follows:

    - Plaintiff in the proceedings against construction agents for construction defects in twentyfive homes and contractual liability, as well as a claim against the insurer, with which an
out-of-court settlement has been reached.

    - Defendant in the claim process for contractual breaches by a property developer, with an
out-of-court settlement having been reached.

    - The company may be subject to a claim for (i) amounts derived from an eventual
administrative claim; (ii) and/or constructive defects.

`-` It filed an arbitration claim requesting the validity of the declaration of resolution to sell practised at
fifteen premises in San Roque, the decision on which was in favour of the Company's interests. To
the contrary, it filed for annulment of the award, which has been dismissed. The debtor company has
entered into insolvency proceedings and the company has requested the right to separate the premises
from the estate, and an agreement has been reached with the insolvency administration for the delivery
of the aforementioned premises, which is in the execution phase.

`-` A former Grupo NH shareholder has requested that certain resolutions adopted at the General
Shareholders' Meeting be annulled. This claim was dismissed in the first instance and he withdrew it
in the appeal phase, leading to the termination of the proceedings.

`-` A former shareholder of the NH Group, different from the previous one, has requested the annulment
of certain resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors, and the proceedings are currently in progress.

`-` There are amounts related to possible compensation for the termination of a certain service contract,
which are under discussion and whose maximum amounts have been fully provisioned.

`-` As part of the contractual liability assumed by NH in the 2013 hotel purchase contract, the buyers
informed the Group of the requirement to pay the Dutch Capital Transfer Tax. At 31 December 2018,
the total amount of this tax, including interest, was 11.5 million euros. The buyers filed an appeal


-----

with the Dutch tax authorities, which was recently rejected. An appeal to the Dutch courts is currently
being considered. The Group's tax advisers consider that NH has sound defence arguments and,
consequently, no provision has been made for this.

The Directors of the Parent Company consider that the hypothetical loss incurred by the Group as a result of such
actions would not significantly affect the equity of the Group.

**23.-** **LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN**

On 25 June 2013, the Company's General Shareholders Meeting approved a long-term share-based incentive plan
(“the plan”) for the NH Hotel Group SA's executives and employees, as follows:

The plan consists of the grant of ordinary shares of NH Hotel Group, S.A. to the beneficiaries calculated as a
percentage of the fixed salary, according to their level of responsibility. The number of shares to be granted shall
be subject to the degree of fulfilment of the following objectives:

  - TSR (total shareholder return) at the end of each of the plan cycles, comparing the performance of NH
Hotel Group, SA shares with the following indices:

`o` IBEX Medium Cap

`o` Dow Jones Euro STOXX Travel & Leisure

  - EBITDA, discounting the amount corresponding to rentals compared annually with the forecasts of the
Company's strategic plan.

If the minimum degree of fulfilment established in the aforementioned objectives is not achieved, the plan
beneficiaries shall not be entitled to shares under said plan.

The plan is aimed at a maximum of 100 beneficiaries. The Board of Directors, at the proposal of the CEO, may
include new members in the plan.

The plan has a total duration of five years, divided into three three-year cycles:

  - The first cycle began on 1/1/2014 with delivery of shares in 2017 (settled)

  - The second cycle began on 01/01/2015 with delivery of shares in 2018 (settled)

  - The third cycle began on 1/1/2016 with delivery of shares in 2019 (in force)

The first cycle of the Plan (1/1/2014 - 31/12/2016), was settled during the first quarter of 2017 with an achievement
of 47.71%. The second cycle was settled in the first half of 2018, with 74.4% being complied with. Said
compliance was approved by the Board of Directors, and the number of shares to be delivered to each beneficiary
resulted from multiplying the number of shares promised by the degree of compliance with the objectives. The
maximum amount approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting for the current cycle of this plan is 4,400
thousand euros.

The 2017 General Shareholders' Meeting approved the launch of a new Long-Term Incentive Plan. The new plan
has a duration of five years, divided into three three-year cycles:

  - The first cycle began on 1/1/2017 with delivery of shares in 2020 (in force)

  - The second cycle began on 01/01/2018 with delivery of shares in 2021 (in force)

  - The third cycle began on 01/01/2019 with delivery of shares in 2022 (in force)

This second plan will have a very similar structure to the first; delivery of ordinary shares of NH Hotel Group,
S.A. to the beneficiaries calculated as a percentage of fixed salary, according to their level of responsibility.


-----

The number of shares to be delivered shall be subject to the degree of fulfilment of the following four objectives:

`o` TSR (total shareholder return) at the end of each of the plan cycles, comparing the performance
of NH Hotel Group, S.A. shares with the STOXX® Europe 600 Travel & Leisure share index

`o` Revaluation of the Share

`o` Recurring Net Profit

`o` Recurring EBITDA

The beneficiaries must remain in the Group on each of the plan settlement dates, notwithstanding the exceptions
deemed appropriate, as well as achieving the minimum thresholds for each of the objectives.

The Board of Directors will be authorised to decide, before the start of each of the cycles, the effective
implementation thereof in accordance with the Group's financial position at the time. At the date of publication of
this report, all the cycles had been approved by the Board of Directors.

The maximum amount approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting for the three cycles of the second Plan is
16,200,000 euros.

The effect of this incentive plans on the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement for 2018 was 3,275
thousand euros (2,809 thousand euros in 2017).

In 2018, the Group experienced a higher level of activity in its hotel business, which led to an increase in some
operational expenses directly related to the level of activity, such as the outsourcing of certain services,
maintenance and cleaning of the hotels and laundry service, among others. Also, the increase recorded in revenue
per available room explains the increase in associated agency commission expenses.

During 2018 and 2017, the fees for account auditing and other services provided by the auditor of the Group's
consolidated annual accounts, Deloitte, S.L., and the fees for services invoiced by the entities related to it by

During 2018, other auditing firms apart from Deloitte, S.L. or entities associated with this company by control,
shared ownership or management, have provided account auditing services to the companies making up the Group,
for fees totalling 66 thousand euros (83 thousand euros in 2017). The fees accrued in 2018 by these firms for tax
advice services were 209 thousand euros (125 thousand euros in 2017) and for other services, 396 thousand euros
(443 thousand euros in 2017).

**24.5 Operating Leases**

At 31 December 2018 and 2017, the Group had made undertakings concerning future minimal rental payments
by virtue of non-cancellable operating lease agreements, which expire as set out in the table below.

The current value of the rental payments has been calculated by applying a post-tax discount rate in keeping with
the cost of capital of each of the countries and includes the commitments which the Group estimates will have to
be met in the future to guarantee a fixed income or minimum return from hotels operated under a management
agreement.

**Total** **1,999,645** **2,349,450**

The term of the operating lease agreements signed by the Group ranges from 5 to 40 years. Agreements likewise
include several methods to determine the rent to be paid. Basically, the methods for determining rentals can be
summarised as fixed rentals indexed to a consumer price index; fixed rentals complemented by a variable part,
indexed to the property's operating profits; or completely variable rentals, determined by business performance
during the year. In some cases, variable rentals are set with a minimum profitability threshold for the owners of
the property under operation and sometimes this minimum threshold has a limit on payments made which restricts
the amount of minimum rents that would be paid.

**24.6 Finance costs**

The detailed balance of this chapter of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2018 and 2017 is
as follows:

Thousands of euros

2018 2017

Expenses for interest 30,860 44,220

Financial expenses for means of payment 17,379 16,317

Financial effect relating to restatement of provisions and other
financial liabilities 2,546 1,381

Amortisation of debt arrangement expenses 7,838 13,402

Other financial expenses 1,374 1,427

**Total financial expenses** **59,997** **76,747**

The decrease in interest expense in 2018 compared to 2017 is mainly due to the refinancing and repayment of
certain bonds during 2017, as well as the early repayments made in 2018. These effects have also led to a reduction
in the repayment of debt formalisation expenses.

**24.7 Results from exposure to hyperinflation**

This heading includes the net effect recognised in the consolidated comprehensive profit and loss statement arising
from the application of accounting standards to the financial statements of Argentine subsidiaries from the date
of first application at 2018 year-end.

**25.- RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

In addition to its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, the Group's “related parties” are considered to be the
“key management personnel” of the Parent Company (Board Members and Directors, along with their immediate
relatives), as well as organisations over which key management personnel may exert significant influence or
control.

Transactions carried out by the Group with its related parties during 2018 are stated below, distinguishing between
major shareholders, members of the Board of Directors and Directors of the Parent Company and other parties
which were related parties during the year even though they lost its condition of significant shareholder during
the year. The conditions of the related-party transactions are equivalent to those of transactions carried out under
market conditions:

**26.- INFORMATION BY SEGMENTS**

**26.1 Information on main segments**

The Group divides its activity into the real estate (see Note 11) and hotel segments. Additionally, within the hotel
segment, sub-segments are identified by geographic area, which are included in the breakdowns reflected in the
consolidated financial statements for information purposes.

The factors taken into account when defining the segments were as follows:

a) They carry on business activities from which they can earn income from ordinary activities and incur
expenses (including income from ordinary activities and expenses for transactions with other components
of the Group).

b) They obtain operating results that are regularly reviewed by the entity's highest decision-making
authority to decide on the resources to be allocated to the segment and to evaluate its performance.

c) They have different financial information.

The Management Committee is the body responsible for making decisions regarding the Group’s segments.
Accordingly, it analyses the Group’s results distinguishing between the aforementioned subsegments.

The breakdown of the segment information required by IFRS 8 is as follows:

**29.-** **INFORMATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY**

For the NH Hotel Group, sustainability drives innovation, seeking to surprise our guests as well as achieving
efficiencies in the use of water and energy. In our responsible commitment to the Planet, we work to minimise
our impact on Climate Change, increase the efficiency of resources and develop more sustainable products. All
this minimises our environmental footprint with responsible consumption of natural resources.

In 2018, the implementation of the sustainability initiative continued. This initiative gives continuity to the
environmental achievements of recent years. Thus, compared to 2007, per Average Daily Room energy
consumption has been reduced by 31%, water consumption by 27% and our carbon footprint by 67%. NH Hotel
Group is committed to renewable energy, which reduces its carbon footprint. This consumption of green energy,
certified as renewable, is available in 79% of our hotels in Spain, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and
Luxembourg, covering 90% of the total electricity consumed in Europe.

NH Hotel Group holds certificates ISO 14.001 for environmental management and ISO 50.001 for energy
efficiency in accommodation, catering, meetings and events. As well as the overall certificates held by the
company, 137 of its hotels hold certificates including BREEAM, LEED, Green Key, Hoteles+Verdes, ISO 14.001
and ISO 50.001, all recognised by the GSTC (Global Sustainable Tourism Council).

NH Hotel Group has reported its climate change commitment and strategy to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)
since 2010. In 2018, the Company obtained an A- rating on the Climate Index, placing NH Hotel Group among
the leading companies in the adoption of measures to effectively reduce emissions, which is indicative of advanced
environmental management. This result positions the company above the average for its sector and region.

Likewise, the NH Hotel Group forms part of FTSE4 Good, an index on the London Stock Exchange which
recognises the socially responsible behaviour of companies worldwide.

**30.** **EXPOSURE TO RISK**

The Group financial risk management is centralised at the Corporate Finance Division. This Division has put the
necessary measures in place to control exposure to changes in interest and exchange rates on the basis of the
Group’s structure and financial position, as well as credit and liquidity risks. If necessary, hedges are made on a
case-by-case basis. The main financial risks faced by the Group’s policies are described below:

**Credit risk**

The Group main financial assets include cash and cash equivalents (see Note 12), as well as trade and other
accounts receivable (see Note 13). In general terms, the Group holds its cash and cash equivalents in entities with
a high credit rating and part of its trade and other accounts receivable are guaranteed by deposits, bank guarantees
and advance payments by tour operators.


-----

The Group has no significant concentration of third-party credit risk due to the diversification of its financial
investments as well as to the distribution of trade risks with short collection periods among a large number of
customers.

**Interest rate risk**

The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, which may have an adverse
effect on its results and cash flows. In order to mitigate this risk, the Group has established policies and has
refinanced its debt at fixed interest rates, mainly through guaranteed convertible senior bonds. At 31 December
2018, approximately 87.7% of the gross borrowings was tied to fixed interest rates.

In accordance with reporting requirements set forth in IFRS 7, the Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on
possible interest-rate fluctuations in the markets in which it operates, based on these requirements.

Through the sensitivity analysis, taking as a reference the outstanding amount of that financing that has variable
interest, we estimated the increase in the interest that would arise in the event of a rise in the reference interest
rates.

In the event that the increase in interest rates were 25 b.p., the financial expense would increase by 134 thousand
euros plus interest.

In the event that the increase in interest rates were 50 b.p., the financial expense would increase by 269 thousand
euros plus interest.

In the event that the increase in interest rates were 1 b.p., the financial expense would increase by 538 thousand
euros plus interest.

The results in equity would be similar to those recorded in the income statement but taking into account their tax
effect, if any.

Lastly, the long-term financial assets set out in Note 10 of this annual report are also subject to interest-rate risks.

**Exchange rate risk**

The Group is exposed to exchange-rate fluctuations that may affect its sales, results, equity and cash flows. These
mainly arise from:

`-` Investments in foreign countries (essentially Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, the
Dominican Republic, Brazil, Panama and the United States).

`-` Transactions made by Group companies operating in countries whose currency is other than the
euro (essentially Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic,
Venezuela, Brazil, the United States and the United Kingdom).

In this respect, the detail of the effect on the currency translation difference of the main currencies in 2018 was as
follows:

|Col1|Thousands of euros|Col3|
|---|---|---|
||Currency translation difference|Changes with respect to 2017|
|US dollar Mexican peso Colombian peso|2,975 (18,403) (22,833)|249 2,362 (4,466)|


-----

The changes in the currency translation difference of the above currencies was mainly due to the movements in
exchange rates between 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2018:

Year-end euro reference

exchange rate 31/12/2018 31/12/2017 Change

US dollar 0.873360 0.833820 4.74%

Mexican peso 0.044460 0.042260 5.21%

Colombian peso 0.000270 0.000280 (3.57%)

As can be observed in the table, the movements in the exchange rate of the currencies with respect to the end of
the previous year is in line with the changes in equity associated with these currencies.

Below is a detail of the movements in the average exchange rate between 2017 and 2018 of the aforementioned
currencies:

Average euro reference

exchange rate in the year 2018 2017 Change

US dollar 0.846630 0.885190 (4.36%)

Mexican peso 0.044040 0.046890 (6.08%)

Colombian peso 0.000290 0.000300 (3.33%)

For these currencies an analysis was carried out to determine if it would be better to apply a monthly average or
cumulative average exchange rate, and no significant difference resulted from this analysis.

**Liquidity risk**

Exposure to adverse situations in debt or capital markets could hinder or prevent the Group from meeting the
financial needs required for its operations and for implementing its Strategic Plan.

Management of this risk is focused on thoroughly monitoring the maturity schedule of the Group’s financial debt,
as well as on proactive management and maintaining credit lines that allow forecast cash needs to be met.

The Group’s liquidity position in 2018 is based on the following points:

`-` The group had cash and cash equivalents amounting to 265,869 thousand euros at 31 December
2018.

`-` Available undrawn credit lines amounting to 312,192 thousand euros at 31 December 2018, of
which 250,000 thousand euros relate to the undrawn guaranteed syndicated credit line maturing on
29 September 2021.

The capacity of the business units to generate positive cash flows from operations.

`-` The Group’s capacity to increase its financial borrowing; given that it has non-collateralised assets
and meet the financial ratios required by the financing agreements.

Lastly, the Group makes cash flow forecasts on a systematic basis for each business unit and geographical area in
order to assess their needs. This Group liquidity policy ensures payment undertakings are fulfilled without having
to request funds at onerous conditions and allows its liquidity position to be monitored on a continuous basis.
