**Notice to Canadian Investors**

This offering memorandum does not address any Canadian federal, provincial or territorial income tax
considerations applicable to purchasers and beneficial owners of notes who are resident in Canada for Canadian
income tax purposes. There may be material Canadian federal, provincial or territorial income tax considerations
applicable to such purchasers and beneficial owners of notes. Such purchasers and beneficial owners should consult
their own tax advisors in this regard.

The notes may be sold in Canada only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal
that are accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1)
of the Securities Act (Ontario), and that are permitted clients, as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration
_Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the notes must be made in accordance_
with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian
securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for
rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a misrepresentation,
provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed
by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable
provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult
with a legal advisor.

Pursuant to section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (“NI 33-105”), the initial
purchasers are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding initial purchaser
conflicts of interest in connection with this offering memorandum.

**NOTICES TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**European Economic Area**

In addition to, and not abrogating in any way, the provisions set forth under “Notices to Certain European
_Investors—MiFID II Product Governance/Professional Investors and ECPs (as defined below) Only Target Market”_
and “Notices to Certain European Investors—PRIIPs Regulation / Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors”, this
offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the notes in any member state (each, a
“Member State”) of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) will be made pursuant to an exemption under the
Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. Accordingly, any person
making or intending to make an offer in a Member State of notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated
in this offering memorandum may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the issuer or any of
the initial purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation in relation to such
offer. Neither the issuer nor the initial purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of
notes in circumstances in which an obligation arises for the issuer or the initial purchasers to publish a prospectus for
such offer. The expression “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129, as amended from time to
time.

**MiFID II Product Governance/Professional Investors and ECPs (as defined below) Only Target Market**

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of any initial purchaser that considers itself as a
manufacturer pursuant to Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”) (each, a “Manufacturer” and, together, the
“Manufacturers”), the target market assessment in respect of the notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target
market for the notes is eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II and
(ii) all channels for distribution of the notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its
own target market assessment in respect of the notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.


-----

**PRIIPs Regulation / Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a person
who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within
the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “IDD”), where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in
point (e) of Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**United Kingdom**

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in the United Kingdom
will be made pursuant to an exemption under the United Kingdom Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the
“FSMA”) from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. Accordingly, any person making or
intending to make an offer in the United Kingdom of notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated in this
offering memorandum may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the issuer or any of the initial
purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant to section 85 of the FSMA in relation to such offer. Neither the issuer nor
the initial purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of notes in circumstances in
which an obligation arises for the issuer or the initial purchaser to publish a prospectus for such offer.

This offering memorandum is not being distributed by nor has it been approved for the purposes of section
21 of the FSMA. This offering memorandum may not be used for, or in connection with, and does not constitute, any
offer to, or solicitation by, anyone in any jurisdiction or under any circumstance in which such offer or solicitation is
not authorized or is unlawful. Consequently, this offering memorandum is for distribution only to, and is directed
solely at, persons who (i) are outside the United Kingdom, (ii) have professional experience in matters relating to
investments (being investment professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”)), (iii) are persons falling
within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.) of the Financial Promotion
Order, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning
of Section 21 of the FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of any notes may otherwise be lawfully communicated
or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This offering
memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant
persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this offering memorandum relates is available only to relevant
persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons. Any person who is not a relevant person should not act or
rely on this offering memorandum or any of its contents. No part of this offering memorandum should be published,
reproduced, distributed or otherwise made available in whole or in part to any other person without the issuer’s prior
written consent.

**UK MIFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market – Solely for the**
purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the notes has
led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA
Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No
600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”)
(“UK **MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are**
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the notes (a “UK distributor”) should take
into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a UK distributor subject to the FCA
Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”)
is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the notes (by either adopting or refining
the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**UK PRIIPs Regulation / Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who


-----

is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/565 as it forms part
of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and
any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 600/2014 as it forms part of
UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU)
2017/1129, as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”).
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, as it forms part of UK
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”), for offering or selling the notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

**LISTING**

Crown European Holdings intends to submit an application to list the notes on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to trade the notes on the Euro MTF. If Crown European Holdings submits such
application, there can be no guarantee that the application will be approved and the notes will be accepted for listing
as of the settlement date for the notes or at any time thereafter, and settlement of the notes is not conditional on
obtaining this admission to trading. In the course of any review by the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, we may be
requested to make changes to the financial and other information included in this offering memorandum. Comments
by the competent authority may require significant modification or reformulation of information contained in this
offering memorandum or may require the inclusion of additional information, including additional financial
information in respect of Crown European Holdings or the guarantors. We may also be required to update the
information in this offering memorandum to reflect changes in our business, financial condition or results of operations
and prospects. We cannot guarantee that our application to list the notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and for admission of the notes to trading on the Euro MTF will be approved as of the issue date for the
notes or any date thereafter, and settlement of the notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing. Each prospective
purchaser of the notes must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction in which it
purchases, offers or sells the notes and must obtain any consent, approval or permission required by it for the purchase,
offer or sale by it of the notes under the laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which it is subject or in
which it makes such purchases, offers or sales, and neither we nor the initial purchasers shall have any responsibility
therefor.

**MARKETS, RANKING AND OTHER DATA**

The data included in this offering memorandum regarding markets and ranking, including the position of
Crown and Crown’s competitors within these markets, are based on independent industry publications, reports of
government agencies or other published industry sources and the estimates of Crown based on its management’s
knowledge and experience in the markets in which it operates. Crown’s estimates have been based on information
obtained from customers, suppliers, trade and business organizations and other contacts in the markets in which it
operates. Industry publications and surveys generally state that they have obtained information from sources believed
to be reliable, but do not guarantee the accuracy and completeness of such information. While Crown believes that
each of these studies and publications is reliable, neither Crown nor the initial purchasers have independently verified
such data and neither Crown nor the initial purchasers make any representation as to the accuracy of such information.
Similarly, Crown believes its internal research is reliable but it has not been verified by any independent sources. The
issuer is responsible for the information contained in this offering memorandum. The issuer, having taken all
reasonable care to ensure that such is the case, confirms that, to the best of its knowledge as of the date of this offering
memorandum, the information contained in this offering memorandum is in accordance with the facts and contains
no omission likely to affect its import.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF LIABILITIES**

Crown European Holdings and certain guarantors are organized and established under the laws of France and
have their registered and principal place of business in France. The indenture governing the notes and the guarantees
will be governed by New York law. Certain directors and executive officers of the issuer and the French guarantors
may be non-residents of the United States and a substantial portion of their assets is located outside of the United
States.

As a result, any judgment obtained in the United States against the issuer and the French guarantors, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the notes or any judgment of a
U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the
United States.

Furthermore, although the issuer and the French guarantors will appoint an agent for service of process in the
United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any action in
relation to the notes and the indenture governing the notes or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for
investors to effect service of process on the issuer or the directors and the executive officers mentioned above within
the United States or to enforce, in courts outside of the United States, judgments against those persons obtained in


-----

United States courts, whether or not based upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United
States.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the issuer or the French guarantors, investors will need to
enforce such judgment in France. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments in France is described below,
you should consult with your own advisors as needed to enforce a judgment in France or elsewhere outside the United
States.

France has signed and ratified the Convention of July 2, 2019 on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign
Judgments in Civil or Commercial Matters (the “2019 Hague Convention”). The United States signed the 2019 Hague
Convention on March 2, 2022. The United States has not however ratified the Convention yet which is therefore not
applicable as of the date of this offering memorandum. It could become applicable in the future and you should consult
with your advisors in due course. While the 2019 Hague Convention outlines the circumstances under which a judge
may refuse to recognize and enforce a foreign judgement in more detail, in comparison to the grounds of refusal
currently applied by French Courts in determining whether or not a judgement issued in the United States can be
recognized and enforced in France, the substance of those grounds remains similar.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, the United States and France are not parties to a treaty that
would be in force and applicable between them and would provide for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state
court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, enforceable
in the United States, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate recognition and enforcement proceedings
_(exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal judiciaire) which has exclusive jurisdiction over the_
matter.

Recognition and enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e.,
adversarial) proceedings if the competent French court is satisfied that the following cumulative conditions have been
met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law as of the date of this offering memorandum, do not include
a review by the French courts of the merits of the foreign judgment):

    - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter (the dispute is clearly
connected to the United States (i.e., there was no international forum shopping), the choice of the U.S.
court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter); and

    - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the
merits and to the procedure of the case, including principles of due process and notably the right for a
fair trial; and

    - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law.

In addition to the above conditions that are specific to the enforcement of foreign judgments, the following
conditions must also be met: (i) the U.S. judgment must be final and enforceable in the jurisdiction of the court which
rendered it, (ii) the U.S. judgment does not conflict with a French judgment or foreign judgment which has become
effective in France (res judicata) and (iii) there shall be no proceedings pending before French courts at the time
enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment.

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res
judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in France.
However, the decision granting the exequatur can be appealed.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under
certain circumstances by French criminal law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80-538 of
July 16, 1980, French Decree n°2022-207 of February 18, 2022 and French Order of March 7, 2022 (relating to the


-----

communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature
to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons
in connection with a U.S. judicial or administrative action or in contemplation thereof. Pursuant to the regulations
mentioned above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the
Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons.

Similarly, French law No. 2018-670 of July 30, 2018 for the protection of trade secrets as well as French and
European data protection rules (law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual
liberties, as recently modified, and Regulation (EU) No. 2016-679 of April 27, 2016) can limit, under certain
circumstances, the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial
or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context.

Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply a foreign law
designated by the applicable rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) to the
extent provided by and in the circumstances set out in Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 on the law applicable to
contractual obligations (the Rome I Regulation) or (if applicable) Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 on the law applicable
to non-contractual obligations (the Rome II Regulation); for example, if overriding mandatory provisions of French
law (lois de police) are applicable or if overriding mandatory provisions of the law of the country where the obligations
have to be performed render such performance unlawful, or if the application of the foreign law in the case at hand is
deemed to contravene French international public policy (as determined on a case-by-case basis by French courts).
Furthermore, in an original action brought in France predicated solely upon the U.S. federal or state securities laws,
French courts may not have the requisite jurisdiction to adjudicate such action, notably French courts may not have
the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought.

Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can
sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the
foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French persons. Pursuant to Article 15
of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with
the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with a foreign claimant. For a
long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant,
could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to
more recent case law, a French national may be sued before a foreign court having jurisdiction if that court has
sufficient connection with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, French nationals
may waive their rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including without
limitation, by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court.

In this regard, it must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of December 12, 2012 (the
_Brussels I Recast Regulation) and the Lugano Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of_
judgments in civil and commercial matters of October 30, 2007 (the Lugano Convention), and for legal actions falling
within the scope of said Regulation or Convention, the privileges granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14
and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person domiciled in an EU Member State or in a State
bound by the Lugano Convention. Conversely, the privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be
invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a
defendant domiciled outside the EU in a State not bound by the Lugano Convention.

There still is doubt under French law as to the validity of one-sided jurisdiction clauses, _i.e., contractual_
provisions submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party an additional option
to choose another jurisdiction. The civil chamber of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation), further to several
decisions, considers that such clauses do not comply with the objective of foreseeability set out in applicable
international instruments unless the competent courts can be identified by reference to objective elements or
jurisdiction rules. Accordingly, any one-sided jurisdiction clauses which do not set out an objective basis (as a
reference to a ground of jurisdiction or to legal rules) in any relevant documents would not be binding on the party
submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French
courts. These decisions were issued on the basis of the Brussels I Recast Regulation or on the basis of the Lugano
Convention and have yet to be confirmed in cases that fall outside this scope.


-----

On the other hand, the Commercial Chamber of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has held that
a unilateral jurisdiction clause was valid in a decision issued on May 11, 2017. Accordingly, case law regarding the
validity of unilateral jurisdiction clauses under French law can be regarded as uncertain. Any provisions to the same
effect in any relevant documents may not be binding over the courts chosen by the parties.

The notes will be the issuer’s senior unsecured debt and will rank equal in right of payment to all of the
issuer’s existing and future senior debt. The notes will be guaranteed on an unsecured basis by (i) Crown and, subject
to applicable law and exceptions described herein, each of Crown’s subsidiaries in the United States, Canada,
Germany, France, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom that is an obligor
under Crown’s senior secured credit facilities or that guarantees or otherwise becomes liable with respect to any other
indebtedness of Crown, the issuer or another guarantor and (ii) subject to applicable law and exceptions described
herein, each of the issuer’s subsidiaries that guarantees or otherwise becomes liable with respect to any indebtedness
of Crown, the issuer or another guarantor or is otherwise an obligor under Crown’s senior secured credit facilities
which as of the issue date of the notes is expected to include certain subsidiaries organized under the laws of Canada,
Germany, France, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The laws of the
jurisdiction of organization of each such guarantor, and the laws of any jurisdiction in which assets are located, may
also limit or prevent investors from effecting service of process, enforcing the obligations of such guarantors, or
pursuing other remedies against such guarantors.

31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PricewaterhouseCoopers”), our
independent registered public accounting firm. The report of PricewaterhouseCoopers is incorporated by reference
into this offering memorandum.

**Currency and Other Information**

In this offering memorandum, references to “$”, “U.S. dollars”, “USD” and “dollars” are to United States
dollars, and references to “€” or “euro” are to euros.

This offering memorandum contains translations of certain euro amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates
solely for the convenience of the reader. These translations should not be construed as representations that the euro

rounded figures but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, certain percentage amounts in this
offering memorandum may vary from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in our
consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables may not be an arithmetic
aggregation of the figures which precede them.

**_Other Information. We own or have rights to use the trademarks, service marks and trade names that we use_**
in conjunction with the operation of our business. Solely for convenience, we may refer to our trademarks, service
marks and trade names in this offering memorandum without the TM and ® symbols, but such references are not
intended to indicate in any way that we will not assert, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, our rights
to our trademarks, service marks and trade names. In this offering memorandum, unless otherwise specified or the
context otherwise requires, a reference to a law or a provision of a law is a reference to that law or provision as
extended, amended or re-enacted.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE ISSUER**

Crown European Holdings is a société anonyme which was organized under the laws of France on September
19, 1996 and its corporate term shall continue until at least August 30, 2111. Its LEI is 85OKW2SW05RZFQS1W718.
Crown European Holdings is one of the consolidated subsidiaries of Crown Holdings, Inc., and except as otherwise
set forth herein, financial information about it is presented on a consolidated basis. The issuer believes that the nondisclosure of financial information regarding its accounts on an unconsolidated basis would not be likely to mislead
investors with regard to facts and circumstances that are essential for assessing the notes.


-----

**SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

This offering memorandum makes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, namely EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA of Crown. These non-GAAP measures are not recognized measures under U.S. GAAP, do not
have a standard meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures
presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement U.S.
GAAP measures by providing further understanding of Crown’s results of operations from management’s perspective.
Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial information
reported under U.S. GAAP.

Crown calculates EBITDA as net income plus the sum of income taxes, interest expense (net of interest
income) and depreciation and amortization. Crown calculates Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus the sum of
restructuring and other, including asset impairments and provision for asbestos, loss from early extinguishments of
debt, other pension and postretirement, foreign exchange, equity earnings and discontinued operations. For a
reconciliation of EBITDA to net income, and of Adjusted EBITDA to EBITDA, see “Summary—Summary Historical
Financial Data.”

We have included EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to provide investors with a supplemental measure of our
performance. We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are important supplemental measures of performance
because they eliminate items that may have less bearing on our performance and thus highlight trends in our core
business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP financial measures. We also believe
that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use EBITDA in the evaluation of issuer, many
of which present EBITDA when reporting their results.

Our management also uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in order to facilitate performance comparisons
from period to period, prepare annual operating budgets and assess our ability to meet our future debt service, capital
expenditure and working capital requirements.

A limitation associated with EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is that they do not reflect the periodic costs of
certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the business. Any measure that
eliminates components of the capital structure and costs associated with carrying significant amounts of assets on its
balance sheet has material limitations as a performance measure. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible
and intangible assets through other financial measures such as capital expenditures. In addition, in evaluating EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that the adjustments may vary from period to period and in the future
Crown will incur expenses such as those used in calculating these measures. Furthermore, EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA, as calculated by Crown within this document, may not be comparable to calculations of similarly titled
measures by other companies. In light of the foregoing limitations, Crown does not rely solely on EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA as performance measures and also considers its results as calculated in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. For purposes of the covenants in the indenture governing the notes, EBITDA is defined differently, and for
purposes of our credit facility and for reviewing goodwill for impairment, Adjusted EBITDA is defined differently.

This offering memorandum also makes reference to, or incorporates information regarding, segment income
and free cash flow, which are not defined terms under U.S. GAAP. In addition, the information presented in this
offering memorandum excluding the impact of currency translation, and regarding net income before certain items
does not conform to U.S. GAAP and includes non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures should not be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP
and may not be comparable to calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies. Although certain of this
data has been extracted or derived from the consolidated financial statements contained in this offering memorandum,
this data has not been audited or reviewed by the independent registered public accounting firm.

We view segment income as the principal measure of performance of our operations and free cash flow as
the principal measure of our liquidity. We consider both of these measures in the allocation of resources. Free cash
flow has certain limitations, however, including that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for
discretionary expenditures since other non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt service requirements,
are not deducted from the measure. The amount of non-discretionary versus discretionary expenditures can vary


-----

significantly between periods. We believe that net income before certain items is useful in evaluating Crown’s
operations as this measure is adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods.


-----

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

Statements included in this offering memorandum that are not historical facts (including any statements
concerning the direct or indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, conflicts in the Middle East and the RussiaUkraine war, objectives of management for share repurchases, dividends, future operations or economic performance,
or assumptions related thereto, including the potential for higher interest rates and energy prices) are “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements can be identified by
words, such as “believes,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “expects” and other words of similar meaning in connection
with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. These may include, among others, statements relating
to:

  - this offering and the use of proceeds therefrom described in this offering memorandum, and Crown’s ability
to implement it on the terms described herein;

  - Crown’s plans or objectives for future operations, products or financial performance;

  - Crown’s indebtedness and other contractual obligations;

  - the impact of an economic downturn or growth in particular regions;

  - Crown’s policies with respect to executive compensation;

  - Crown’s progress on sustainability and environmental matters; and

  - the expected outcome of contingencies, including with respect to asbestos-related litigation and Crown’s
pension and postretirement liabilities.

These forward-looking statements are made based upon Crown’s expectations and beliefs concerning future
events impacting Crown and, therefore, involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Crown cautions that forwardlooking statements are not guarantees and that actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied
in the forward-looking statements.

Important factors that could cause the actual results of operations or financial condition of Crown to differ
include, but are not necessarily limited to:

  - the ability of Crown to expand successfully in international and emerging markets;

  - the ability of Crown to repay, refinance or restructure its short and long-term indebtedness on adequate terms
and to comply with the terms of its agreements relating to debt;

  - the impact of Brexit;

  - Crown’s ability to generate significant cash to meet its obligations and invest in its business and to maintain
appropriate debt levels;

  - restrictions on Crown’s use of available cash under its debt agreements;

  - changes or differences in U.S. or international economic or political conditions, such as inflation or
fluctuations in interest or foreign exchange rates (and the effectiveness of any currency or interest rate
hedges), tax rates, and tax laws (including with respect to taxation of unrepatriated non-U.S. earnings or as a
result of the depletion of net loss or foreign tax credit carryforwards);

  - the impact of foreign trade laws and practices;

  - the collectability of receivables;

  - war, including the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, or acts of terrorism
that may disrupt Crown’s production or the supply or pricing of raw materials, impact the financial condition
of customers or adversely affect Crown’s ability to refinance or restructure its remaining indebtedness;


-----

- changes in the availability and pricing of raw materials (including aluminum can sheet, steel tinplate, energy,
water, inks and coatings) and Crown’s ability to pass raw material, energy and freight price increases and
surcharges through to its customers or to otherwise manage these commodity pricing risks;

- Crown’s ability to obtain and maintain adequate pricing for its products, including the impact on Crown’s
revenue, margins and market share and the ongoing impact of price increases;

- energy and natural resource costs;

- the cost and other effects of legal and administrative cases and proceedings, settlements and investigations;

- the outcome of asbestos-related litigation (including the number and size of future claims and the terms of
settlements, and the impact of bankruptcy filings by other companies with asbestos-related liabilities, any of
which could increase the asbestos-related costs to Crown Cork & Seal Company, Inc., a subsidiary of Crown
(“Crown Cork”), over time, the adequacy of reserves established for asbestos-related liabilities, Crown
Cork’s ability to obtain resolution without payment of asbestos-related claims by persons alleging first
exposure to asbestos after 1964, and the impact of state legislation dealing with asbestos liabilities and any
litigation challenging that legislation and any future state or federal legislation dealing with asbestos
liabilities);

- Crown’s ability to realize deferred tax benefits;

- changes in Crown’s critical or other accounting policies or the assumptions underlying those policies;

- labor relations and workforce and social costs, including Crown’s pension and postretirement obligations and
other employee or retiree costs;

- investment performance of Crown’s pension plans;

- the costs and difficulties related to the acquisition of a business and integration of acquired businesses;

- the impact of any actual or potential dispositions, acquisitions or other strategic realignments (such as
Crown’s divestiture of its European Tinplate business), which may impact Crown’s operations, financial
profile, investments or levels of indebtedness;

- Crown’s ability to realize efficient capacity utilization and inventory levels and to innovate new designs and
technologies for its products in a cost-effective manner;

  - **_Global leadership positions. Crown is a leading producer of beverage cans in North America, Europe and_**
Asia, and is a leading producer of food and aerosol cans and closures in North America. Crown maintains its
leadership through an extensive geographic presence, with 195 plants located throughout the world as of
December 31, 2023. Its large manufacturing base allows Crown to service its customers locally while
achieving significant economies of scale.


-----

  - **_Strong customer base. Crown provides packaging to many of the world’s leading consumer products_**
companies. Major customers include Anheuser-Busch InBev, Coca-Cola, Heineken, Keurig Dr Pepper,
Molson Coors, Pepsi-Cola and Refresco, among others. These consumer products companies represent
generally stable businesses that provide consumer staples such as soft drinks and alcoholic beverages. In
addition, Crown has long-standing relationships with many of its largest customers.

  - **_Broad and diversified product base. Crown continues to drive brand differentiation in the beverage can_**
market by increasing its ability to offer multiple specialty can sizes. Size variations include slim and sleek
cans, as well as larger sizes to help customers differentiate their products.

  - **_Business and industry fundamentals. Fundamental changes in its business, including global beverage can_**
demand, price increases, cost reduction initiatives and working capital reductions, have improved Crown’s
business outlook.

  - **_Technological leadership resulting in superior new product and process development. Crown believes that_**
it possesses the technology, processes and research, development and engineering capabilities to allow it to
provide innovative and value-added packaging solutions to its customers, as well as to design cost-efficient
manufacturing systems and materials.

  - **_Financially disciplined management team. Crown’s current executive leadership is focused on improving_**
profit and increasing free cash flow. Crown is prudent about its capital spending, attempting to pursue
projects that provide an adequate return.

**Business Strategy**

Crown has several key business strategies:

  - **_Grow in targeted markets. Crown plans to capitalize on its leading positions by targeting geographic areas_**
with strong growth potential. Crown believes that it is well-positioned to take advantage of the growth
potential in North America, Mexico, Brazil and Southeast Asia with recent capacity additions concentrated
in these markets. Crown also benefits from anticipated growth in the consumption of consumer goods in
Western Europe.

  - **_Increase margins through ongoing cost reductions. Crown plans to continue to reduce manufacturing costs,_**
enhance efficiencies and drive return on invested capital through investments in equipment and technology
and through improvements in productivity and material usage and by maintaining a disciplined approach to
managing supplier contracts.

  - **_Maximize cash flow generation. Crown has established performance-based incentives to increase its free_**
cash flow and operating income. In recent years, Crown has used proceeds from the sale of the European
Tinplate business, along with cash provided by operating activities, to support Crown’s capital allocation
strategy to reduce leverage, support beverage can expansion in North America, Western Europe and emerging
markets, and return capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchase of Crown’s shares.

    - Crown uses the economic profit concept in connection with its executive compensation program, which
requires each business unit to exceed prior year’s returns on the capital that it employs.

    - Crown will continue to focus its capital expenditures on projects that provide an adequate return.

   - **_Serve the changing needs of the world’s leading consumer products companies through technological_**
**_innovation. Crown intends to capitalize on the demand of its customers for higher value-added packaging_**
products. By continuing to improve the physical attributes of its products, such as strength of materials and
graphics, Crown plans to further improve its existing customer relationships, as well as attract new customers.

Use of Proceeds The net proceeds from this offering, together with cash on hand, will be
used to pay at maturity Crown European Holdings’ outstanding 2.625%
Senior Notes due in September 2024 (the “2024 Notes”), and to pay
related fees and expenses. See “Use of Proceeds.”

Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates may hold a portion of
the 2024 Notes, and as such, may receive a portion of the proceeds from
this offering. See “Plan of Distribution”.

the notes by an amount that equals or exceeds the statutory de minimis
amount, and accordingly, the notes may be issued with original issue

excess. In such event, investors in the notes that are subject to U.S.
federal income taxation will generally be required to include such OID
in their gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as it accrues on a constant yield-to-maturity basis, regardless of
their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes


-----

and generally in advance of the receipt of cash payments attributable to
such OID. See “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”

Risk Factors An investment in the notes involves risks. You should carefully consider
all of the information in this offering memorandum. In particular, you
should evaluate the specific risk factors set forth under the caption “Risk

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for illustrative and informational purposes only and do not purport
to represent, and should not be viewed as indicative of, Crown’s actual or future financial condition or results of
operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to net
income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of operating
performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
information is unaudited and has been included in this offering memorandum because Crown believes that certain
analysts, rating agencies and investors may use it as supplemental information to evaluate a company’s ability to
service its indebtedness and overall performance over time. However, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have


-----

material limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of
Crown’s results as reported under U.S. GAAP. A limitation associated with EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is
that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating
revenues in Crown’s business. Any measure that eliminates components of Crown’s capital structure and costs
associated with carrying significant amounts of assets on its balance sheet has material limitations as a
performance measure. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets through other
financial measures such as capital expenditures. In addition, in evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you
should be aware that the adjustments may vary from period to period and in the future Crown will incur expenses
such as those used in calculating these measures. Furthermore, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by
Crown, may not be comparable to calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies. In light of the
foregoing limitations, Crown does not rely solely on EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as performance measures
and also considers its results as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For purposes of the covenants in the
indenture governing the notes, EBITDA is defined differently, and for purposes of our credit facility and
reviewing goodwill for impairment, Adjusted EBITDA is defined differently.

(3) Working capital consists of current assets less current liabilities.

**RISK FACTORS**

_This offering involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below as_
_well as other information and data included or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum before_
_making an investment decision, including the information contained in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual_
_Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks_
_not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. The_
_actual occurrence of any of these risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results_
_of operations, ability to meet our financial obligations and prospects, in which case you may lose part or all of_
_your investment._

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_The substantial indebtedness of Crown could prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under its indebtedness,_**
**_including the notes and the note guarantees._**

Crown has substantial outstanding indebtedness. As a result of Crown’s substantial indebtedness, a
significant portion of Crown’s cash flow will be required to pay interest and principal on its outstanding
indebtedness, and Crown may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or have future borrowings
available under its senior secured credit facilities, to enable it to repay its indebtedness, including the notes, or to
fund other liquidity needs. As of June 30, 2024, Crown and its subsidiaries had approximately $7.4 billion of
indebtedness, excluding unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, including approximately $2.1 billion of
secured indebtedness and $297 million of additional indebtedness of non-guarantor subsidiaries and the ability to
borrow $1.6 billion under Crown’s senior secured revolving credit facilities.

The substantial indebtedness of Crown could:

    - make it more difficult for Crown and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations with respect to the
notes, such as the issuer’s obligation to purchase notes tendered as a result of a change in control of
Crown;

    - increase Crown’s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including rising
interest rates;

    - restrict Crown from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities, including any
planned expansion in emerging markets;

    - limit Crown’s ability to make capital expenditures both domestically and internationally in order to
grow Crown’s business or maintain manufacturing plants in good working order and repair;

    - limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants under Crown’s debt agreements,
Crown’s ability to obtain additional financing, dispose of assets or pay cash dividends;

    - require Crown to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to service its
indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund future working capital, capital
expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

    - require Crown to sell assets used in its business;

    - limit Crown’s ability to refinance its existing indebtedness, particularly during periods of adverse
credit market conditions when refinancing indebtedness may not be available under interest rates and
other terms acceptable to Crown or at all;

    - increase Crown’s cost of borrowing;

    - limit Crown’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in
which it operates; and

    - place Crown at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt.

If its financial condition, operating results and liquidity deteriorate, Crown’s creditors may restrict its
ability to obtain future financing and its suppliers could require prepayment or cash on delivery rather than extend


-----

credit which could further diminish Crown’s ability to generate cash flows from operations sufficient to service its
debt obligations. In addition, Crown’s ability to make payments on and refinance its debt and to fund its operations
will depend on Crown’s ability to generate cash in the future.

**_Crown and Crown European Holdings are holding companies with no direct operations and the notes will_**
**_be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of Crown’s subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes._**

Crown and Crown European Holdings are holding companies with no direct operations and for both the
year ended December 31, 2023 and the six months ended June 30, 2024, the subsidiaries of Crown that do not
guarantee the notes represented in the aggregate approximately 38% of consolidated net sales and 49% and 51%,
respectively, of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. The principal assets of Crown and Crown European Holdings are
the equity interests and investments they hold in their subsidiaries. As a result, they depend on dividends and other
payments from their subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet their financial obligations, including the
payment of principal of and interest on their outstanding debt. Their subsidiaries are legally distinct from them and
have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to them for such payment except
as provided in the note guarantees or pursuant to intercompany notes.

Not all of Crown’s or Crown European Holdings’ subsidiaries will guarantee the notes. Specifically, none
of (1) Crown European Holdings’ subsidiaries incorporated in African or Asian nations, Belgium, Greece,
Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Russia, Slovakia and Turkey and (2) Crown’s other foreign subsidiaries (other than,
subject to applicable law and exceptions described herein, certain subsidiaries incorporated in Canada, France,
Germany, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Switzerland) which are not also
subsidiaries of Crown European Holdings are expected to guarantee the notes. A holder of notes will not have any
claim as a creditor against subsidiaries of Crown that are not guarantors of the notes, and the indebtedness and
other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those non-guarantor subsidiaries will
be effectively senior to your claims.

**_The notes do not impose any limitations on Crown’s ability to incur additional debt, guarantees or other_**
**_obligations or make restricted payments._**

The indenture that will govern the notes will not restrict the future incurrence of unsecured indebtedness,
guarantees or other obligations. Except for the limitations on granting liens on the capital stock and indebtedness
of its subsidiaries and on certain limited assets Crown and certain of its subsidiaries own (or on entering into sale
and leaseback transactions with respect to those assets), the indenture will not restrict Crown’s ability to incur
secured indebtedness, grant liens on its assets or engage in sale and leaseback transactions. See “Description of the
Notes—Limitation on Liens” and “Description of the Notes—Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions.”

**_Your right to receive payments on the notes is effectively subordinated to Crown’s existing secured_**
**_indebtedness, including Crown’s existing senior secured credit facilities, and possible future secured_**
**_borrowings._**

The notes and the note guarantees will be effectively subordinated to the prior payment in full of Crown’s,
Crown European Holdings’ and the guarantors’ current and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value
of the assets securing such indebtedness. As of June 30, 2024, Crown and its subsidiaries had approximately $7.4
billion of indebtedness, excluding unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, including approximately $1.2
billion of secured indebtedness and $297 million of additional indebtedness of non-guarantor subsidiaries and the
ability to borrow $1.6 billion under Crown’s senior secured revolving credit facilities. Such secured indebtedness
may increase if Crown incurs secured indebtedness, including under Crown’s senior secured revolving credit
facilities, to finance an acquisition, fund dividends or the repurchase of Crown common stock or otherwise. Because
of the liens on the assets securing the senior secured credit facilities, in the event of the bankruptcy, wind-up,
reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of the borrowers or any guarantor of such indebtedness, the assets of the
borrowers or guarantors would be available to pay obligations under the notes offered hereby and other unsecured
obligations only after payments had been made on the borrowers’ or the guarantors’ secured indebtedness.
Sufficient assets may not remain after these payments have been made to make any payments on the notes offered
hereby and Crown’s other unsecured obligations, including payments of interest when due. Holders of the notes
offered hereby will participate ratably with all holders of other unsecured obligations that are deemed to be of the
same class as the notes offered hereby, and potentially with all of Crown’s other general creditors, based upon the
respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor, in Crown’s remaining assets. As a result, holders of the notes
offered hereby may receive less ratably than holders of secured indebtedness. In addition, all payments on the notes


-----

and the note guarantees will be prohibited in the event of a payment default on Crown’s secured indebtedness
(including borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities) and, for limited periods, upon the occurrence of
other defaults under the existing senior secured credit facilities. See “Description of Certain Indebtedness.”

**_Crown may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness, including the notes_**
**_offered hereby, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness,_**
**_which may not be successful._**

Crown’s ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance its indebtedness, including the notes
offered hereby, and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts, will depend on
Crown’s ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to general economic, financial, competitive,
legislative, regulatory and other factors that may be beyond Crown’s control.

We cannot assure you, however, that Crown’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations
or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable Crown to pay its indebtedness,
including the notes offered hereby, or to fund its other liquidity needs. If Crown’s cash flows and capital resources
are insufficient to fund its debt service obligations, Crown may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures,
sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance its indebtedness, including the notes
offered hereby. We cannot assure you that Crown would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions
would be successful and permitted under the terms of Crown’s existing or future debt agreements or that Crown
could release from these actions sufficient proceeds to meet any debt service obligations then due.

**_Notwithstanding Crown’s current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, Crown may still be able to_**
**_incur substantial additional debt or make certain restricted payments, which could exacerbate the risks_**
**_described above._**

Crown may be able to incur additional debt in the future, including in connection with acquisitions or joint
ventures, and may seek to raise additional indebtedness, including through the issuance of senior unsecured notes
by the Issuer or other subsidiaries of Crown in the near- or long-term. Although Crown’s senior secured credit
facilities and indentures governing its outstanding notes contain restrictions on Crown’s ability to incur
indebtedness, those restrictions are subject to a number of exceptions, and, under certain circumstances,
indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Crown may also consider
investments in joint ventures or acquisitions or increased capital expenditures, which may increase Crown’s
indebtedness. Moreover, although Crown’s senior secured credit facilities and indentures governing certain of its
outstanding notes contain restrictions on Crown’s ability to make restricted payments, including the declaration
and payment of dividends and the repurchase of Crown’s common stock, Crown is able to make such restricted
payments under certain circumstances which may increase indebtedness. In December 2021, Crown’s Board of
Directors authorized the repurchase of an aggregate amount of $3 billion of Crown common stock through the end
of 2024 and Crown currently pays a quarterly cash dividend (25 cents per share) to its shareholders. Adding new
debt to current debt levels or making otherwise restricted payments could intensify the related risks that Crown and
its subsidiaries now face. See “Capitalization” and “Description of Certain Indebtedness.”

**_Restrictive covenants in the debt agreements governing Crown’s other current or future indebtedness could_**
**_restrict Crown’s operating flexibility._**

The indentures and the agreements governing Crown’s senior secured credit facilities and certain of its
outstanding notes contain affirmative and negative covenants that limit the ability of Crown and its subsidiaries to
take certain actions. These restrictions may limit Crown’s ability to operate its businesses and may prohibit or limit
its ability to enhance its operations or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.

Crown’s senior secured credit facilities require Crown to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy
other financial conditions. The agreements or indentures governing Crown’s senior secured credit facilities and
certain of its outstanding notes restrict, among other things, the ability of Crown and the ability of all or
substantially all of its subsidiaries to:

    - incur or guarantee additional debt;

    - pay dividends or make other distributions, repurchase capital stock, repurchase subordinated debt and
make certain investments or loans;


-----

    - create liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions;

    - create restrictions on the payment of dividends and other amounts to Crown from subsidiaries;

    - make loans, investments and capital expenditures;

    - change accounting treatment and reporting practices;

    - enter into agreements restricting the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends to, make or repay loans
to, transfer property to, or guarantee indebtedness of, Crown or any of its subsidiaries;

    - sell or acquire assets, enter into leaseback transactions and merge or consolidate with or into other
companies; and

    - engage in transactions with affiliates.

In addition, the indentures and the agreements governing Crown’s senior secured credit facilities and
certain of its outstanding notes limit, among other things, the ability of Crown to enter into certain transactions,
such as mergers, consolidations, joint ventures, asset sales, sale and leaseback transactions and the pledging of
assets.

Furthermore, if Crown or certain of its subsidiaries experience specific kinds of changes of control,
Crown’s senior secured credit facilities will be due and payable and Crown will be required to offer to repurchase
outstanding notes.

The breach of any of these covenants by Crown or the failure by Crown to meet any of these ratios or
conditions could result in a default under any or all of such indebtedness. If a default occurs under any such
indebtedness, all of the outstanding obligations thereunder could become immediately due and payable, which
could result in a default under Crown’s other outstanding debt and could lead to an acceleration of obligations
related to the notes and other outstanding debt. The ability of Crown to comply with these covenants or indentures
governing other indebtedness it may incur in the future and its outstanding notes can be affected by events beyond
its control and, therefore, it may be unable to meet these ratios and conditions.

**_Crown is subject to certain restrictions that may limit its ability to make payments on its debt, including on_**
**_the notes and the note guarantees, out of the cash reserves shown on Crown’s consolidated financial_**
**_statements._**

The ability of Crown’s subsidiaries and joint ventures to pay dividends, make distributions, provide loans
or make other payments to Crown may be restricted by applicable state and foreign laws, potentially adverse tax
consequences and their agreements, including agreements governing their debt.

In addition, the equity interests of Crown’s joint venture partners or other shareholders in Crown’s nonwholly owned subsidiaries in any dividend or other distribution made by these entities would need to be satisfied
on a proportionate basis with Crown. As a result, Crown may not be able to access the cash flow of these entities
to service its debt, including the notes, and Crown cannot assure you that the amount of cash and cash flow reflected
on Crown’s financial statements will be fully available to Crown.

**_The note guarantee of a subsidiary guarantor will be released if such subsidiary guarantor no longer_**
**_guarantees or is otherwise an obligor of indebtedness under any Crown credit facility._**

Any subsidiary guarantee of the notes may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the
notes or the trustee under the indenture if the subsidiary guarantor is no longer a guarantor or an obligor of any
Crown credit facility or other indebtedness as described under “Description of the Notes—Ranking and
Guarantees.” The lenders under Crown’s senior secured credit facilities will have the discretion to release the
subsidiary guarantees under the senior secured credit facilities in a variety of circumstances. You will not have a
claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a subsidiary guarantor of the notes, and the indebtedness
and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those subsidiaries will effectively
be senior to your claims.


-----

**_Insolvency and administrative laws could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the notes and the_**
**_note guarantees._**

Your rights under the notes and the note guarantees will be subject to the insolvency and administrative
laws of several jurisdictions and you may not be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple
bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. The notes will be issued by Crown European Holdings, which is organized
under the laws of France, and the notes will be guaranteed by (i) Crown and, subject to applicable law and
exceptions described herein, each of Crown’s subsidiaries in the United States, Canada, France, Germany,
Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom that is an obligor under Crown’s
senior secured credit facilities or that guarantees or otherwise becomes liable with respect to any other indebtedness
of Crown, the issuer or another guarantor and (ii) subject to applicable law and exceptions described herein, each
of the issuer’s subsidiaries that guarantees or otherwise becomes liable with respect to any indebtedness of Crown,
the issuer or another guarantor or is otherwise an obligor under Crown’s senior secured credit facilities, including
certain subsidiaries organized under the laws of France, Germany, Mexico and the Netherlands. In the event of a
bankruptcy or insolvency event, proceedings could be initiated in France, the United States, the United Kingdom
or in one or more other jurisdictions in which the guarantors are domiciled. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings
are likely to be complex and costly and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the
enforcement of your rights. In addition, in actions brought in countries outside of the United States, courts may
choose to apply their own law rather than the law of the State of New York, which governs the indenture, the notes
and the note guarantees. The application of foreign law may limit your ability to enforce your rights under the notes
and the note guarantees. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Bankruptcy and Fraudulent Transfer Limitations”
and “Description of the Notes—Enforceability of Judgments.”

Under French insolvency law, holders of debt securities may be grouped into one or multiple assemblies
of holders (into a class of Affected Parties as defined below) in order to defend their common interests if a safeguard
procedure or an accelerated safeguard procedure (procédure de sauvegarde or procédure de sauvegarde accélérée)
or a judicial reorganization procedure (procedure de redressement judiciaire) is commenced in France with respect
to the issuer and classes of Affected Parties’ are established. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Bankruptcy
and Fraudulent Transfer Limitations.”

Debt securities holders are, where applicable, distributed to one or more classes of Affected Parties by the
judicial administrator according to legal criteria. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Bankruptcy and
Fraudulent Transfer Limitations.”

Holders of all debt securities issued by the issuer (including the notes), whether or not under a debt
issuance program (such as a Euro Medium Term Note programme) and regardless of their governing law, may
attend and vote at their respective Assembly.

The holders of debt securities’ class deliberates on the proposed safeguard plan _(projet de plan de_
_sauvegarde), accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde accélérée), or judicial reorganization plan_
_(projet de plan de redressement) applicable to the issuer and may further agree to:_

    - decrease the rights of holders of debt securities (including the holders of the notes) by rescheduling
or reducing due payments and/or partially or totally writing off receivables in the form of debt
securities;

    - impose unequal treatment between holders of debt securities (including the holders of the notes), as
appropriate under the circumstances; and/or

    - decide to convert debt securities (including the notes) into securities that give or may give rights to
shares if the debtor is a joint stock company whose shareholders assume liability for the company’s
losses only to the extent of their contributions.

Decisions of a class of Affected Parties (as defined below) require approval by a two-thirds majority of
the class (calculated on the votes held by the members casting a vote at the Assembly or represented thereat). No
quorum is required to hold the class.


-----

For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions relating to the meetings of the holders of the notes described in
this offering memorandum will not be applicable to the extent they conflict with compulsory insolvency law
provisions that apply in these circumstances. For further discussion of certain insolvency proceedings governed by
French law, see “Description of the Notes—Certain Bankruptcy and Fraudulent Transfer Limitations.”

**_The notes and the note guarantees may be voidable, subordinated or limited in scope under insolvency,_**
**_fraudulent transfer, corporate or other laws._**

Fraudulent transfer and insolvency laws may void, subordinate or limit the notes and the note guarantees.

See “Description of the Notes—Certain Bankruptcy and Fraudulent Transfer Limitations.”

_United States_

Under U.S. federal bankruptcy laws or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, the
issuance of the note guarantees by Crown and the subsidiary guarantors could be voided, or claims in respect of
such obligations could be subordinated to all of their other debts and other liabilities, if, among other things, at the
time Crown and/or the subsidiary guarantors issued the related note guarantees, Crown or the applicable subsidiary
guarantor intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor, or received less than reasonably
equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of such indebtedness and either:

    - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

    - was engaged in a business or transaction for which Crown’s or such subsidiary guarantor’s remaining
assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or

    - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they
mature.

By its terms, the note guarantee of each guarantor will limit the liability of each such guarantor to the
maximum amount it can pay without the note guarantee being deemed a fraudulent transfer.

_United Kingdom_

Certain of the subsidiary guarantors are incorporated in, maintain their respective registered offices in and
conduct their business and the administration of their interests on a regular basis in and from England (each a “UK
Provider”). On the basis of these factors, an English court may conclude that the “centre of main interests” (as that
term is used in Article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation (as defined below)) of the UK Providers for all purposes
of the Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency
proceedings (recast), as it forms part of English law (including, where applicable, relevant separation agreement
law) by virtue of the EUWA and The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (the “Insolvency
Regulation”), is England and therefore insolvency proceedings in England constituting “main insolvency
proceedings” under article 3(1) of the Insolvency Regulation may be commenced in respect of a UK Provider.

Administration

Administration is an insolvency procedure under the U.K. Insolvency Act 1986, pursuant to which a
company may be reorganized or its assets realized under the protection of a statutory moratorium. A company may
be put into administration either pursuant to a court order or via an out-of-court process. Broadly speaking (and
subject to specific conditions), a company can be placed into administration at the application of, among others,
the company itself, its directors or one or more of its creditors (including contingent and prospective creditors). A
holder of a qualifying floating charge over the whole or substantially the whole of the assets of the company also
has the right to appoint an administrator. In addition, such holder has the right to intervene in an administration
application by nominating an alternative administrator or in certain very specific circumstances, by blocking the
appointment altogether by the appointment of an administrative receiver. Broadly speaking, an interim moratorium
comes into effect when an application for an administration order (in the case of court appointment) or a notice of
intention to appoint an administrator is made. At the commencement of the appointment of an administrator, a full
statutory moratorium applies, pursuant to which creditors cannot take action against the company, including, among
other things, commencing a legal process against the company, winding up the company or enforcing security or


-----

repossessing goods in the company’s possession under a hire purchase agreement without the consent of the
administrator or permission of the court. If a UK Provider were to enter administration, it is possible that the
guarantee granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration. Broadly speaking, expenses that qualify
as expenses of the administration (and which include, among others, expenses properly incurred by the
administrator in performing his functions and necessary disbursements incurred in the course of the administration)
enjoy priority status together with certain preferential debts (being certain amounts due to the UK Government)
and the prescribed part (being floating charge realisations not exceeding £800,000 for distribution to a company’s
unsecured creditors). Claims of creditors may be submitted to the administrator, although court approval generally
will be required before the administrator can make a distribution to unsecured creditors. Time limits may be set for
receipt and processing of claims before interim dividends are paid.

Limitation on enforcement

The grant of a guarantee by any of the UK Providers in respect of the obligations of another group
company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must not be restricted by
the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow such
an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights
unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with the company in good faith,
however the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be
established for the company in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the UK
Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most
likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a
transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as
directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court.

Challenges to guarantees

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by a company of guarantees
can be challenged. The following paragraphs discuss potential grounds for challenge that may apply to guarantees.

_Transaction at an undervalue._ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or an administrator of a
company could apply to the court for an order to set aside a guarantee granted by the company (or give other relief)
on the grounds that the creation of such guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. The grant of a
guarantee will only be a transaction at an undervalue if the transaction constitutes a gift or is made on terms that
provide that the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less
value, in money or in money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. For a challenge to be made,
the guarantee must be granted within a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in
section 240 of the UK Insolvency Act 1986, as amended). In addition, the company must have been “unable to pay
its debts” at the time that it granted the guarantee or became “unable to pay its debts” as a result. A company will
be “unable to pay its debts” if a statutory demand for over £750 is served on the company and remains unsatisfied
for three weeks or an execution on or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of a court in favor of a
creditor is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part or if it is proved to the court’s satisfaction that the company is
not able to pay its debts as they fall due or that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its
liabilities (taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities). A court will not make an order in respect of
a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for
the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing
the transaction would benefit the company. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a
transaction at an undervalue the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would
have been if the transaction had not been entered into (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees
or setting aside any guarantees although there is protection for a third party that benefits from the transaction and
has acted in good faith and for value). In any challenge proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to
demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a
“connected person” (as defined in the U.K. Insolvency Act 1986, as amended), in which case there is a presumption
that the company was unable to pay its debts and the connected person must demonstrate that the company was not
unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction. An administrator or liquidator is permitted to assign to a third
party any claim or potential claim in respect of a transaction at an undervalue.


-----

Preference

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a company could apply to the court for an
order to set aside a guarantee granted by such company (or give other relief) on the grounds such guarantee
constituted a preference. The grant of a guarantee is a preference if it has the effect of placing a creditor (or a surety
or guarantor of the company) in a better position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation than if the
guarantee had not been granted. For a challenge to be made, the decision to prefer must be made within the period
of six months ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the UK Insolvency Act 1986, as
amended) if the beneficiary of the guarantee is not a connected person or two years if the beneficiary is a connected
person. In addition, the company must have been “unable to pay its debts” at the time it gave the preference or
become “unable to pay its debts” as a result. A company’s “inability to pay its debts” in this scenario has the same
meaning as in the case of a transaction at an undervalue save that, in the case of a preference, there is no presumption
of insolvency if the parties are connected. A court may not make an order in respect of a preference of a person
unless it is satisfied that the company in deciding to give the preference was influenced by a desire to put that
person in a better position. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court can make such
order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (which
could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside the guarantees). There is protection for a
third party that benefits from the transaction and acted in good faith and for value. In any proceedings, it is for the
administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was unable to pay its debts and that the company was
influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected
person, in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential
effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence. An
administrator or liquidator is permitted to assign to a third party any claim or potential claim in respect of a
preference.

Transaction defrauding creditors

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or an administrator of a company, a person who is a victim of
the relevant transaction and, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the UK
Pensions Regulator can apply to the court for an order to set aside a guarantee granted by that company on the
grounds the guarantee was a transaction defrauding creditors.

A transaction will constitute a transaction defrauding creditors if it is a transaction at an undervalue (as
outlined above) and the court is satisfied the substantial purpose of a party to the transaction was to put assets
beyond the reach of actual or potential claimants against it or to prejudice the interest of such persons.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, then it may make such
order as it may deem fit to restore the position to what it was prior to the transaction or protect the victims of the
transaction (including reducing payments under the guarantee or setting aside the guarantees) but there is protection
for a third party acting in good faith and for value without notice of the relevant circumstances. Any “victim” of
the transaction (with the leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) may apply to court
under this provision and not just liquidators or administrators. There is no time limit in the English insolvency
legislation within which the company must enter insolvency proceedings and the relevant company does not need
to have been unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction.

Extortionate Credit Transaction

Further, an administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction.
The court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by a company up to three years before the day on
which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having
regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly
exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision
of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. An administrator or liquidator
is permitted to assign to a third party any claim or potential claim in respect of an extortionate credit transaction.


-----

Currency of Debt

In addition, under English insolvency law any debt payable in a currency other than pounds sterling must
be converted into pounds sterling at the rate determined by the office holder by reference to prevailing exchange
rates. The office holder is required to advise the creditors of the rate determined and there is the ability for a creditor
to apply to the courts if the determination is unreasonable. This provision overrides any agreement between the
parties. Accordingly, in the event that a UK Provider goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the notes
may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date that such UK Provider went into liquidation or administration
and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the notes may become entitled.

_France_

A French court may, under certain circumstances, set aside a guarantee granted by a French company for
the benefit of an affiliated company, even when the companies are part of a structured group with common
economic, social and financial interests and the guarantee complies with policies adopted for the group as a whole,
if the guarantor does not derive benefit from the arrangements made, its obligations are disproportionate in light of
the benefits derived, or the liability assumed by the guarantor exceeds the guarantor’s financial resources. A French
court may also refuse to enforce a guarantee if it is determined that the company granting such guarantee was
insolvent at the time the guarantee was granted. In addition, a French court may grant a debtor or guarantor a period
of time to perform its obligation.

Under French financial assistance rules (within the meaning of Article L.225-216 of the French
Commercial Code) a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used,
directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition and/or to subscribe to its shares. See “Limitation on
guarantees”.

French law requires that when a company grants a guarantee of third party obligations, the guarantee must
be in the corporate purpose and corporate interest of the guarantor, otherwise it could cause the directors of such
guarantor to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. In addition, if a French guarantor
receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, economic benefits that are less than the economic benefits such French
guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arms’ length basis, the difference between the actual
economic benefit and that in a comparable arms’ length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.

Under French corporate benefit rules, a court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment
had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant
guarantor, if the court found that the French guarantor did not receive some real and adequate corporate benefit
from the transaction involving the grant of the guarantee as a whole. Existence of corporate benefit is a factual
matter which must be determined on a case-by-case basis. French case law has recognized that certain intra-group
transactions (including upstream guarantees), can be in the corporate interest of the guarantor, in particular where
the four following criteria are fulfilled:

    - the existence of a genuine group of companies operating under a common strategy working towards
a common objective and the guarantee and the transaction to which it relates must be entered into in
the common economic intent of the group as a whole and the liability under the guarantee should be
commensurate of such group benefit;

    - the risk assumed by a French guarantor must be proportionate to the benefit;

    - the French guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit, consideration or advantage from
the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee which is commensurate to such group
benefit; and

    - the obligations of the French guarantor under the guarantee must not exceed its financial capability.

The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are
commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.


-----

Accordingly, the enforcement of the note guarantees given by (1) Crown Bevcan France SAS, (2) Crown
Developpement, (3) Crown Europe SAS, (4) Société Civile Immobilière des Baquets, (5) Société Civile
Immobilière Rousseau Ivry, (6) SPG France Holdings, and (7) Signode France SAS and any other French guarantor
that would execute and deliver a note guarantee (each, a “French Subsidiary Guarantor”) will be limited as to each
French Subsidiary Guarantor or its subsidiaries, to the extent required by French law, to an amount that represents
either (i) the amount of such proceeds made available to such French Subsidiary Guarantor via intergroup loans or
otherwise or (ii) the equivalent in euros of the portion of the proceeds of the notes used directly or indirectly to
repay or refinance obligations of, or obligations guaranteed (to the extent permitted under French law) by, such
French Subsidiary Guarantor or its subsidiaries, or to fund or refinance (directly or indirectly) advances or loans to
such French Subsidiary Guarantor from time to time. The enforcement of the note guarantees given by each French
Subsidiary Guarantor or its subsidiaries will further be limited to the extent required by applicable law to the
maximum amount such French Subsidiary Guarantor can pay without exceeding its financial capacity or otherwise
resulting in insolvency of the guarantor as of the date the note guarantee is subscribed or, if later further amended,
restated or reaffirmed, as of such later date. Any payment that would be made by such guarantor under its guarantee
would reduce the maximum amount of its guarantee.

In the light of the foregoing, each French Subsidiary Guarantor’s obligations under the note guarantees
could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes or a French Subsidiary Guarantor may
have effectively no obligation under the note guarantee.

It is also possible that a French guarantor, or a creditor of a French guarantor, or the bankruptcy trustee in
the case of a bankruptcy of a French guarantor’s guarantee on any of the above grounds and that the applicable
court may determine that such guarantee should be limited or voided. See “Description of the Notes—Certain
Bankruptcy and Fraudulent Transfer Limitations.”

_Germany_

Under German insolvency law, the insolvency administrator (and, in some cases, on a derivative basis,
the company’s creditors) may under certain circumstances rescind certain pre-insolvency transactions entered into
by such company. Details are set forth in sections 129 to 147 German Insolvency Act. The insolvency administrator
may in particular seek the rescission of any legal act that directly discriminates against the creditors of such
company or is detrimental to the insolvency estate if such legal act was entered into within three months prior to
the application to open the insolvency proceedings and certain other criteria are met (Section 132 German
Insolvency Act). This may affect the enforcement of the guarantees to be given by Crown’s subsidiaries organized
under the laws of Germany.

_Other_

The laws of each of the jurisdictions in which the non-U.S. subsidiary guarantors are organized limit the
ability of these subsidiaries to guarantee debt of third parties, including their parent company or affiliates. These
limitations arise under various provisions or principles of corporate law which include provisions requiring the
entry into the guarantee to be in the corporate interest of the subsidiary guarantor or a subsidiary guarantor to
receive adequate corporate benefit from the financing, rules governing preservation of share capital, thin
capitalization, financial assistance and fraudulent transfer principles. In many of these jurisdictions, including
Canada, Luxembourg, Mexico and Switzerland, the note guarantees will contain language limiting the amount of
debt guaranteed or otherwise qualifying the guarantee in order to address applicable local law considerations.
Accordingly, if you were to enforce the note guarantees in these jurisdictions, your claims may be limited.
Furthermore, although Crown believes that the note guarantees are generally enforceable (subject to local law
restrictions), a third party creditor may challenge these note guarantees and prevail in court. Likewise, the guarantee
may, under certain circumstances, be nullified or rescinded by the insolvency court at the request of its trustee in
bankruptcy or insolvency administrator, as applicable, or any of the subsidiary guarantor’s creditors.


-----

**_Crown’s senior secured credit facilities, the notes and other indebtedness provide that certain change of_**
**_control events constitute an event of default. In the event of a change of control, Crown, Crown European_**
**_Holdings and the guarantors may not be able to satisfy all of their obligations under the senior secured_**
**_credit facilities, the notes or other indebtedness._**

Crown, Crown European Holdings’ and the guarantors may not have sufficient assets or be able to obtain
sufficient third-party financing on favorable terms to satisfy all of their obligations under Crown’s senior secured
credit facilities, the notes or other indebtedness in the event of a change of control. If Crown or Crown European
Holdings’ experiences a change of control repurchase event, the issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all
outstanding notes. However, Crown’s senior secured credit facilities provide that certain change of control events
constitute an event of default under the senior secured credit facilities. Such an event of default entitles the lenders
thereunder to, among other things, cause all outstanding debt obligations under the senior secured credit facilities
to become due and payable and to proceed against the collateral securing the senior secured credit facilities. Any
event of default or acceleration of the senior secured credit facilities will likely also cause a default under the terms
of other indebtedness of Crown.

In addition, Crown’s senior secured credit facilities contain, and any future credit facilities or other
agreements to which Crown becomes a party may contain, restrictions on its ability to offer to repurchase the notes
in connection with a change of control. In the event a change of control repurchase event occurs at a time when it
is prohibited from offering to purchase the notes, the issuer could seek consent to offer to purchase the notes or
attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such a prohibition. If it does not obtain the consent or refinance
the borrowings, the issuer would remain prohibited from offering to purchase the notes. In such case, the failure by
the issuer to offer to purchase the notes would constitute a default under the indenture governing the notes, which,
in turn, could result in amounts outstanding under any future credit facility or other agreement relating to
indebtedness being declared due and payable. Any such declaration could have adverse consequences to Crown,
the issuer and the holders of the notes.

**_You may not be able to determine when a change of control repurchase event has occurred and may not be_**
**_able to require the issuer to purchase the notes as a result of a change in the composition of the directors_**
**_on Crown’s board of directors._**

Legal uncertainty regarding what constitutes a change of control repurchase event and the provisions of
the indenture may allow Crown to enter into transactions, such as acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations,
that would not constitute a change of control repurchase event but may increase Crown’s outstanding indebtedness
or otherwise affect Crown’s ability to satisfy its obligations under the notes. The definition of change of control
includes a phrase relating to the transfer of “all or substantially all” of the assets of Crown and its subsidiaries taken
as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no
precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, your ability to require the issuer to
repurchase notes as a result of a transfer of less than all of the assets of Crown to another person may be uncertain.

In addition, in a 2009 decision, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware raised the possibility that
a change of control put right occurring as a result of a failure to have “continuing directors” comprising a majority
of a board of directors might be unenforceable on public policy grounds.

**_If an active trading market for the notes does not develop, the liquidity and value of the notes could be_**
**_harmed._**

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act. Accordingly, the notes may only be offered
or sold pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or pursuant to an effective
registration statement. We do not have an obligation, nor do we currently intend, to register the resale of the notes
under the Securities Act or to offer to exchange the notes in an exchange offer registered under the Securities Act.
There is no existing market for the notes. Crown European Holdings intends to submit an application to list the
notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and trade the notes on the Euro MTF. Even if Crown
European Holdings submits such an application, it cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for
the notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your notes at their fair market value
or at all. Future trading prices of the notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, Crown
European Holdings’ prevailing interest rates, demand for high yield debt securities generally, general economic
conditions, Crown European Holdings’ and Crown’s financial performance or prospects or the prospects of the
companies in their industry and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a trading market for the notes


-----

may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for noninvestment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of
securities similar to the notes. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the notes,
regardless of our prospects and financial performance. The initial purchasers have advised Crown European
Holdings that they currently intend to make a market in the notes after this offering is completed. However, the
initial purchasers may cease their market-making activities at any time. Crown European Holdings does not intend
to apply for listing of the notes on any securities exchange, except for the application to list the notes on the Official
List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to trade the notes on the Euro MTF. There can be no assurance that
the notes will be accepted for listing on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and trading on the
Euro MTF. See “Listing.”

**_Any decline in the ratings of our corporate credit could adversely affect the value of the notes._**

Any decline in the ratings of our corporate credit or any indications from the rating agencies that their
ratings on our corporate credit are under surveillance or review with possible negative implications could adversely
affect the value of the notes. In addition, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect our ability to access capital.

**_The notes will initially be held in book-entry form and, therefore, you must rely on the procedures and the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise your rights and remedies._**

Unless and until certificated notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests in the notes, owners of
the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of notes. Instead, the common depositary for
Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole holder of the notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts
owing on or in respect of the notes in global form will be made to the paying agent. Such paying agent will, in turn,
make such payments to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments
to participants in accordance with the common depositary’s procedures. Unlike holders of the notes themselves,
owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents or requests
for waivers or other actions from holders of the notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be
permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and/or Clearstream
or, if applicable, a participant. We cannot assure you that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies
will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested actions on a timely basis. The lack of physical certificates
could also:

    - result in payment delays on your notes because the trustee will be sending payments on the notes to
Euroclear and Clearstream instead of directly to you;

    - make it difficult for you to pledge your notes if physical certificates are required by the party
demanding the pledge; and

    - hinder your ability to resell your notes because some investors may be unwilling to buy notes that are
not in physical form.

**_An investor may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations._**

The issuer and certain of the guarantors are organized and established under the laws of France. Certain
directors and executive officers of the issuer are non-residents of the United States and a substantial portion of their
assets are located outside of the United States. As a result, although the issuer and the French guarantors have
appointed an agent for service of process under the indenture governing the notes, you may not be able to effect
service of process within the United States upon those persons or to enforce, in courts outside of the United States,
judgments against those persons obtained in U.S. courts, whether or not based upon the civil liability provisions of
the federal securities laws of the United States. Moreover, actions of the issuer may not be subject to the civil
liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of
Liabilities.”

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of judgments rendered in civil and commercial matters with France, unlike for arbitral awards. The enforceability
in France of civil liabilities based upon U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in France is
neither automatic nor certain. In addition, the enforcement in France of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based
on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain


-----

conditions. It is also uncertain whether a French court would have the requisite power or authority to grant certain
remedies sought in an original action brought in France on the basis of U.S. securities laws violations. For further
information see “Service of Process and Enforcement of Liabilities.”

**_You may face foreign exchange risks or adverse tax consequences by investing in the notes._**

The notes will be denominated and payable in euros. If you measure your investment returns by reference
to a currency other than the euro, an investment in the notes will entail foreign exchange related risks due to, among
other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which
you measure the return on your investments because of economic, political and other factors over which Crown
European Holdings has no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which you measure
the return on your investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the notes below their stated coupon
rates and could result in a loss to you when the return on the notes is translated into the currency by reference to
which you measure the return on your investments. Investment in the notes may also have important tax
consequences as a result of any foreign currency exchange gains or losses. See “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations” and “Material French Tax Considerations.”

**_Holders of the notes will receive payments solely in euro._**

All payments of interest on and the principal of the notes and any redemption price for the notes will be
made in euros. We, the initial purchasers, the trustee and the paying agent with respect to the notes will not be
obligated to convert, or to assist any registered owner or beneficial owner of the notes in converting, payments of
interest, principal, any redemption price or any additional amount in euro made with respect to the notes into U.S.
dollars or any other currency.

**_Trading in the clearing systems is subject to minimum denomination requirements._**

The notes will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof. It is possible that the clearing systems may process trades which could result in amounts being held
in denominations smaller than the minimum denominations. If definitive notes are required to be issued in relation
to the notes in accordance with the provisions of the relevant global notes, a holder who does not have the minimum
denomination or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof in its account with the relevant clearing system at
the relevant time may not receive all of its entitlement in the form of definitive notes unless and until such time as
its holding satisfies the minimum denomination requirement.

**_Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) withholding may apply to payments to certain_**
**_foreign entities._**

Under “FATCA,” a U.S. withholding tax of 30% may be imposed on payments made under certain debt
instruments to foreign entities (including an entity acting as an intermediary) identified under the FATCA rules.
This tax may apply to certain payments of interest (including original issue discount, if any), unless the foreign
entity complies with certain information reporting, withholding, identification, certification and related
requirements imposed by FATCA.

FATCA generally applies to debt instruments issued by U.S. issuers and, in limited circumstances, to debt
instruments issued by certain non-U.S. issuers. Under current FATCA rules, payments of interest on debt
instruments of a non-U.S. issuer issued more than 6 months after the adoption of final FATCA regulations regarding
non-U.S. issuers may be subject to FATCA withholding. Final FATCA regulations addressing non-U.S. issuers
have not been issued as of the date hereof. If, however, the notes are considered as significantly modified under
U.S. tax law in the future, there can be no assurance that the notes will not be considered debt instruments subject
to FATCA. If FATCA withholding is imposed, additional amounts would not be payable in respect thereof and, as
a result, payments made to you hereunder would be reduced by the amount of such withholding. You should consult
your tax advisors regarding FATCA and how it may affect your investment in the notes. For more information, see
“Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”

**_The notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The stated principal amount of the notes may exceed the issue price of the notes by an amount that equals
or exceeds the statutory de minimis amount and, accordingly, the notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal
income tax purposes in an amount equal to such excess. In such event, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,


-----

investors in the notes that are subject to U.S. federal income taxation will be required to include such OID in gross
income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes as it accrues on a constant yield-to-maturity
basis, regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and generally in
advance of the receipt of cash payments attributable to such OID. See “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations.”

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

Crown estimates that the net proceeds from this offering, and after deducting estimated offering expenses,

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS**

**Credit Facilities**

Set forth below is a summary of the terms of Crown’s senior secured credit facilities. You should refer to
the appropriate sections of the respective agreements governing each of Crown’s senior secured credit facilities for
all of the terms thereof, which are available upon request from Crown.

**_Borrowers_**

The borrowers under Crown’s senior secured credit facilities are Crown Americas, Signode Industrial
Group US Inc., Crown European Holdings, CROWN Metal Packaging Canada LP and certain subsidiaries of
Crown European Holdings approved by the administrative agent.

**_The Facilities_**

Crown’s senior secured credit facilities include the following as of June 30, 2024:

(i) a $800 million Dollar Revolving Facility,

(ii) a $800 million Multicurrency Revolving Facility,

(iii) a $50 million Canadian Revolving Facility,

(iv) a $1,575 million Term Loan A Facility and

(v) a €520 million Term Euro Facility (together, the “Pro Rata Facilities”).

The maturity date for the Pro Rata Facilities is in August 2027. The applicable interest margins and
commitment fee in respect of the Pro Rata Facilities are subject to a grid.

**_Guarantees_**

Crown Holdings and each of its direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries (the “U.S. Credit Parties”) guarantee
borrowings by Crown Americas and Signode Industrial Group US Inc. under the Term Loan A Facility, the Dollar
Revolving Credit Facility and all other loans of Crown Americas. The U.S. Credit Parties, certain of Crown’s
subsidiaries in Canada, England, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and Crown European
Holdings’ subsidiaries organized in France, Germany, Mexico and the Netherlands guarantee borrowings under
the Credit Facilities by non-U.S. borrowers.

**_Security_**

Borrowings under the Credit Facilities are secured by a pledge of capital stock of Crown Holding’s direct
and indirect subsidiaries (existing or thereafter acquired or created); provided that the pledge of capital stock of
any first-tier non-U.S. subsidiaries is limited to 65% of such capital stock.

**_Prepayments; Covenants; Events of Default_**

The Credit Facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants, financial covenants requiring Crown
Holdings to maintain a maximum leverage ratio, representations and warranties and events of default customary
for facilities of this type. In addition, the term loan facility contains mandatory prepayment provisions customary
for facilities of this type. The Credit Facilities also permit the borrowers to incur additional secured and unsecured
debt (including additional first lien debt), subject to covenant compliance and other terms and conditions.

**Outstanding Senior Notes due 2025**

On May 5, 2015, Crown European Holdings issued senior notes under an indenture among Crown
European Holdings, the guarantors named therein, U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee,
Elavon Financial Services DAC (formerly Elavon Financial Services Limited, U.K. Branch), as paying agent, and
Elavon Financial Services DAC (formerly Elavon Financial Services Limited), as registrar and transfer agent


-----

Set forth below is a summary of the terms of the outstanding senior notes due 2025. You should refer to
the indenture for all of the terms thereof, which is filed with the SEC as Exhibit 10 to Crown’s Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q filed on July 30, 2015.

**_Principal, Maturity and Interest_**

The senior notes issued by Crown European Holdings will mature on May 15, 2025 and accrue interest at
the rate of 3.375% per year. The aggregate principal amount outstanding as of June 30, 2024 of the senior notes
due 2025 was €600 million. Interest on such series of senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on each May
15 and November 15.

**_Ranking and Guarantees_**

The senior notes due 2025 are senior obligations of Crown European Holdings, ranking senior in right of
payment to all subordinated indebtedness of Crown European Holdings.

The indenture under which the outstanding debentures were issued provides certain protections for the
holders of such debentures. These protections restrict the ability of Crown to enter into certain transactions, such
as mergers, consolidations, asset sales, sale and leaseback transactions and pledging of assets.

**_Consolidation, Merger, Conveyance, Transfer or Lease_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the indenture and agreements contain a restriction on the ability of Crown
to undergo a consolidation or merger, or to transfer or lease substantially all of its properties and assets.

**_Limitation on Sale and Leaseback_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the indenture and agreements contain a covenant prohibiting Crown and
certain “restricted subsidiaries” from selling any “principal property” to a person or entity and then subsequently
entering into an arrangement with such person or entity that provides for the leasing by Crown or any of its restricted
subsidiaries, as lessee, of such principal property. “Principal property” is defined in the indenture and agreements


-----

as any single manufacturing or processing plant or warehouse (excluding any equipment or personalty located
therein) located in the United States, other than any such plant or warehouse or portion thereof that Crown’s board
of directors reasonably determines is not of material importance to the business conducted by Crown and its
subsidiaries as an entirety. In the indenture and agreements, the definition of “principal property” includes property
located outside the United States. The indenture and agreements define “restricted subsidiary” to mean any
subsidiary that owns, operates or leases one or more principal properties.

**_Limitations on Liens_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the indenture and agreement contain a covenant restricting Crown and its
restricted subsidiaries under such indenture or agreement from creating or assuming any mortgage, security interest,
pledge or lien upon any principal property (as defined above) or any shares of capital stock or evidences of
indebtedness for borrowed money issued by any such restricted subsidiary and owned by Crown or any such
restricted subsidiary without concurrently providing that the outstanding debentures shall be secured equally and
ratably. The foregoing covenant shall not apply to the extent that the amount of indebtedness secured by liens on
Crown’s principal properties and Crown’s restricted subsidiaries does not exceed 10% of its consolidated net
tangible assets.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

**General**

Crown European Holdings S.A. (the “Issuer”) will issue €600 million aggregate principal amount of   %
senior notes due  , 2030 in the offering contemplated by this offering memorandum (the “Offering”) under an
indenture (the “Indenture”) to be dated as of  , 2024 among the Issuer, the Guarantors (as defined below) and
U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”).

For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” references to “the Issuer” are references to Crown
European Holdings S.A. and not any of its Subsidiaries. The definitions of certain other terms used in the following
summary are set forth below under “—Certain Definitions.”

The terms of the notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by
reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”). The notes are subject to all
such terms, and Holders of notes are referred to the Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act for a statement thereof.
The following summary of certain provisions of the Indenture is not necessarily complete and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the Indenture, including the definitions therein of certain terms used below. You should
read the Indenture because it, and not this summary, will define your rights as a Holder of notes. Copies of the form
of the Indenture are available from the initial purchasers.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

In this Offering, the Issuer will issue €600 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes. The Issuer
under the Indenture may issue additional notes in an unlimited amount (the “Additional Notes”) from time to time
under the Indenture. However, no offering of any Additional Notes is being or shall in any manner be deemed to
be made by this offering memorandum. The notes and any Additional Notes of the same series issued under the
same Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture.

The notes will mature on      , 2030. Interest on the notes will accrue at the rate of         % per
annum. Interest on the notes will be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on       and         , commencing
on     , 2025, to Holders of record of the notes on the immediately preceding          and         . Interest
on the notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid,
from the Issue Date. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprising twelve 30-day months,
and in the case of an incomplete month, the number of days elapsed. The redemption price at final maturity for the
notes will be 100% of their principal amount.

Principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the notes will be payable at the office of the Paying
Agent (as defined below under “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes”).

The notes will be issued in denominations of €100,000 and any integral multiple of €1,000 in excess
thereof.

**Ranking and Guarantees**

The notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer, ranking pari passu in right of payment with all other
existing and future senior obligations of the Issuer, including obligations under other unsubordinated Indebtedness.
The notes will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are secured by
Liens on any property or assets of the Issuer, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such obligations,
and will rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are, by their terms,
subordinated in right of payment to the notes.


-----

The Issuer’s obligations under the notes and the Indenture will be unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and
severally, by:

    - Parent and, except as described below, each of Parent’s present and future Domestic Subsidiaries as well
as subsidiaries organized in Canada (each, a “Canadian Subsidiary”), Germany (each, a “German
_Subsidiary”), England (each, a “U.K. Subsidiary”), France (each, a “French Subsidiary”) Luxembourg_
(each, a “Luxembourg Subsidiary”), Mexico (each, a “Mexican Subsidiary”), the Netherlands (each, a
“Dutch Subsidiary”) and Switzerland (each, a “Swiss Subsidiary”) that from time to time is an obligor
under the Existing Credit Facility or that Guarantees or otherwise becomes liable with respect to any
Indebtedness of the Issuer, Parent or any other Guarantor including, without limitation, the Existing Credit
Facility unless the incurrence of such Subsidiary Guarantee is prohibited by the laws of the jurisdiction of
incorporation or formation of such Subsidiary; and

    - subject to applicable law and excepts as described below, each of the Issuer’s present and future
Subsidiaries that from time to time Guarantees or otherwise becomes liable with respect to any
Indebtedness of the Issuer, Parent or any other Guarantor including, without limitation, the Existing Credit
Facility, or is otherwise an obligor under the Existing Credit Facility unless the incurrence of such
Guarantee is prohibited by the laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation or formation of such Subsidiary.

On the Issue Date, the notes will be guaranteed by (i) Parent and each of Parent’s Domestic Subsidiaries
that are guarantors under the Existing Credit Facility from time to time (other than Crown Americas Capital Corp.,
Crown Americas Capital Corp. V and Crown Americas Capital Corp. VI), (ii) certain of Parent’s Canadian
Subsidiaries, German Subsidiaries, U.K. Subsidiaries, French Subsidiaries, Luxembourg Subsidiaries, Dutch
Subsidiaries, and Swiss Subsidiaries, subject to limited exceptions and applicable laws (including laws and case law
relating to corporate benefit or interest, capital, capital preservation, financial assistance or transaction undervalue),
and (iii) each of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries organized in France, Germany, Mexico and one subsidiary in the
Netherlands, subject to limited exceptions and applicable laws (including laws and case law relating to corporate
benefit or interest, capital, capital preservation, financial assistance or transaction undervalue). None of (1) the
Issuer’s Subsidiaries incorporated in African or Asian nations, Belgium, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg,
Russia, Slovakia and Turkey and (2) Parent’s other Foreign Subsidiaries (other than, subject to applicable law and
exceptions described herein, certain Subsidiaries of Parent incorporated in Canada, Germany, France, Luxembourg,
Mexico, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Switzerland) which are not also Subsidiaries of the Issuer, are
expected to Guarantee the notes. Because of limitations and restrictions under local law, one or more Subsidiaries
of Parent that do not Guarantee the notes may be borrowers or guarantors under the Existing Credit Facility from
time to time.

Each Note Guarantee will be a senior obligation of the respective Guarantor, ranking pari passu in right
of payment with all other senior obligations of such Guarantor, including obligations under other unsubordinated
Indebtedness. Each Note Guarantee will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future obligations of such
Guarantor secured by Liens on any property or assets of such Guarantor, to the extent of the value of the collateral
securing such obligations, and will rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future obligations of such
Guarantor that are, by their terms, subordinated in right of payment to the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor.

The notes will be effectively subordinated to the obligations of Subsidiaries of Parent (other than the Issuer)
that do not Guarantee the notes. As of June 30, 2024, Parent’s Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) that do not
Guarantee the notes had approximately $297 million of outstanding Indebtedness.

The Guarantors will Guarantee the notes on the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture.

A Note Guarantee of a Guarantor (other than Parent) will be unconditionally released and discharged upon
any of the following:

    - any Transfer (including, without limitation, by way of consolidation or merger) by Parent or any
Subsidiary to any Person that is not Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent of all of the Equity Interests of, or all
or substantially all of the properties and assets of, such Guarantor;


-----

    - any Transfer directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, by way of consolidation or merger) by
Parent or any Subsidiary to any Person that is not Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent of Equity Interests of
such Guarantor or any issuance by such Guarantor of its Equity Interests, such that such Guarantor ceases
to be a Subsidiary of Parent; provided that such Guarantor is also released from all of its obligations in
respect of Indebtedness under each Credit Facility;

    - the release of such Guarantor from all obligations of such Guarantor in respect of Indebtedness under each
Credit Facility, except to the extent such Guarantor is otherwise required to provide a Guarantee pursuant
to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Note Guarantees”; or

    - upon the contemporaneous release or discharge of all Guarantees by such Guarantor which would have
required such Guarantor to guarantee the notes pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain
Covenants—Additional Note Guarantees.”

Except as provided under “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets,” a note
Guarantee of Parent may be released and discharged only with the consent of each Holder of notes to which such
Note Guarantee relates.

No such release or discharge of a Note Guarantee of a Guarantor shall be effective against the Trustee or
the Holders of notes to which such Note Guarantee relates (i) if a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing under the Indenture as of the time of such proposed release until such time as such Default or
Event of Default is cured or waived (unless such release is in connection with the sale of the Equity Interests in such
Guarantor constituting collateral for a Credit Facility in connection with the exercise of remedies against such Equity
Interests or in connection with a Transfer permitted by the Indenture if, but for the existence of such Default or
Event of Default, such Subsidiary would otherwise be entitled to be released from its Note Guarantee following the
sale of such Equity Interests) and (ii) until the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an officers’ certificate, upon
which the Trustee shall be entitled but not obligated to rely, stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the
Indenture relating to such transactions have been complied with and that such release and discharge is authorized
and permitted under the Indenture. At the request of the Issuer, the Trustee shall execute and deliver an instrument
evidencing such release.

By its terms, the Guarantee of each Subsidiary Guarantor will limit the liability of each such Guarantor to
the maximum amount it can pay without its Note Guarantee being deemed a fraudulent transfer, and the Note
Guarantees of Parent’s and the Issuer’s Subsidiary Guarantors organized in certain jurisdictions, including, without
limitation, Canada, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Mexico and Luxembourg, will contain
language limiting the amount of indebtedness guaranteed or qualifying the Note Guarantee in order to address
applicable local law considerations (including preservation of share capital and statutory reserves, capitalization,
prohibited financial assistance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective
shareholders and directors). In particular, the Note Guarantee given by any Guarantor organized under French law
will be limited as to each French Subsidiary Guarantor or its subsidiaries, to the extent required by French law, to
an amount that represents either (i) the amount of such proceeds made available to such French Subsidiary Guarantor
via intergroup loans or otherwise or (ii) the equivalent in Euros of the portion of the proceeds of the notes used
directly or indirectly to repay or refinance obligations of, or obligations guaranteed (to the extent permitted under
French law) by, such French Subsidiary Guarantor or its subsidiaries, or to fund or refinance (directly or indirectly)
advances or loans to such French Subsidiary Guarantor from time to time. The enforcement of the Note Guarantees
given by each French Subsidiary Guarantor or its subsidiaries will further be limited to the extent required by
applicable law to the maximum amount such French Subsidiary Guarantor can pay without exceeding its financial
capacity or otherwise resulting in insolvency of the Guarantor as of the date the Note Guarantee is subscribed or, if
later further amended, restated or reaffirmed, as of such later date. See “—Certain Bankruptcy and Fraudulent
Transfer Limitations,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The Notes and the Note Guarantees may be
voidable, subordinated or limited in scope under insolvency, fraudulent transfer, corporate or other laws” and “—
Insolvency and administrative laws could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the notes and the Note
Guarantees.”

**Certain Bankruptcy and Fraudulent Transfer Limitations**


-----

Fraudulent transfer, insolvency and administrative laws may void, subordinate or limit the notes or the
Note Guarantees and may otherwise limit your ability to enforce your rights under the notes and the Note
Guarantees. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Insolvency and administrative laws could limit your ability
to enforce your rights under the notes and the Note Guarantees.”

**European Union**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of Member States of the European Union.
Under the Council Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast) (the “EU
_Insolvency Regulation”), if a debtor is located in the European Union (other than Denmark), the courts of a Member_
State shall have jurisdiction over the main insolvency proceedings if the center of the debtor’s main interests (as
that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated in that Member State. The determination
of where a debtor has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member
States may have differing and even conflicting views.

Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the center of main interests, or COMI of a
“debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which
_is ascertainable by third parties.” It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a rebuttable presumption that a debtor_
has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. This
presumption shall only apply if the registered office of the legal person has not been moved to another Member
State within the 3-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital (30) provides
that it should be possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central administration is located in a Member State
other than that of its registered office and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a
manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual center of management and supervision and the
management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Under the previous EU insolvency regulation
(Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000) which defined the COMI in similar terms, the courts have
taken into consideration a number of factors in determining a debtor’s COMI, including in particular where board
meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the
location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and
may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent
jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

If a debtor’s COMI is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has
its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation
would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to
commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency
proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other
EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another Member
State.

If a debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary
(territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the
meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member
State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in the 3-month period prior to the request for commencement
of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where the debtor
_carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to commence main insolvency proceedings_
_a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.”_

Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI,
any proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment
shall be secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such proceedings are restricted to the assets of the
debtor located in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which
the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, secondary insolvency proceedings may only be
commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency


-----

proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that
Member State’s law or (ii) the secondary insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of (x) a creditor
which is domiciled, habitually resident or has its registered office in the other Member State or whose claim
arises from the operation of the establishment or (y) a public authority that has the right to make such a request
under the law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency
proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions,
be governed by the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency
proceedings of the debtor (lex fori concursus).

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court
commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no
secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a
Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located
there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such
as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no
insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been
taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where
the debtor has assets.

Please also note that the EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20,
2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to
increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending
Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring Directive”) was
published on June 20, 2019.

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs
that are in financial difficulty have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them
to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e. individuals) can benefit from a full
discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness
of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to
shortening their length.

The Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring,
insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive
restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to
promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage,
when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most
notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement
actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims
shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests based on verifiable
criteria (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor
claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the
amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties
in each class or, where applicable, of the number of affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down
is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors
even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In
order to be adopted the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular,
ensure the protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption
of the plan. The transposition of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new financing and
interim financing and may also, subject to member states’ discretion, provide priority ranking to new or interim
financing granted in the context of the restructuring.

The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States by
July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for
which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17, 2024 or, in others, on July 17,


-----

2026), subject to a maximum 1 year extension of the transposition period for Member States encountering particular
difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive.

**United Kingdom**

Certain guarantors are organized under the laws of England. On December 31, 2020, the end of the
transition period occurred under the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community. Accordingly, the United
Kingdom is no longer treated as a member state for the purposes of the Recast Insolvency Regulation. Whilst, the
EUWA provides that direct EU legislation (which term includes any EU regulation as it had effect in EU law
immediately before exit day (subject to certain exceptions)) converts directly applicable EU law (which includes
regulations) as it stood at the end of the transition period into UK domestic law, such EU legislation may be subject
to a number of amendments. In light of Brexit and pursuant to Article 67, par. 3 of the EUWA, the Recast Insolvency
Regulation will continue to apply in the UK to insolvency procedures started before the end of the transition period,
i.e., before December 31, 2020.

The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (the “Exit Regulations”), sets out
a number of amendments made to the Recast Insolvency Regulations, as it applies in the United Kingdom now the
transition period has ended. On December 30, 2020 the European Union and the United Kingdom formally signed
the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. This agreement provisionally applied from January 1, 2021 and
entered into force on May 1, 2021. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not include a replacement for the
automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU and vice versa as under the Recast Insolvency
Regulation. In the absence of an agreement allowing automatic recognition, it will be harder for UK office holders
and UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and to effectively deal with
assets located in EU member states. Much will then depend upon the private international law rules in the particular
EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk. In
particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder has been made in reliance on a UK domestic
approach rather than the COMI rules, it is much less certain that there will be recognition in the relevant EU member
state.

**France**

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of prevention of corporate difficulties and insolvency
proceedings governed by French law for information purposes only and does not address all the French legal
considerations that may be relevant to holders of the notes.

Any pre-insolvency and insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer or its Subsidiaries incorporated
in France would likely proceed under the laws of France. French laws and proceedings affecting creditors include
Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (Code civil), ad hoc agency proceedings (mandats ad hoc), conciliation
proceedings (procédure de conciliation), safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde), accelerated safeguard
proceedings (sauvegarde accélérée) and judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (redressement or
_liquidation judiciaire). French pre-insolvency and insolvency legislation generally favors the continuation of a_
business and protection of employment over payment of creditors. The following is a general discussion of
insolvency proceedings governed by French law for information purpose only and does not address all the French
law considerations that may be relevant to creditors.

Under the EU Insolvency Regulation, if a debtor is located in the European Union (other than Denmark),
French courts shall have jurisdiction over the main insolvency proceedings if the center of the debtor’s main interests
is situated in France. In the case of a company or legal person, the place of the registered office shall be presumed
to be the center of its main interests in the absence of proof to the contrary. In determining whether the center of
main interests of a company is in France, French courts will take into account a broad range of factual elements.

Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, judicial reorganization
and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation.


-----

On September 15, 2021, French government’s ordinance n°2021-1193 and its implementation decree No
2021-1218 dated 23 September 2021 transposed EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the
Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and
on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt,
and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “Restructuring Directive”)
into French law (the “Transposition Ordinance”).

The Transposition Ordinance entered into force on October 1, 2021, subject to very limited exceptions, and

is applicable to all pre-insolvency and insolvency proceedings opened as from said date. The Transposition
Ordinance provides for significant changes of French insolvency law (especially with regards to the structure and
approval process of restructuring plans).

Kindly note that case law is almost non-existent, given that the Transposition Ordinance is quite recent.

References made to the Transposition Ordinance in this Offering Memorandum should be read as
applicable to proceedings opened from October 1, 2021. The elements provided for in the Offering Memorandum
are therefore a mere description of the provisions of the Transposition Order and should be read with care and taking
the assumption that their understanding may still evolve in a near future.

**_Grace periods_**

In addition to pre-insolvency and insolvency laws discussed below, the Holders of the notes could, like
any other creditors, be subject to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code.

Pursuant to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code, French courts may, in any civil or commercial
proceedings involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, take into account the debtor’s
financial position and the creditor’s financial needs, defer or otherwise reschedule the payment dates or payment
obligations over a maximum period of two years. In addition, pursuant to Article 1343-5, if a debtor specifically
initiates proceedings thereunder, French courts may decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus
deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate which is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the
legal rate, as published annually by the French government) or that payments made shall first be allocated to
repayment of principal. If a court order under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code is made, it will suspend any
pending enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or
be due during the grace period ordered by the court. A creditor cannot contract out of such provisions. When the
debtor benefits from a conciliation proceeding, these statutory provisions shall be read in combination with Article
L.611-10-1 and Article L.611-7 of the French Commercial Code (see “—Conciliation proceedings”).

**_Warning Procedure (procédure d’alerte)_**

In order to anticipate a debtor’s difficulties to the extent possible, French law provides for certain warning
procedures. When there are elements which the statutory auditors of a company believe put the company’s existence
as a going concern in jeopardy, they can request the management to provide an explanation for the situation (Stage
1 of the warning procedure). Failing satisfactory explanations or corrective measures by management, the auditors
must request that the board of directors (or the equivalent body) be convened and may request to be heard by the
president of the relevant commercial court (Stage 2 of the warning procedure). The minutes of the board of directors’
meeting are sent to the employee representatives during Stage 2, as Stage 1 proceedings are confidential.

If, despite of the statutory auditors’ request, the board of directors (or an equivalent body) has not been
convened, if the statutory auditors have not been summoned to the meeting of the board, or if the statutory auditors
conclude that in the context of this meeting satisfactory explanations have not been given and appropriate corrective
measures have not been taken by management, then management must convene a shareholders’ meeting at which


-----

the auditors present a special report on the state of the company. This report is also sent to the employee
representatives (Stage 3 of the warning procedure). In practice, the statutory auditors commonly invite the
management to convene a shareholders’ meeting. If management fails to act, then the statutory auditors convene the
shareholders’ meeting themselves and set the agenda. If the statutory auditors consider that decisions made by the
shareholders during the shareholders’ meeting do not ensure the company’s existence as a going concern, they must
inform the president of the relevant commercial court of the warning procedure and may also request to be heard on
the matter (Stage 4 of the warning procedure).

Shareholders representing at least 5% of the share capital and the workers’ committee, or, in their absence,
the employees’ representatives have similar rights.

The President of the Commercial Court can also himself request the management to provide explanations
on elements which the President of the court believes put the company’s existence as a going concern in jeopardy,
or when the company has not filed its financial statements within the statutory timeframe, despite his injunction.

If the statutory auditors consider the state of the relevant company to require immediate action, and has
determined that the director is refusing to take such action or is taking insufficient measures, the statutory auditors
may inform the president of the relevant commercial court concurrently with their initial report made to the director,
the chairman of the board of directors (conseil d’administration) or of the supervisory board (conseil de
_surveillance), as the case may be._

In such case, the statutory auditors may communicate by any means and without delay to the president of
the court their findings and proceedings and may produce copies of any relevant documents and may also, at any
time request to be heard, together with the board of directors (or an equivalent body), by the President of the Court.

This exceptional procedure does not preclude the application of the ordinary procedure detailed above.

**_Insolvency test_**

Under French law, a company is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) when it is
unable to pay its debts as they fall due with its immediately available assets, taking into account available credit
lines, existing debt rescheduling agreements and moratoria.

The date of insolvency (état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court
order commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier
date, which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such court ruling. Except for fraud, the date of
insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement
(homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the
hardening period (see below).

**_Court-assisted informal proceedings and court-administered insolvency proceedings_**

**_Court-assisted proceedings—Appointment of an ad hoc officer and conciliation proceedings_**

**_Generalities on mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings_**

Pre-insolvency proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor company itself, in its sole discretion;
provided that it experiences or anticipates legal, economic or financial difficulties:

(i) while not being in a state of cessation des paiements in case of mandat ad hoc or conciliation
proceedings, or


-----

(ii) while not being in a state of cessation des paiements for more than 45 days in case of conciliation
proceedings only.

_Mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings are informal and confidential (subject to the details below as_
regards conciliation proceedings) proceedings carried out under the supervision of the President of the court. The
President of the competent court will appoint a trustee (as the case may be, a mandataire ad hoc or a conciliateur)
in order to help the debtor company reach an agreement with its main creditors and stakeholders, in particular by
reducing or rescheduling its indebtedness. The debtor may propose, in the filing for the commencement of the
proceedings, the appointment of a particular person as trustee. Such proceedings are non-binding since the courtappointed trustee has no power to force the parties to accept an agreement and the dissenting creditors will not be
bound by the arrangement, if any. Creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the company to recover
their claims, but, in practice, they generally abstain from doing so, to try and negotiate a consensual restructuring.
Should creditors decide to take legal action, the seized court can, at any time, granted the debtor a grace period that
can last up to 24 months.

_Mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used at the request of the debtor and after the_
opinion of the participating creditors has been sought to prepare the sale of all or part of the business of the debtor
with a view to implement such sale (plan de cession) in subsequent court-administered proceedings. Provided that
they comply with certain requirements, any offers received in this context by the _mandataire ad hoc or the_
_conciliateur may be directly considered by the court in the context of safeguard, reorganization or liquidation_
proceedings after consultation of the public prosecutor.

Contractual provisions modifying the terms of an outstanding contract, by diminishing the rights or
increasing the obligations of the debtor solely by reason of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or the opening
of conciliation proceedings, or any request made to this end are deemed null and void.

Equally, contractual provisions that would, as the sole result of the opening of a mandat ad hoc proceeding
or the opening of conciliation proceedings, make the debtor bear the fees of the creditor’s counsel relating to such
proceedings for the portion that would exceed three quarters of the total fee of the relevant counsel are null and
void.

**_Mandat ad hoc proceedings_**

French law does not provide for any specific rule in respect of the organization of a _mandat ad hoc_
proceedings. Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not involve any automatic stay of the claims and pending proceedings.
The debtor’s statutory auditors, if any, shall be notified of the order appointing the _mandataire ad hoc_ for
information purposes.

A French company that is facing any type of difficulties (but which is not insolvent) may request from the
court, in its sole discretion, the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc, whose identity it can suggest.

The mandataire ad hoc’s duties and the duration of the proceeding are freely determined by the President
of the competent court. Such mandataire ad hoc is usually appointed in order to facilitate negotiations with creditors
but cannot coerce the creditors into accepting any proposal. The agreement reached by the parties (if any) with the help
of such mandataire ad hoc can be reported by the latter to the president of the court but is not formally approved by
the court. The restructuring agreement between the company and its main creditors is negotiated on a purely consensual
and voluntary basis; those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the arrangement. Creditors are not
barred from taking legal action against the company to recover their claims but, in practice, they usually accept not to
do so. Mandat ad hoc proceedings are confidential and the debtor does not need to inform employees’ representative.

In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period pursuant to Article
1343-5 of the French Civil Code, as set forth above (see “—Grace periods”).


-----

Any contractual provision that modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by
reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation of a mandataire ad hoc
or of a request submitted to this end, and any contractual provision requiring the debtor to bear, by reason only of
the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc, more than three-quarters of the fees of the professional advisers retained
by creditors in connection with these proceedings, are deemed null and void.

**_Conciliation proceedings_**

A French company facing difficulties without being insolvent, or being insolvent for less than 45 calendar
days (see “—Insolvency test”), may request the opening of conciliation proceedings (procédure de conciliation), the
aim of which is to reach an agreement with the debtor’s main creditors and stakeholders.

Similarities between the conciliation proceedings and the mandat ad hoc proceedings are (i) confidentiality
by law and (ii) they may only be initiated by the debtor company itself, in its sole discretion. Main differences
include (i) conditions to open conciliation proceedings, (ii) the limitation in time of conciliation proceedings, (iii)
the right to petition the president of the court for a grace period, and (iv) the ability to have acknowledged or
approved the conciliation agreement.

Additionally, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having
commenced conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of a conciliation agreement (whether it is
acknowledged or approved as described below), impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate in
the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put the debtor
on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement, such
decision being taken after hearing the conciliator if he/she has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the
agreement. These grace periods granted during the execution period of the conciliation agreement would benefit
those persons who are co-obligated or who have granted a personal security interest or who have pledged or assigned
property as security, pursuant to the Transposition Ordinance.

Such company may apply for the opening of conciliation proceedings (procédure de conciliation) with
respect to itself if it experiences current or predictable legal, economic or financial difficulties. It petitions the
president of the relevant Court (usually the Commercial Court) for the appointment of a conciliator (conciliateur)
(whose name it can suggest) in charge of assisting the debtor in negotiating with some or all of its creditors and/or
trade partners an agreement providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness.

Pursuant to the Transposition Ordinance and for all conciliation opened from October 1, 2021 (included)
onwards, Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code is amended to provide that during the course of the
conciliation proceeding, the judge having opened the conciliation proceedings has jurisdiction to grant a grace period
to the debtor against a creditor, in accordance with Article 1343-5 et seq. of the French Civil Code, provided that (i)
the debtor has received a formal notice requesting payment or faces enforcement from such creditor or (ii) the debtor
faces enforcement measures, or (iii) if such creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request
made by the conciliator to suspend payment of his claim. In this last situation (creditor’s refusal), the judge has the
power to grant a deferral or rescheduling of the creditor’s (i) due claims up to a maximum of 24 months and (ii)
unmatured claims for a maximum period which would correspond to the remaining period of the conciliation
proceedings. Conciliation proceedings are confidential (subject to certain exceptions, such as the notification to the
debtor’s auditors of the order appointing the conciliateur), and may last up to four months (with the conciliator
being able to request one month extension up to a total duration of five months). During the proceedings, creditors
may continue to sue individually for payment of their claims but they usually accept not to do so.

In addition, if a creditor seeks payment (subject to the Transposition Ordinance provisions described
below), pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having opened the conciliation
proceedings has jurisdiction to grant a grace period to the debtor, in accordance with Article 1343-5 et seq. of the
French Civil Code, provided that the debtor has received a formal notice requesting payment or faces enforcement
measures, in which case the decision would be taken after having heard the conciliator and the judge may limit the
duration of the measures it orders to the conclusion of an agreement in the framework of conciliation proceedings.
Persons who are co-obligated or who have granted a personal security interest or who have pledged or assigned


-----

property as security benefit from the grace period granted to the debtor pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French
Commercial Code. This conciliation agreement may be either acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the court
or approved by the court. It will become binding upon them and the creditors party thereto may not take action
against the company in respect of claims governed by the conciliation agreement. The President of the court can, at
the request of the debtor, appoint the conciliator to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à
_l’exécution de l’accord) during its execution. The conciliation agreement can also be approved (homologué) by the_
court upon the debtor’s request following a hearing held for that purpose (which will be attended by the works
council or employee representatives), as the case may be, if (i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation
agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency, (ii) the conciliation agreement effectively
ensures that the company will survive as a going concern, and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the
rights of the non-signatory creditors.

It will make the conciliation public and have the following specific consequences:

  - the decision of approval by the relevant court, which should only disclose the amount of any New Money
Lien (see below) and the guarantees and security interests granted will be public but the agreement itself
should otherwise remain confidential except vis-à-vis the works council or employee representatives, that
are informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation
agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the Court; creditors who provided new money, goods or services
designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than shareholders providing new
equity in the context of a capital increase) will have priority of payment over all pre-petition and postpetition claims (other than certain pre- petition employment claims and post- petition procedural costs), in
the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation
proceedings (the “New Money Lien”);

  - when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated to its
statutory auditors;

  - in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation
proceedings, the claims benefiting from the New Money Lien may not, without their holders’ consent, be
written off and their payment date may not be rescheduled to a date later than the date on which the
safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted, not even by the classes of Affected Parties (as defined below);

  - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date
of the cessation des paiements and therefore the commencement date of the hardening period (période
_suspecte) (as defined below, see “—The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization_
_and liquidation proceedings”) cannot except in case of fraud (see “—Fraudulent conveyance in France”)_
be set by the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval (homologation) of the agreement (see
definition of the date of the cessation des paiements in “—Insolvency tests”) the court decision approving
the conciliation agreement does not make its terms public (save for the information of the works council
or the employees representatives, if any, on the content of the agreement) except for the guarantees and the
terms of the New Money Lien granted to the creditors under the conciliation agreement.

In the case of acknowledgement (constat) or approval (homologation), the President of the court can, at the
request of the debtor, appoint the conciliator to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à
_l’exécution de l’accord) during its execution._

While the agreement (whether acknowledged or homologated) is in force the debtor retains the right to
petition the court that opened conciliation proceedings for a debt rescheduling, pursuant to Article 1343-5 of the
French Civil Code and Article L.611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code mentioned above, in relation to claims
of credit.

In the event of a breach of the agreement, any party to the agreement that has been acknowledged or
approved in the manner described above can petition the court for its rescission pursuant to the Transposition Order,
clauses of the conciliation agreement which provide for the consequences of the rescission remain enforceable after


-----

such rescission (pursuant to the Transposition Order, provisions of the conciliation agreement which provide for
consequences of the rescission remain enforceable after such rescission). If such rescission is granted, grace periods
granted in relation to the conciliation proceeding may be revoked. Conversely, provided that the conciliation
agreement is duly performed, any individual proceeding by creditors with respect to the claims included in the
agreement are suspended. The commencement subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to
the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by the payments already
received) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees. Conciliation proceedings, in the context of which a draft
plan has been negotiated and is supported by a large majority of creditors or that is likely to meet the threshold
requirements for creditors’ consent in safeguard is a mandatory preliminary step of the accelerated safeguard
proceedings as described below.

In the event of the commencement of subsequent safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, within
the context of the adoption of a safeguard plan or a reorganization plan, the court will not be able to impose a
payment deferral to a date later than the date on which the plan is adopted, or debt reductions to creditors with
respect to their claims benefiting from the New Money Lien without their consent.

At the request of the debtor and after the participating creditors have been consulted on the matter, the
conciliator may be appointed with a mission to organize the partial or total sale of the debtor in particular through a
“plan for the disposal of the business” (plan de cession) which would be implemented, as applicable, in the context
of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings; any offers received in this context by
the conciliator may be directly submitted to the court in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings
after consultation of the public prosecutor.

Any contractual provision that modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by
reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the commencement of conciliation
proceedings or of a request submitted to this end, and any contractual provision requiring the debtor to bear, by
reason only of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of the fees of the
professional advisers retained by the creditors in connection with these proceedings, are deemed null and void.

The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entails any specific legal consequences for
the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement of an insolvency proceedings. New
conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before three months as from the end of the previous one.

**Court-administered Proceedings—Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization and Liquidation Proceedings**

**_Safeguard proceedings_**

A company may, in its sole discretion, initiate safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with
respect to itself, provided it (i) is not insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) and (ii) experiences difficulties
that it is not able to overcome. At the opening of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed judicial administrator
(administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that such
appointment is not necessary) to investigate the business of the company during an initial observation period, which
may last up to 12 months and help the company to elaborate a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde)
that it will propose to its creditors. Creditors do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the
hands of the debtor assisted by the court-appointed judicial administrator and are overseen by the court. The courtappointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post
facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of
the management decisions (mission d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court.

In addition, creditors are required to declare to the court-appointed creditors’ representative (mandataire
_judiciaire) the debts that arose prior to the opening of the procedure (as well as the post-opening non-privileged debts)_
and are prohibited from engaging any individual lawsuits against the debtor for any payment default in relation to
such debts (see “—Status of Creditors During Safeguard Proceedings, Judicial Reorganization Proceedings or
_Judicial Liquidation Proceedings”) and the accrual of interest on loans with a term of less than one year, or payments_


-----

deferred for less than one year, is stopped. Debts arising after the commencement of the safeguard proceedings and
which relate to expenses necessary for the business’s activities during the observation period or are for the
requirements of the proceedings, or are in consideration for a service rendered to the debtor during this period, must
be paid as and when they fall due and, if such is not the case, they will be given priority over debts incurred prior to
the commencement of the safeguard proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as the New Money Lien).

If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des
_paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative_
or the public prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard
proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings.

In addition, the court may convert such safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings
(a) at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or (b) if the approval of a safeguard plan is
manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end or (ii)
judicial liquidation proceedings at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery
is manifestly impossible. In all such cases:

    - the court may decide on the conversion at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator,
the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor, except in the case of (i)(b), as described below;

    - the court may also act upon its own initiative, except in the case of (i)(b), as described below; and

    - the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the
creditors’ representative, the creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as controller (contrôleurs) (if
any), the public prosecutor and the employees’ representatives (if any).

In case of the situation described in (i)(b) above, the court would decide the conversion (i) at the request of
the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor if no draft plan was approved
by the relevant classes of Affected Parties or (ii) at the sole request of the debtor in all other circumstances.

In case of conversion of the proceedings, classes of Affected Parties (as defined below) that have already
been formed prior to the conversion would remain with the same allocation and computation of the votes, subject to
pending challenges. Ongoing process of constitution of classes shall continue notwithstanding such conversion.

As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes
immediately due and payable.

The Transposition Ordinance creates, to incent for new financings granted to debtors in the context of
safeguard or reorganization proceedings, a new safeguard or organisation privilege (the “S/R Lien”), as well as to all
new cash contributions made as part of a plan’s modification where such plan was approved as part of insolvency
proceedings opened before 22 May 2021. In this latter case and by exception, the S/R Lien will not override the
unpaid post-petition claims arising out of a continued ongoing contract for which the contracting party accepted a
deferred payment, the post-petition wages that have been covered by the Wages guarantee scheme (Assurance de
_garantie des salaires) and the unpaid privileged post-petition claims._

The S/R Lien is distinct from the existing statutory preference enjoyed by financing granted with the
approval of the bankruptcy judge, after commencement of the proceedings for the needs of the proceedings or of the
observation period.

    - The S/R Lien applies to all new cash contributions made, with the exception of those made through a
share capital increase, by any person:

a) during the observation period, in order to ensure the continuity of debtor’s business and its
sustainability, in which case such cash contributions must be authorized by the bankruptcy judge,
or


-----

b) for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan, i.e., within the plan as approved or
modified by the court, and for the purposes of its execution, it being specified that the judgment
must mention all claims benefiting from the privilege, as well as the relevant amounts.

    - Claims benefiting from the S/R Lien enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and postcommencement claims except with respect to (i) the employees’ super-privilege claims, (ii) procedural
costs, (iii) claims benefitting from a New Money Lien, (iv) pre-petition claims secured by a real estate
security interest (in judicial liquidation proceedings only) and (v) post-petition wages claims not
advanced by the French wages guarantee fund in the event of on-going or subsequent safeguard
proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings; and

    - Such claims may not be termed-out or written-off without the consent of the relevant creditors.

The S/R Lien cannot benefit shareholders as part of a share capital increase, nor (directly or indirectly) to
creditors for pre-petition debt.

During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the
commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes
of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor, is
prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the court can authorize payments for pre-commencement
debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or to recover
goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire).

Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard
plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The
rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business.

_Standard consultation:_

This applies in respect of debtors for which the constitution of classes of Affected Parties is not mandatory
(as described below) unless, upon the debtor’s request and with the consent of the supervising judge, they are subject
to the classes of Affected Parties-based consultation (see below).

In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court- appointed
creditors’ representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the proposed debt
settlement provided under the draft plan. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively.

French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and
whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal
commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is justified
by the difference in the situation of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’ representative. In
practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter
time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the length of the plan (ten years maximum except for
agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years).

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the
plan is approved are not required to be consulted.

Creditors who do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debtfor-equity-swap proposals which require the agreement of each individual creditor in writing) made to them are
deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified
to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the controllers.

If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the
shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving access
to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple majority of
the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least half of the


-----

shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to quorum and
majority shall apply.

Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de
_sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals that were_
submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting from the New Money
Lien or the S/R Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is
fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the
maturity date shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without
the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance.

Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment
adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of
the amount of each debt claim and from the sixth year onwards the amount of each annual instalment must be of at
least 10% of the amount of each debt claim (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following
the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the
amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had such creditor been paid in
accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be
essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

_Classes of Affected Parties’ consultation:_

This applies to (i) companies that (x) either employ at least 250 employees and have a net turnover of 20
million euros (y) or have a net turnover of 40 million euros, and to (ii) companies that own or control another
company, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, provided that all
the companies together reach the aforementioned thresholds. This consultation could also apply upon the debtor’s
request and with the consent of the supervising judge in the case of debtors that do not meet the aforementioned
thresholds. The consultation involves the submission of a draft safeguard plan for consideration by Affected Parties
which include:

    - creditors whose rights are directly affected by the draft plans (referred to as “Affected Creditors”);

    - all types of equity holders (whether they own common or preferred stock) and bondholders owning
securities that give future access to the share capital of the company (together referred to as “Equity
Holders” together with the Affected Creditors, the “Affected Parties”), provided that the draft plan
provides for a modification in their equity interest in the debtor, in the articles of association or in their
rights.

Only the Affected Parties are entitled to vote on the draft plan.

The classes of Affected Parties are established by the court-appointed administrator determined on the basis
of claims and rights that arose prior to the opening of the proceedings (it being noted that claims resulting from the
labour contract, pension rights pursuant to a professional retirement scheme and essential needs claims (créances
_alimentaires) are not affected by the plan). Classes shall be formed by the court-appointed administrator in such a_
way that each class comprises claims or interests with rights that reflect a sufficient commonality of economic
interests based on objective and verifiable criteria. Furthermore, class formation must respect the following
conditions:

    - creditors of secured claims (i.e., claims benefitting from a security interest over the debtor’s assets)
shall be treated in a separate class than other creditors, with regards to their secured claims;

    - classes must comply with subordination agreements entered into by the Affected Parties before the
commencement of the proceedings, provided that the Affected Parties have notified the existence of
such subordination agreements to the court-appointed administrator within 10 days of the receipt of the
notice sent by the court-appointed administrator or the publication of such notice inviting the Affected
Parties to notify the existence of such subordination agreements. Otherwise, the subordination
agreements are unenforceable in the context of the proceedings; and


-----

    - Equity Holders form one or several classes.

At least twenty one days prior to the date of the vote on the draft plan, the court-appointed administrator
shall submit to each Affected Party the methods for class allocation and for computation of the voting rights
corresponding to the affected claims or rights that enable them to cast a vote. The amount of the claims taken into
account for the computation of the voting rights is the one indicated by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditor
(commissaire aux comptes) or chartered accountant (expert-comptable). The methods used are also notified to the
court-appointed creditor’s representative. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be brought before the
supervising judge at the request of the Affected Party, the debtor, the public prosecutor, court-appointed creditor’s
representative or the court-appointed administrator.

The amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor do not give rise to voting rights.

The right of an Affected Party to vote in a class is attached to its pre-petition claim and is assigned as of
right alongside the claim itself notwithstanding any contradictory clause. The assignee of the claim will only be
entitled to receive the debtor’s proposals and to vote once the transfer has been communicated to the Court-appointed
administrator (details of how this information shall be given will be determined in a forthcoming implementation
decree). A creditor whose claim is extinguished or transferred is no longer deemed an Affected Party.

The draft plan prepared by the debtor, with the assistance of the Court-appointed administrator, is submitted
to the classes so they can vote on it. Where the thresholds applicable to specialized commercial courts are not met,
the debtor’s shareholders which are affected by the draft plan can make a non-monetary contribution to the
restructuring (e.g., by providing their experience, reputation or professional contacts).

The Transposition Ordinance provides that the classes of Affected Parties must approve or reject the
safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days from its submission (the convening terms are yet to be detailed in the forthcoming
implementation decree). This period may be increased or shortened by the bankruptcy judge upon the debtor or the
court-appointed administrator’s request, but not to less than 15 days. The plan must be approved by each class of
Affected Parties at a two-thirds majority of the cast votes. The Equity Holders’ class shall approve the restructuring
plan in accordance with the provisions applicable to the relevant extraordinary general meetings / special meetings
or mass meetings where relevant, subject to the afore-mentioned voting timetable and majority (and, as the case may
be, the clarification of the forthcoming implementation decree). Within a class of Affected Parties, the vote on the
draft plan may be replaced by an agreement which, after consultation of the class’ members, has been approved by
two-third of the cast votes.

If the draft safeguard plan has been approved by each class, the Court verifies that the following conditions
are satisfied:

    - the abovementioned provisions related to the constitution of classes of Affected Parties and of Equity
Holders are complied with;

    - the Affected Parties which share a sufficient commonality of interest within the same class are treated
equally and proportionally to their claims or rights;

    - the plan has been validly notified to each Affected Party;

    - where Affected Parties (within one class) have voted against the draft plan, none of these Affected
Parties is in a less favourable situation (as a result of the plan) than they would be if the order of priority
for the distribution of assets in a judicial liquidation or the sale price of the business (in a sale of the
business plan) were applied, or in the context of the better alternative solution if the plan was not
approved;

    - as the case may be, any new financing is necessary to implement the plan and does not unduly prejudice
the Affected Parties’ interests.

The Court can refuse to approve the plan if there is no reasonable prospect that it would (i) prevent cashflow insolvency or (ii) ensure the sustainability of the business. The court must verify that the interests of all affected
parties are “sufficiently protected”. Once approved by the court, the safeguard plan will be binding on all.


-----

If the draft plan has not been approved by all classes of Affected Parties, such plan may (at the request of
the debtor or of the court-appointed administrator subject to the debtor’s approval) be imposed on the dissenting
class(es) of creditors subject to the following conditions (cross-class cram-down mechanism):

    - the draft plan respects the conditions set out above relating to the approval of the plan by all of the
classes of Affected Parties;

    - the plan has been approved (i) by a majority of classes of affected parties comprising either a class of
secured creditors or a class of creditors ranking above the unsecured creditors or failing that (ii) by one
of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, other than the Equity Holders or any other class which
one could reasonably assume, based on the enterprise value of the debtor assessed as a going concern,
that it would not be entitled to any payment if the order of priority applicable in a judicial liquidation
or in the event of a sale of the business plan were to be applied (the “best interest” test);

    - the plan complies with the absolute priority rule (i.e., a dissenting voting class of Affected Parties must
be satisfied in full before a more junior class may receive any distribution or keep any interest under
the restructuring plan). However, at the request of (i) the debtor or (ii) the court-appointed administrator
with the agreement of the debtor, the court may decide to deviate from the application of the absolute
priority rule where such deviations are necessary in order to achieve the aims of the restructuring plan
and where the restructuring plan does not overly prejudice the rights or interests of any Affected Parties.
In particular, claims of the debtor’s suppliers of goods or services, the Equity Holders and claims arising
from the debtor’s tort liability may receive special treatment;

    - no class of Affected Parties may receive or retain more than the aggregate amount of its claims or
interests;

    - if the dissenting class(es) are class(es) of Equity Holders, it is possible to impose the plan on such
class(es), provided that:

`o` the debtor must (x) either employ at least 250 employees and have a net turnover of 20 million
euros (y) or have a net turnover of 40 million euros. These thresholds apply to companies that own
or control another company, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French
Commercial Code, provided that all the companies together reach the aforementioned thresholds;

`o` it is reasonable to assume that, upon a valuation of the debtor as a going-concern, Equity Holders
of the dissenting classes would not receive any payment or keep any interest if the normal ranking
of priorities for the distribution of asset sale proceeds in judicial liquidation proceedings, whether
piecemeal or via an asset sale plan, were applied;

`o` if the draft plan provides for a share capital increase through a cash contribution, the newly issued
shares shall be offered in preference to the shareholders (in proportion to their shareholding);

`o` the plan does not provide for the assignment of all or part of the rights of the class or classes of
dissenting Equity Holders.

The court decision is deemed to approve the amendments to the share capital distribution or to the Equity
Holders’ rights or of the bylaws provided for in the plan. The Court may appoint a trustee in charge of entering into
the requisite acts for the implementation of these changes.

The classes of Affected Parties cannot propose their own safeguard plan competing with the safeguard plan
suggested by the debtor (as opposed to reorganization proceeding - see below).

If the claim of a dissenting Affected Party relates to the breach of the best interest test, the enterprise value
shall be assessed by the court, if necessary, after ordering an expert opinion.

The endorsement ruling as well as the decision on the aforementioned best interest test claim shall be
appealable within ten days as from the vote of the classes of Affected Parties.

In the event that safeguard (or judicial reorganization) proceedings are opened against the Parent, the holders
of the notes should be treated as Affected Parties and assigned to a class of Affected Parties, provided that the


-----

contemplated plan affects the notes repayment terms and conditions. Therefore, the above-mentioned provisions
(including the cross-class cram down) could apply to the Noteholders.

The contents of the proposed plan shall comply with the following:

    - the Transposition Ordinance provides that the subordination agreement entered by the creditors before
the commencement of the proceedings must be communicated to the court-appointed administrator,
within a specific timeframe to be determined by the implementation decree; failing which those
subordination agreements cannot be enforced during the proceedings;

    - the safeguard plan must ensure that the Affected Parties sharing a common interests shall benefit from
an equal treatment and shall be treated proportionally to their claims or rights;

the content remains flexible as was the case in the previous regime and may, _inter alia, include a_
rescheduling or partial or total debt write-off (unless the debt benefits from the New Money Lien or the S/R Lien for
the current or previous proceedings), and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant
shareholder consent). The treatment of creditors being financial administrations remains the same as above.
Any substantial change in the objectives or means of the plan endorsed by the court according to the afore-mentioned
classes of Affected Parties’ rule shall follow the same (classes of affected creditors) process.


-----

**_Accelerated safeguard proceeding_**

A debtor in conciliation proceedings may request commencement of accelerated safeguard proceeding
(procédure de sauvegarde accélérée).

The accelerated safeguard proceedings have been designed to “fast-track” difficulties faced by a debtor.

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions:

    - the debtor must have its accounts certified by its statutory auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or
established by its chartered accountant (expert-comptable);

    - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applied for
commencement of conciliation proceedings;

    - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement
of the proceedings;

    - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties that it is not in a
position to overcome; and

    - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a
going concern that is supported by enough of the Affected Parties involved in the proceedings to render
likely its adoption, within a maximum of four months following the commencement of accelerated
safeguard proceedings (provided that the court has decided to extend the initial two-month duration of
the accelerated safeguard proceedings).

If the debtor does not meet the conditions that require classes of Affected Parties (see above) to be
constituted, the court shall order such constitution in the opening decision, as the opening of accelerated safeguard
proceedings is subject to the constitution of such classes.

The opening of accelerated safeguard proceedings only has effect with regards to the Affected Parties (i.e.,
those parties directly affected by the draft safeguard plan prepared by the debtor in the context of its conciliation
proceedings).

Where the debtor’s accounts show that the nature of the indebtedness makes it likely that a plan can be
adopted only by creditors having the status of financing companies, credit institutions and similar entities (i.e. those
institutions (i) referred to in articles L. 511-1 and L. 518-1 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, (ii) operating
under the freedom of establishment or the freedom to provide services in the territory of the States parties to the
agreement on the European Economic Area mentioned in Book V of the French Monetary and Financial Code and
(iii) any other entity with which the debtor has entered into a credit transaction, the “financial institutions”), as
well as by all holders of a claim acquired from such financial institutions or from a supplier of goods or services
and, if applicable, bondholders, the debtor may request the opening of accelerated safeguard proceedings, the effects
of which are limited to these creditors, in which case creditors other than financial institutions (such as public
creditors, the tax or social security administration and suppliers) are not directly impacted by the proceedings. Their
debts will continue to be due and payable in the ordinary course of business according to their contractual or legal
terms. The provisions of the present paragraph correspond to the former “Accelerated Financial Safeguard”
proceedings that existed prior to the Transposition Ordinance and that are now merged with the provisions of the
accelerated safeguard proceedings.


-----

The debtor will be prohibited from paying, to any creditor to whom the accelerated safeguard proceedings
apply, any amounts (including interest) in respect of debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings
or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the
observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor (post-commencement nonprivileged debts). Such amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan and
in accordance with its terms.

The regime applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings is broadly the regime applicable to standard
safeguard proceedings (for example, creditors will be consulted by way of a classes of Affected Parties-based
consultation on a draft accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde accélérée)).

However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners do
not apply in accelerated safeguard proceedings.

The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings is adopted following the same majority rules
as in classes of Affected Parties consultation of standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for
rescheduling, debt write-offs and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps
requiring relevant shareholder consent). The court cannot impose any debt rescheduling or cancellation in the
context of the accelerated safeguard proceedings.

If a plan is not adopted by the classes of Affected Parties and approved by the court within the applicable
deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings.

The list of claims (which shall also mention the subordination agreements communicated to the debtor by
the creditors prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings) of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings
shall be drawn up by the debtor and certified by the statutory auditor and shall be deemed to constitute the filing of
such claims for the purpose of the accelerated safeguard proceedings unless the creditors otherwise elect to make
such a filing (see “—Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or
_Judicial Liquidation Proceedings”)._

**_Judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings_**

Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) may
be initiated against or by a company only if it is insolvent (see “—Insolvency test”) and, with respect to liquidation
proceedings only, if the company’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The court cannot commence a judicial
reorganization or a liquidation proceeding on its own initiative.

The company is required to file for insolvency proceedings (or for conciliation proceedings) within 45 days
of becoming insolvent. If it does not, de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto
managers are exposed to incurring civil liability. Protective measures may also be taken in relation to assets owned
by de jure or de facto managers of the insolvent company pursuant to Article L.631-10-1 of the French Commercial
Code, on the basis of an action grounded on mismanagement having caused the cessation des paiements.

Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after
having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, after having
heard the debtor, the court may order the commencement of the proceedings which it finds most appropriate. The
same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court
considers that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. The court’s decision is only taken
after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the creditors of the
debtor appointed by the court as controllers (contrôleurs), the public prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if
any).


-----

The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation
of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order.

As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount
of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually
appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to
12 months (extendable by 6 additional months at the request of the public prosecutor by a specifically reasoned
decision), and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by elaborating a draft judicial
reorganization plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan, with the contribution of the debtor), or the sale of the
business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court- appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making
management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and
control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner
that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities.

In particular, the rules relating to creditors consultation, especially the powers of the court adopting the
judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement) in the event that at least one class of Affected Parties has rejected
the proposals made to it, are the same (see above), subject to the following provisions:

    - in the context of judicial reorganization proceedings, in addition to the debtor, the court-appointed
administrator can also request the constitution of classes of Affected Parties in the case of debtors that
do not meet the required size thresholds;

    - in the context of judicial reorganization proceedings, any Affected Party may submit a draft plan which
shall be the subject of a report from the court-appointed administrator and shall be submitted, together
with the plan proposed by the debtor, to a vote of the classes of Affected Parties provided that such
draft plan has been submitted to the debtor and the court-appointed administrator 15 days before the
date of the vote on the draft plan submitted by the debtor, at the latest;

    - a cross-class cram-down may also be requested by the court-appointed administrator with the
agreement of an Affected Party (meaning that that the cross-class cram-down mechanism can be used
without the debtor’s consent).

At any time during this observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the creditors of the debtor appointed by the court
as controllers (contrôleurs) (if any), the public prosecutor or upon its own initiative, order the partial stop of the
activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or liquidation of the company if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At
the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court.

In addition, the new S/R Lien applies in judicial reorganization proceedings (as defined and detailed above
see “Safeguard Proceedings”).

In judicial reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the
shareholders’ equity to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the
French Commercial Code, the administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire de justice) to convene a
shareholders’ meeting and to vote the restoration of the shareholders’ equity up to the amount proposed by the courtappointed administrator on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft
restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply
with the reorganization plan.

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no
reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court-appointed administrator, can order the total
or partial transfer of the business in accordance with the process for a sale of the business described below.


-----

Contrary to safeguard proceedings, where the draft plan or the plan provides for a share capital modification
or a sale of shares, approval clauses are deemed unenforceable.

If (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning of the French Labor
Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the disappearance of the company is
likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment and (iii) the modification
of the company’s share capital seems to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy
and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed
administrator or of the State prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business
and (y) if at least three months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that
the shareholders’ meetings required to approve the modification of the company’s share capital required for adoption
of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either:

    - appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders’ meeting and vote the share
capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in
the reorganization plan; or

    - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all
or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and
holding, directly or indirectly, a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the
voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in
the company’s shareholders’ meetings; any consent clause being deemed unwritten, the other
shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and request that their shares be purchased
simultaneously by the transferees.

In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the
parties, be set by an expert appointed by the court in summary proceedings.

In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new
shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration of the
reorganization plan. The abovementioned mechanism is not applicable where a cross-class cram-down applies.

If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, who
is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). No maximum time period is provided by
law to limit the duration of the judicial liquidation process. The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the
debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the
proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order for payment).

Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes of such liquidation
scenario: a liquidator (liquidateur) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period of
continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and organize such sale
of the business as a going concern via an asset sale, i.e. a sale plan (plan de cession), any third party (as construed
under French insolvency law) being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business.

As part of the bids submitted to the court, the third-party purchasers can, under certain conditions, cherrypick assets/jobs/contracts without the liabilities pertaining to them (save exceptions). The price offered for the
transferred assets is usually at a significant discount compared to their in bonis market value. The court will tend to
favor a credible sale plan, that ensures the sustainability of the business as a going concern, and the preservation of
jobs, over the payment of creditors.

Subject to certain exceptions, the court can judicially impose such a sale plan on creditors, including
secured creditors and mortgagees as a general principle, the payment of the purchase price operating to release their
security interests. By way of exception:

    - a purchaser is obliged to continue to pay the remaining instalments due to creditors having granted
financing for the acquisition of assets acting as collateral for such creditors and included in the sale of


-----

the business plan. For proceedings opened as from October 1, 2021, the Transposition Ordinance
provides that this rule is subject to the filing of a proof of claims by such creditors and that the debtor
shall be released from the payment of the outstanding instalments; and

    - only those secured creditors benefitting from a retention right (which is the case for pledges over
inventory or certain types of the pledges over shares, but not mortgagees of real estate assets) would
be entitled to retain their security interest over the asset on which they have such right (and therefore
in practice prevent it from being transferred) until repaid in full of their claim so secured or unless
reaching an agreement with the relevant parties.

Third-party purchasers may also submit combined bids in respect of all or part of the business of several
debtors subject to insolvency proceedings, in particular when the key assets are located in different legal entities
subject to insolvency proceedings. Again, the price offered for the transferred assets could be significantly lower
than their in bonis market value; or

    - a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to:

`o` launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only));

`o` sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers
have been received, (the formal authorization of the bankruptcy judge being necessary to conclude
the sale agreement with the bidder); or

`o` request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, from all potential interested purchasers to
bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders
submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such
hearing (procédure des plis cachetés).

If the court endorses a reorganization or sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it
deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

When either no overdue liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors
(extinction du passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets
(insuffisance d’actif), the court terminates the proceedings.

The court may also terminate the proceedings:

    - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the
difficulty of selling the assets; or

    - in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a mandataire in
charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits
between the remaining creditors.

Law n° 2021-689 May 31, 2021 has introduced a new insolvency procedure available up until June 2, 2023,
which is entitled “procédure de traitement de sortie de crise” and can be summarized as an accelerated and
simplified judicial reorganization proceedings for small undertakings (in terms of employees and turnover), whose
purpose is the endorsement of a debt rescheduling (the eligibility criteria are yet to be detailed in an upcoming
ministerial decree). As a result, its regime will not be discussed further herein.

**The Observation Period and its Outcome**

The period from the date of the court decision commencing the insolvency proceedings and until the court
makes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings is called the observation period (période d’observation) and
may last up to twelve months (with six additional months under exceptional circumstances and with a specifically


-----

reasoned decision upon request of the public prosecutor for judicial reorganization proceedings). During the
observation period, the court-appointed administrator investigates the business of the company.

Under safeguard proceedings, the court-appointed administrator’s mission is limited to either supervising
the debtor’s management or assisting it, and in any case helping it prepare a safeguard plan for the company. In
judicial reorganization proceedings, the court-appointed administrator’s mission is usually to assist the management
and to make proposals for the reorganization of the company, which proposals may include a reorganization or an
asset sale plan. In judicial reorganization proceedings, the court may also decide that the court-appointed
administrator will manage the company alone by replacing the debtor’s management.

At the end of the observation period, if it concludes that the company can survive as a going concern, the
court will endorse a safeguard or a reorganization plan, which will essentially provide for a restructuring and/or
rescheduling of debts which may only entail the partial divesture of assets rather than the entire business, to a third
party (a sale of the entire business is not possible under safeguard proceedings). At the end of the observation period
of judicial reorganization proceedings and alternatively to a reorganization plan, the court may determine that all or
part of the business should be sold to purchasers who have submitted bids. In such a case, the court orders such a
(partial or entire) sale in the framework of a so-called “asset sale plan” (plan de cession), which consists of
transferring assets, contracts and employees cherry-picked by the purchaser thereto, for a lump sum, in accordance
with the bid submitted by the purchaser during the observation period.

Judicial liquidation proceedings entail the relief of the debtor of the management and there is no observation
period in such proceedings. The outcome of liquidation proceedings, which is decided by the court without a vote
of the creditors, may be a sale of the business and/or isolated sales of the debtor’s assets in order to discharge the
debtor’s liabilities. Where a sale of the business (partial or not) is contemplated, the court may authorize a temporary
continuation of the business for a maximum period of three months (renewable once for a period of three months at
the public prosecutor’s request) whose effects are similar to an observation period.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, a reorganization plan or an asset sale plan, it can set a time period
during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continued business of the debtor may not be sold without
its consent.

The sales that have been pre-packed in mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings and that are deemed
satisfactory will be implemented in the framework of subsequent court-administrated proceedings through an
expeditious and derogatory process. Such sales can only relate to part (but not all) of the business of the debtor in
safeguard proceedings.

**_The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and liquidation proceedings_**

The date when the debtor becomes in a state of “cessation des paiements” is deemed to be the date of the
court order commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an
earlier date, which may not be earlier than 18 months before the date of such court order. Also, except in the case
of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved
an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is
important because it marks the beginning of the “hardening period” (période suspecte), being the period from the
insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation
proceedings affecting it.

Certain transactions entered into by the debtor during the hardening period are automatically void or
voidable by the court.

Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period
that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These
include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the reciprocal
obligations of the debtor significantly exceed those of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of
payment, payments of the debts that are due made in a manner which is not commonly used in the ordinary course


-----

of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to
serve as bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with Article 2350 of the French Civil Code, security
granted for debts previously incurred (Transposition Ordinance excludes from such automatically void situation any
new security interest which substitutes a pre-existing security interest of at least equal nature and scope and any
Dailly assignment made in execution of a framework agreement entered into prior to the cash-flow insolvency date),
provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the
date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement
(fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust
arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior
to such amendment, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité)
pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code.

The Transposition Ordinance provides that any legal mortgage attached to a sentence ruling over the
debtor’s asset securing debts previously incurred will also be automatically voided if made during the hardening
period.

“Voidable transactions” include payments for due debts made from the date of insolvency, transactions for
consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution)
and oppositions made during the hardening period if such actions are taken after the debtor was in cessation des
paiements and the court determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the
relevant time. In addition, transactions relating to transfers of assets for no consideration and notarized declarations
of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French
Commercial Code when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period.

There is no hardening period prior to the opening of safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings except
if the debtor was in fact already insolvency before the opening of the proceeding which and that the proceeding end
without the approval of a plan.

**_Extension of Insolvency Proceedings_**

French law provides that, upon the petition of the debtor, of the public prosecutor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors’ representative or the liquidator, the insolvency proceedings of a company may be
extended to another one, so that their respective assets and liabilities will be treated as belonging to one single
insolvency estate, if (i) the debtor is deemed “fictitious,” i.e. a sham, or (ii) the debtor “commingled its assets and
liabilities” with another entity, i.e. either it proves impossible to determine which assets and liabilities belong to
each of them or “abnormal financial relationships” existed between the two entities (such as transfers of assets or
funds without consideration).

**_Creditors’ Liability_**

Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code as interpreted by case law, where safeguard,
judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may be held liable for
the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor only if the granting of such facilities was wrongful
and in the case of fraud, interference with the management of the debtor or if the security or guarantees taken to
support the facilities are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support
facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable in such circumstances can be canceled or reduced by the court.

If a creditor has repeatedly interfered in the company’s management, it can be deemed a de facto manager
of such company (dirigeant de fait). In such case, Article L. 651-2 of the French Commercial Code provides that, if
judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) have been commenced against the debtor, the creditor may
be liable for bearing the excess of liabilities over the company’s assets, along with the other managers (whether de
_jure or de facto), as the case may be, if it is established that their mismanagement contributed to the company’s_
shortfall of assets. If such conditions are met, French courts will decide whether the managers should bear all or
part of the shortfall amount. The mere negligence of a de jure or de facto manager in the management of the company
is not sufficient to hold the manager liable for the company’s shortfall of assets.


-----

**_Status of creditors during safeguard proceedings, accelerated safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization_**
**_proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings_**

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the proceedings accelerates payment,
(except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the court does not order the continued operation of
the business) or terminates or cancels an ongoing contract are not enforceable against the debtor. In accordance with
a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n°12-22.909, are “contractual provisions modifying
the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the
debtor solely upon the opening of reorganization proceedings” (case law which is likely to be extended to safeguard,
or accelerated safeguard) are unenforceable. However, the court-appointed administrator must unilaterally terminate
ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) which it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform.

Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to
perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default prior the commencement of the
proceeding, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its post-petition contractual obligations (and provided
that, in the case of reorganization or liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor
pays cash on delivery). Termination of contracts may be decided by the insolvency judge (juge commissaire) upon
request of the administrator if such termination is necessary for the recovery of the debtor and does not harm
excessively the interest of the counterparty. The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically
accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business
with a view to the adoption of a “plan for the sale of the business” (plan de cession) (which it may do for a period
of three months, renewable once), in which case the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of
the court decision adopting the “plan for the sale of the business” or on the date on which the continued operation
of the business ends.

As from the court decision commencing the proceedings:

     - accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts
providing for a payment which is deferred by at least one year, with respect to which, however, accrued
interest can no longer be compounded;

     - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings,
subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the setoff of related (connexes) debts and
payments authorized by the insolvency judge appointed by the court to recover assets for which
recovery is justified by the continued operation of the business);

    - debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which were incurred for the
purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services
rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and,
if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with
certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a “New Money Lien” and S/R Lien), provided
that they are duly brought to the attention of the court-appointed administrator or, failing one, the
_mandataire judiciaire or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the court-appointed trustee in_
charge of supervising the implementation of the plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) or the
judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period.

    - in the context of judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to alternative
terms of payment with the contracting party, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant
to an ongoing contract (contrat en cours), will be required; and

     - creditors may not pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or a guarantor of the debtor
where such guarantor is a natural person) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision
commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is:

`o` to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the
creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as
described below);

`o` to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; or


-----

`o` to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor except where such asset (whether
tangible or intangible, movable or immovable) is located in another Member State within the
European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the
insolvency proceedings, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 E.U. Insolvency Regulation.
Similarly, the rights of a creditor on the debtor’s assets located outside France and the EU would
only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings if they were to be recognized by the local
courts where the assets at stake are located (unless provided otherwise in a treaty to which France
is a party); or

`o` any increase in the scope of a contractual security or a contractual right of retention, by any means
whatsoever, by the inclusion of goods or rights, or by transfer of the debtor’s assets or rights, is
prohibited. Any contrary provision, in particular relating to a transfer of property or rights of the
debtor which have not yet arisen on the date of decision commencing the proceedings, is
unenforceable. However, the increase in the scope may validly result from an assignment of a
claim provided for in Article L. 313-23 of the Monetary and Financial Code when it is made
pursuant to a master assignment agreement entered into prior to the opening of the proceedings,
or from an express derogation from this prohibition provided for in the French Monetary and
Financial Code or the French Insurance Code (Article L. 622-21 of the French Commercial Code).

A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan
adopted by the court. For proceedings open from October 1, 2021, the Transposition Ordinance provides that the
same provision will be applicable in judicial reorganization plan.

In the context of accelerated safeguard whose effects are limited only to creditors having the status of
financial institutions, the above rules only apply to the Affected Parties that fall within the scope of these
proceedings. Debts owed to other creditors, such as suppliers, continue to be payable in the ordinary course of
business.

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of
proceedings must file a claim (déclaration de créances) with the court-appointed creditors’ representative
(mandataire judiciaire) within two months of the publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin
_Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside_
France. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim and no proof of claim
has been filed yet, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing on the claim with the creditors’
representative on behalf of the debtor. Creditors are allowed to ratify a proof of claim made on their behalf until the
insolvency judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. Creditors who have not submitted their claims during the
relevant period, whose claims are not deemed filed with the creditors’ representative are, except with respect to
limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not
subject to such limitations and are preferential creditors under French law.

Beneficiaries of security interests granted by the debtor to secure third parties’ obligations also have to
comply with the proof of claim filing process.

At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator and the
creditors’ representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the
creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of
the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof
of claim so made on their behalf until the insolvency judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also
file their own proof of claim within the deadlines described above.

In accelerated safeguard however the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having taken part in
the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors. Although such creditors may file proofs of
claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust
the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time
limit). Creditors that did not take part in the conciliation proceedings must file their proofs of claim within the
aforementioned deadlines.


-----

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, or reorganization plan, claims of creditors
included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. The court can also set a time period during
which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continued business of the debtor may not be sold without its
consent.

If the court adopts a plan for the sale of the business (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial
reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment
of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the
debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator (usually the former creditor’s representative) in charge of managing the
debtor, selling the assets of the debtor and settling the relevant debts in accordance with their ranking. However, in
practice, where the sale of the business is considered, the court will usually appoint a judicial administrator to
manage the debtor during the temporary continuation of the business operations (see above) and organize the sale
of the business process.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees
(for the super-privileged part of their claims), post- commencement legal costs (essentially, court-officials fees),
creditors who, benefit from a New Money Lien or a S/R Lien (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors
and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain precommencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement
privileged creditors. This order of priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors
benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim relating to such asset.

As soon as insolvency proceedings are commenced, the immediate payment of any unpaid amount of share
capital of the debtor will be required.

The mandataire judiciaire may request that a shareholder pay-up its portion of the unpaid share capital.

**_Fraudulent conveyance in France_**

French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside insolvency
proceedings, the “action paulienne” provisions, which offer creditors protection against a decrease in their means of
recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such
person guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for
any of such person’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing
security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the
relevant person by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or
recovery plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan), insolvency proceedings of the relevant person or by any of the
creditors of the relevant person outside insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of
recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings, and may be declared unenforceable
against third parties if: (i) the person performed such acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned
or, in the case of the person’s insolvency proceedings, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a
consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the
transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such person’s creditors (existing or future) would be
prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), in which
case such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on grounds of fraudulent
conveyance. If a court found that the issuance of the notes or the granting of a guarantee involved a fraudulent
conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the notes or the granting
of such guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the
creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, Holders of
the notes may not enjoy the benefit of the notes or the Guarantees and the value of any consideration that Holders
of the notes received with respect to the notes or the Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the Holders
of the notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, Holders of the notes
might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of
the fraudulent conveyance.

**_Other Jurisdictions_**


-----

In addition, the Indenture and our other debt instruments allow us, in certain circumstances, to be succeeded
by an issuer organized in another jurisdiction. The insolvency laws of other jurisdictions may not be as favorable to
the interests of the Noteholders as the laws of France. In the event any one or more of us or any of our subsidiaries
experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions,
including jurisdictions not set forth below, insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome
of such proceedings.

**_Limitation on guarantees_**

**France**

The Issuer and several Guarantors of the notes are organized under the laws of France. For a French
company to give a Note Guarantee, certain procedural and substantive requirements must be satisfied. In
particular, under French company law a French court may, under certain circumstances, set aside a Note
Guarantee granted by a French company for the benefit of another company if the guarantor derives no corporate
benefit of its own from such transaction or if the liability assumed by the guarantor exceeds the guarantor’s
financial resources (see “—Risk Factors—Risks Related to the notes—The notes and the Note Guarantees may
be voidable, subordinated or limited in scope under insolvency, fraudulent transfer, corporate or other laws”).
The application of these provisions of French law depends on the interpretation of the facts by a French court.
Although the Guarantors organized under the laws of France have determined that they are receiving a sufficient
corporate benefit for executing a Note Guarantee, there can be no assurance that a French court would agree with
this conclusion. A French court may also refuse to enforce a Note Guarantee if it is determined that the company
granting such Guarantee was insolvent at the time the Note Guarantee was granted. In addition, a French court
may grant a debtor or guarantor a period of time to perform its obligation. Moreover, liabilities and obligations
of French guarantors may be limited by certain exceptions, (i) including to the extent any obligations which, if
incurred, would constitute prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French
Commercial Code or misuse of the corporate assets (abus de biens sociaux) within the meaning of Articles L.
241-3 or L. 242-6 of the French Commercial Code (these articles are applicable to société en commandite par
_actions and sociétés par actions simplifiées pursuant to Articles L243-1 and L. 244-1 of the French Commercial_
Code) and (ii) French corporate benefit rules.

###### United States

Under federal bankruptcy law or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, the Note
Guarantees by Parent and the Domestic Subsidiaries could be voided, and/or claims in respect of such liens or
obligations could be subordinated to all of their other debts and other liabilities, if, among other things, at the time
Parent and/or the Domestic Subsidiaries issued the related Note Guarantees, Parent or the applicable Guarantor
intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor; or received less than reasonably equivalent value
or fair consideration for the incurrence of such indebtedness and either:

    - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

    - was engaged in a business or transaction for which Parent’s or such Guarantor’s remaining assets
constituted unreasonably small capital; or

    - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law
applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, Parent or a Domestic Subsidiary would
be considered insolvent if:

     - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of all of its
assets;

     - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liabilities on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and
mature; or


-----

     - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

By its terms, the Note Guarantee of each Domestic Subsidiary will limit the liability of each such Guarantor
to the maximum amount it can pay without the Note Guarantee being deemed a fraudulent transfer, although this
provision may not be effective to protect such Note Guarantees from being voided as a fraudulent transfer. Parent
believes that immediately after the issuance of the notes by the Issuer and the issuance of the Note Guarantees by
the Guarantors, Parent and each of the Domestic Subsidiaries will be solvent, will have sufficient capital to carry
on its respective business and will be able to pay its respective debts as they mature. However, a court may not
apply these standards in making its determinations and a court may not reach the same conclusions with regard to
these issues. Whether a transferor is rendered insolvent by a transfer may depend on the actual liabilities of the
transferor, and not what the transferor knows about such liabilities at the time of the transfer, and therefore, liabilities
that are unknown, or that are known to exist but whose magnitude is not fully appreciated at the time of the transfer,
may be taken into account in the context of a future determination of insolvency, which could make it very difficult
to know whether a transferor is solvent at the time of transfer, and would increase the risk that a transfer may in the
future be found to be a fraudulent conveyance.

If a bankruptcy proceeding were to be commenced under the federal bankruptcy laws by or against Parent
or any other Domestic Subsidiary, it is likely that delays will occur in any payment upon acceleration of the notes
and in enforcing remedies under the Indenture, including with respect to the liens securing the notes and the Note
Guarantees, because of specific provisions of such laws or by a court applying general principles of equity.
Provisions under federal bankruptcy law or general principles of equity that could result in the impairment of your
rights include, but are not limited to:

     - imposition of the automatic stay;

     - avoidance of preferential transfers by a trustee or debtor-in-possession;

     - substantive consolidation;

     - limitations or delays on collectability of unmatured interest or attorney fees or other “adequate
protection”;

     - fraudulent conveyance; and

     - forced restructuring of the notes, including reduction of principal amounts and interest rates and
extension of maturity dates, over the Holders’ objections.

**United Kingdom**

Under English insolvency law, the liquidator or administrator of a company may apply to the court for an
order to set aside certain types of pre-liquidation or pre-administration transactions entered into by such company
on the grounds that such transaction constituted a transaction at an undervalue or constituted a preference, if such
company was insolvent at the time of, or became insolvent as a consequence of, the transaction and enters into a
liquidation or administration within two years (in the case of a transaction at an undervalue) or six months (in the
case of a preference, if the beneficiary of the guarantee is not a connected person or two years if the beneficiary is
a connected person) of the completion of the transaction. The grant of a guarantee by a company may in certain
circumstances be a transaction at an undervalue if it constituted a gift by such company or was made on terms that
provide that such company received no consideration, or such company received consideration of significantly
less value than the consideration given by such company. The grant of a guarantee will be a preference if it has the
effect of placing a creditor (or a surety or guarantor of the company) in a better position in the event of the
company’s insolvent liquidation than if the guarantee had not been granted. A liquidator or administrator of a
company, a person who is the victim of the relevant transaction and, subject to certain conditions, the U.K.
Financial Conduct Authority and the U.K. Pensions Regulator, can also apply to the court for an order to set aside
a guarantee granted by that company on the grounds the guarantee was a transaction defrauding creditors. A
guarantee will constitute a transaction defrauding creditors if it is a transaction at an undervalue (as outlined above)
and the court is satisfied that the substantial purpose of a party to the transaction was to put assets beyond the reach
of actual or potential claimants against it or to prejudice the interest of such persons.


-----

Expenses of the insolvent estate of a company (including, among others, expenses properly incurred by the
administrator or liquidator in performing his functions and necessary disbursements incurred in the course of
administration or liquidation) enjoy priority status and will be paid before paying the claims of any unsecured
creditors. In addition, under English insolvency law, the liabilities of any UK Provider under its Note Guarantee
would be paid in the event of an insolvency after the claims of all secured creditors and certain “Preferential” debts
of unsecured creditors which are entitled to priority under English law, such as contributions to occupational and
state pension schemes and certain wages and salaries owed to employees.

For further information, see “Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Notes—The Notes and the Note Guarantees
may be voidable, subordinated or limited in scope under insolvency, fraudulent transfer, corporate or other laws—
United Kingdom.”

**Germany**

Under German insolvency law, the insolvency administrator (and in some cases, on a derivative basis, the
company’s creditors) may under certain circumstances rescind certain pre-insolvency transactions entered into by
such company. Details are set forth in sections 129 to 146 German Insolvency Act. The insolvency administrator
may in particular seek the rescission of any legal act that directly discriminates against the creditors of such company
or is detrimental to the insolvency estate if such legal act was entered into within three months prior to the application
to open the insolvency proceedings and certain other criteria are met (Section 132 German Insolvency Act). This
may affect the enforcement of the Note Guarantees to be given by Crown’s subsidiaries organized under the laws
of Germany.

**Other**

The laws of each of the jurisdictions in which the non-U.S. Subsidiary Guarantors are organized limit the
ability of these Subsidiaries to Guarantee debt of third parties, including their parent company or affiliates. These
limitations arise under various provisions or principles of corporate law which include provisions requiring the
entry into the Guarantee to be in the corporate interest of the Subsidiary Guarantor, a Subsidiary Guarantor to
receive adequate corporate benefit from the financing, rules governing preservation of share capital and statutory
reserves, thin capitalization, financial assistance and fraudulent transfer principles. If these limitations are not
observed, the Guarantees of these Guarantors would be subject to legal challenge. In addition, laws in many of
these jurisdictions, including Canada, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands and Switzerland, will contain
language limiting the amount of debt guaranteed or otherwise qualifying the Note Guarantee in order to address
applicable local law considerations (e.g., preservation of share capital, capitalization, prohibited financial
assistance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors, its shareholders and directors). Accordingly, if
you were to enforce the Note Guarantees in these jurisdictions, your claims may be limited. Furthermore, although
the Issuer and the Guarantors believe that the Note Guarantees are generally enforceable (subject to local law
restrictions), a third party creditor may challenge these Note Guarantees and prevail in court. Likewise, the note
Guarantees may, under certain circumstances, be nullified or rescinded by the insolvency court at the request of
its trustee in bankruptcy or insolvency administrator, as applicable, or any of the Subsidiary Guarantor’s creditors.

Any enforcement of the Note Guarantees after an insolvency event of any of the Foreign Subsidiary
Guarantors will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of such Subsidiary Guarantor’s jurisdiction of
organization. The insolvency, administrative and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may be materially different
from, or in conflict with, each other and those of France and the United States, including in the areas of rights of
creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the
proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any
particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Note
Guarantees in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.


-----

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer under or with respect to a note, or a Guarantor under or
with respect to a Note Guarantee, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on
account of any present or future tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge (including penalties,
interest and other liabilities related thereto) (hereinafter, “Taxes”), unless the Issuer or such Guarantor is required to
withhold or deduct any such Taxes by law, including by the official interpretation or administration thereof by a
relevant taxing authority. If any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of the government of France or any other
jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Guarantor (or any successor Person) is organized or is a resident or does
business for tax purposes or within or through which payment is made or any political subdivision or taxing authority
or agency thereof or therein (any of the aforementioned being a “Taxing Jurisdiction”) will at any time be required
to be withheld or deducted from any payment made under or with respect to a note or a Note Guarantee, or if a holder
actually pays any such Taxes where the Issuer or Guarantor or applicable withholding agent has failed to withhold or
deduct Taxes required to be withheld or deducted from any payment made under or with respect to a note or a Note
Guarantee, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay such additional amounts (“Additional
Amounts”) as may be necessary so that the net amount received by the holder of such note (including Additional
Amounts) after such withholding or deduction by the applicable withholding agent of such Taxes (including any such
Taxes on such Additional Amounts) will not be less than the amount such holder would have received if such Taxes
had not been required to be withheld or deducted; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Additional
Amounts will not be paid:

(1) to the extent the Taxes giving rise to such Additional Amounts would not have been imposed, deducted
or withheld but for the existence of any present or former connection between the Holder or beneficial owner
of a note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over,
the Holder or beneficial owner of such note, if the Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust,
partnership or corporation) and the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (other than the receipt of such payment or the
acquisition, ownership, holding or disposition of, or the execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of,
such note or Note Guarantee);

(2) subject to the last paragraph of this section “—Additional Amounts,” with respect to any estate,
inheritance, gift, sales, transfer or similar tax;

(3) subject to the last paragraph of this section “—Additional Amounts,” with respect to any Taxes payable
otherwise than by deduction or withholding from payments under or with respect to such note;

(4) to the extent such Taxes would not have been imposed, deducted or withheld if the Holder or beneficial
owner of the note or beneficial owner of any payment on such note had (i) made a declaration of non-residence,
or any other claim or filing for exemption, to which it is entitled or (ii) complied with (to the extent legally
eligible to do so) any certification, identification, information, documentation or other reporting requirement
concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of such
Holder or beneficial owner of such note or any payment on such note (provided that (x) such declaration of
nonresidence or other claim or filing for exemption or such compliance is required by the applicable law of
the Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of the imposition,
deduction or withholding of, such Taxes and (y) at least 30 days prior to the first payment date with respect to
which such declaration of nonresidence or other claim or filing for exemption or such compliance is required
under the applicable law of the Taxing Jurisdiction, the relevant Holder at that time has been notified in writing
by the Issuer, any Guarantor or any other person through whom payment may be made that a declaration of
non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption or such compliance is required to be made);

(5) to the extent such Taxes would not have been imposed, deducted or withheld if the note had been
presented for payment (where presentation is required) within 30 days after the date on which such payment
or such note became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever is
later (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the note been
presented on the last day of such 30-day period);

(6) with respect to any payment under or with respect to a note to any Holder that is a fiduciary or partnership
or any person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment or note, to the extent that a beneficiary or
settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a member of such a partnership or the beneficial owner of such payment


-----

or note would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or
beneficial owner been the actual Holder of such note;

(7) to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld pursuant to Section 1471 through 1474 of the Internal
Revenue Code, as of the issue date (or any amended or successor version of such sections that are substantively
comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), any regulations promulgated thereunder, any
official interpretations thereof, any similar law or regulation adopted pursuant to an intergovernmental
agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States implementing the foregoing or any
agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code as of the issue date (or
any amended or successor version described above);

(8) any combination of items (1) through (7) above.

The foregoing provisions shall survive any termination or discharge of the Indenture and shall apply
_mutatis mutandis to any Taxing Jurisdiction with respect to any successor Person to the Issuer or a Guarantor._

The Issuer or the applicable Guarantor, if it is the applicable withholding agent, will make any applicable
withholding or deduction required by law and remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant authority
in accordance with applicable law. The Issuer or the applicable Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee, within 30 days
after the date the payment of any Taxes deducted or withheld is due pursuant to applicable law, certified copies of
tax receipts or, if such tax receipts are not reasonably available to the Issuer or such Guarantor, such other
documentation that provides reasonable evidence of such payment by the Issuer or such Guarantor. Copies of such
receipts or other documentation will be made available to the Holders or the Paying Agent, as applicable, upon
request.

At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to any notes is due and
payable, if the Issuer or any Guarantor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment,
the Issuer or such Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an officers’ certificate stating the
fact that such Additional Amounts will be payable and the amounts so payable and will set forth such other
information necessary to enable such Trustee and Paying Agents to pay such Additional Amounts to Holders of
such notes on the payment date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises
after the 30th day prior to any such date, the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee and
Paying Agent an officers’ certificate as described in the preceding sentence and will pay such Additional Amounts
promptly after such obligation arises. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled but shall not be obligated
to rely on each officers’ certificate until receipt of a further officers’ certificate addressing such matters.

Whenever in the Indenture or in this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context, the
payment of principal, premium, if any, interest or of any other amount payable under or with respect to any note,
such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors will pay any present or future stamp, court or
documentary Taxes or any other excise, property or similar Taxes that arise in any Taxing Jurisdiction from the
execution, issue, delivery, enforcement or registration of the notes, the Indenture, any Guarantee or any other
document or instrument in relation thereto, and the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the Holders of the
notes for any such Taxes paid by such Holders.

**Optional Redemption**

Prior to, 2029 (three months prior to the scheduled maturity date of the notes), the Issuer may redeem
the notes, at its option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date,
plus the Make-Whole Premium (a “Make-Whole Redemption”). The Indenture will provide that with respect to any
such redemption the Issuer will notify the Trustee of the Make-Whole Premium with respect to the notes promptly
after the calculation and the Trustee will not be responsible for verifying such calculation.

At any time on or after, 2029 (three months prior to the scheduled maturity date of the notes), the
Issuer may redeem the notes, at its option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price


-----

equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
applicable redemption date.

Any such redemption or notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions
precedent.

In addition, the Issuer may acquire notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open
market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable securities laws, so long as
such acquisition does not otherwise violate the terms of the Indenture.

**Redemption of Notes for Changes in Withholding Taxes**

The Issuer may, at its option, redeem all, but not less than all, of the then outstanding notes at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption
date. This redemption applies only if as a result of any amendment to or change in the laws or treaties (including
any rulings or regulations promulgated thereunder) of any Taxing Jurisdiction, or any amendment to or change in
any official position of a taxing authority in any Taxing Jurisdiction concerning the interpretation, administration
or application of such laws, treaties, rulings or regulations (including by virtue of a holding by a court of competent
jurisdiction), which amendment or change in each case is announced and effective on or after the Issue Date (or, (i)
in the case of Additional Amounts payable by a successor Person to the Issuer, the date on which such successor
Person became such pursuant to applicable provisions of the Indenture or (ii) in the case Additional Amounts caused
by a tax imposed by a jurisdiction that became a Taxing Jurisdiction after the Issue Date, the date on which such
jurisdiction became a Taxing Jurisdiction), the Issuer has become or will become obligated to pay material
Additional Amounts (as described above under “—Additional Amounts”) on the next date on which any amount
would be payable with respect to such notes and the Issuer reasonably determines in good faith that such obligation
cannot be avoided (including, without limitation, by changing the jurisdiction from which or through which payment
is made) by the use of reasonable measures available to the Issuer.

Notice of such redemption may not be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the
Issuer of such notes would be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts were a payment in respect of such notes
then due nor later than 180 days after such amendment or change referred to in the preceding paragraph. At the time
such notice of redemption is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts must remain in effect.
Immediately prior to the mailing of any notice of redemption described above, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee
(i) a certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled to elect to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of
facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer so to elect to redeem have occurred and (ii) an
opinion of independent legal counsel qualified under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction to the effect that the Issuer
or such successor Person, as the case may be, has or will become obligated to pay such Additional Amounts as a
result of such amendment or change.

**Selection and Notice Regarding Notes**

If less than all of the notes are to be redeemed at any time, selection of such notes for redemption will be
made by the Trustee in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on
which the notes to be redeemed are listed or, if such notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis; provided that no
notes with a principal amount of €100,000 or less shall be redeemed in part. Notice of redemption shall be mailed
by first class mail at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of notes to be
redeemed at its registered address. For notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear
or Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for
communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. So long as any notes are listed
on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market, any such
notice to the Holders of the relevant notes shall also be published in accordance with the requirements of the rules
of the Euro MTF Market or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, posted on the official website
of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange of any change in the principal amount of notes outstanding. If any note is to be redeemed in part
only, the notice of redemption that relates to such note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be


-----

redeemed. A new note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of
the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original note. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to
accrue on such notes or portions thereof called for redemption. Redemption amounts shall only be paid upon
presentation and surrender of any such notes to be redeemed.

Any redemption and notice thereof pursuant to the Indenture may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to
the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent.

**Mandatory Redemption**

Except as set forth below under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders”, the Issuer is not required to
make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the notes.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control Repurchase Events_**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Repurchase Event, each Holder of notes will have the right to
require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof)
of such Holder’s notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at an offer price in
cash equal to 101% of such Holder’s aggregate principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, thereon to the purchase date (the “Change of Control Payment”). Within 30 days following any Change of
Control Repurchase Event or, at the Issuer’s option, prior to the consummation of such Change of Control
Repurchase Event but after the public announcement thereof, the Issuer will mail a notice to each Holder describing
the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and offering to repurchase
notes on the purchase date specified in such notice (which must be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days
from the date such notice is mailed, other than as required by law) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”) pursuant
to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. Such obligation will not continue after a
discharge of the Issuer or defeasance from its obligations with respect to the notes. See “—Legal Defeasance and
Covenant Defeasance.”

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all notes or portions thereof (in minimum amounts of €100,000 or an integral
multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof) properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of
all notes or portions thereof properly tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee all notes so accepted together with an officers’
certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of notes (or portions thereof) being purchased by the
Issuer.

The Paying Agent will promptly remit to each Holder of notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment
for such notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to
each Holder of notes a new note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the notes surrendered, if
any; provided that each such new note will be in a principal amount of €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000
in excess thereof. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as
practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with
the repurchase of the notes as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions
of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this
covenant by virtue thereof.


-----

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Indenture will not
contain provisions that permit the Holders of the notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the notes in
the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction with respect to Parent or the Issuer.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Repurchase
Event if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance
with the requirements set forth in the Indenture with respect to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and
purchases all notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer, or (2) notice of
redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional
Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of
Control Repurchase Event, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control Repurchase Event, if a
definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control Repurchase Event at the time the Change of Control Offer
is made and such Change of Control Offer is otherwise made in compliance with the provisions of this covenant.

The Existing Credit Facility and other existing Indebtedness of Parent and its Subsidiaries contain, and their
future Indebtedness may contain, prohibitions on the occurrence of certain events that would constitute a Change of
Control Repurchase Event or require the repayment or repurchase of such Indebtedness upon a Change of Control
Repurchase Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the notes
could cause a default under the Existing Credit Facility and/or such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control
Repurchase Event itself does not. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of notes following the
occurrence of a Change of Control Repurchase Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. There
can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases and there
can be no assurance that the Issuer would be able to obtain financing to make such repurchases. The Issuer’s failure to
purchase the notes in connection with a Change of Control Repurchase Event would result in a Default under the
Indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default under such other Indebtedness.

The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change
of Control Repurchase Event may deter a third party from acquiring Parent or the Issuer in a transaction that
constitutes a Change of Control Repurchase Event. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating
to the transfer of “all or substantially all” of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although
there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition
of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a Holder of notes to require the Issuer to repurchase
its notes as a result of a transfer of less than all of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another
Person may be uncertain.

If and for so long as the notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer
in accordance with the rules of the Euro MTF Market.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture:

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Indenture will provide that Parent will not, nor will it permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, create,
incur or assume any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any Principal Property or upon the Capital Stock or
Indebtedness of any of its Principal Property Subsidiaries, in each case to secure Indebtedness of Parent, any
Subsidiary of Parent or any other Person, without securing the notes (together with, at the option of Parent, any
other Indebtedness of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent ranking equally in right of payment with the notes) equally
and ratably with or, at the option of Parent, prior to, such other Indebtedness for so long as such other Indebtedness
is so secured. Any Lien that is granted to secure the notes under this covenant shall be automatically released and
discharged at the same time as the release of the Lien that gave rise to the obligation to secure the notes under this
covenant.

“Permitted Liens” means

(1) Liens securing Indebtedness on any Principal Property existing at the time of its acquisition and Liens
created contemporaneously with or within 360 days after (or created pursuant to firm commitment financing

after the acquisition or completion of any such construction or substantial improvement;

it is merged, combined or amalgamated with or into or consolidated with, or its assets or Capital Stock are
acquired by, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or it otherwise becomes a Subsidiary of Parent, _provided,_
_however, that in each case (a) the Indebtedness secured by such Lien was not incurred in contemplation of_
such merger, combination, amalgamation, consolidation, acquisition or transaction in which Person becomes
a Subsidiary of Parent and (b) such Lien extends only to the Capital Stock and assets of such Person (and
Subsidiaries of such Person) and/or to property other than Principal Property or the Capital Stock or
Indebtedness of any Subsidiary of Parent;

(3) Liens securing Indebtedness in favor of Parent and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries;

(4) Liens in favor of or required by a governmental unit in any relevant jurisdiction, including any
departments or instrumentality thereof, to secure payments under any contract or statute, or to secure debts
incurred in financing the acquisition or construction of or improvements or alterations to property subject
thereto;

(5) Liens in favor of any customer arising in respect of and not exceeding the amount of performance
deposits and partial, progress, advance or other payments by that customer for goods produced or services
rendered to that customer in the ordinary course of business and consignment arrangements (whether as
consignor or as consignee) or similar arrangements for the sale or purchase of goods in the ordinary course of
business;

(6) Liens existing on the date of the Indenture;

(7) Liens to secure any extension, renewal, refinancing, refunding or replacement (or successive
extensions, renewals, refinancings, refundings or replacements), in whole or in part, of any Indebtedness
secured by Liens referred to in clauses (1) through (6) above or clauses (10) or (12) below or Liens created in
connection with any amendment, consent or waiver relating to such Indebtedness, so long as (a) such Lien is
limited to (i) all or part of substantially the same property which secured the Lien extended, renewed,
refinanced, refunded or replaced and/or (ii) property other than Principal Property or the Capital Stock or
Indebtedness of any Principal Property Subsidiary of Parent and (b) the amount of Indebtedness secured is not
increased (other than by the amount equal to any costs, expenses, premiums, fees or prepayment penalties
incurred in connection with any extension, renewal, refinancing, refunding or replacement);

(8) Liens in respect of cash in connection with the operation of cash management programs and Liens
associated with the discounting or sale of letters of credit and customary rights of set off, banker’s Lien,


-----

revocation, refund or chargeback or similar rights under deposit disbursement, concentration account
agreements or under the Uniform Commercial Code or arising by operation of law;

(9) Liens resulting from the deposit of funds or evidences of Indebtedness in trust for the purpose of
defeasing Indebtedness of Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, and legal or equitable encumbrances
deemed to exist by reason of negative pledges;

(10) Liens securing Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed, as of the date of such
Indebtedness is incurred, the amount that would cause the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio of Parent to
be greater than 3.00 to 1.00 as of such date of incurrence;

(11) Liens on or sales of receivables;

(12) other Liens, in addition to those permitted in clauses (1) through (11) above, securing Indebtedness
having an aggregate principal amount (including all outstanding Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (7)
above to extend, renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to
this clause (12)), measured as of the date of the incurrence of any such Indebtedness (after giving pro forma
effect to the application of the proceeds therefrom), taken together with the amount of all Attributable Debt of
Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries at that time outstanding relating to Sale and Leaseback Transactions
permitted under the covenant described below under the caption “—Limitation on Sale and Leaseback
Transactions,” not to exceed 15% of the Consolidated Net Tangible Assets of Parent measured as of the date
any such Indebtedness is incurred (after giving pro forma effect to the application of the proceeds therefrom
and any transaction in connection with which such Indebtedness is being incurred);

(13) landlords’, carriers’, warehousemen’s, mechanics’, suppliers’, materialmen’s or other like Liens, in
any case incurred in the ordinary course of business with respect to amounts (a) not yet delinquent or (b) being

conformity with GAAP shall have been made therefor;

(15) (a) Liens in the form of zoning restrictions, easements, licenses, reservations, covenants, conditions or
other restrictions on the use of real property or other minor irregularities in title (including leasehold title) that
do not (i) secure Indebtedness or (ii) in the aggregate materially impair the value or marketability of the real
property affected thereby or the occupation, use and enjoyment in the ordinary course of business of Parent
and the Restricted Subsidiaries at such real property and (b) with respect to leasehold interests in real property,
mortgages, obligations, liens and other encumbrances incurred, created, assumed or permitted to exist and
arising by, through or under a landlord or owner of such leased property encumbering the landlord’s or owner’s
interest in such leased property;

(16) Liens in the form of pledges or deposits securing bids, tenders, contracts (other than contracts for the
payment of Indebtedness) or leases, warranties, statutory or regulatory obligations or self-insurance
arrangements arising in the ordinary course of business, bankers’ acceptances, surety and appeal bonds,
performance bonds and other obligations of a similar nature to which Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary is a
party, in each case, made in the ordinary course of business;

(17) Liens securing Hedging Obligations not entered into for speculative purposes or securing letters of
credit that support such Hedging Obligations; and


-----

(18) Liens resulting from operation of law with respect to any judgments, awards or orders to the extent
that such judgments, awards or orders do not cause or constitute a Default under the Indenture.

For purposes of clauses (10) and (12) above, (a) with respect to any revolving credit facility secured by a Lien, the
full amount of Indebtedness that may be borrowed thereunder will deemed to be incurred at the time any revolving
credit commitment thereunder is first extended or increased and will not be deemed to be incurred when such
revolving credit facility is drawn upon and (b) if a Lien by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is granted to
secure Indebtedness that was previously unsecured, such Indebtedness will be deemed to be incurred as of the date
such Indebtedness is secured.

**_Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions_**

The Indenture will provide that Parent will not, nor will it permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, enter into any
arrangement with any other Person pursuant to which Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries leases any Principal
Property that has been or is to be sold or transferred by Parent or the Restricted Subsidiary to such other Person (a
“Sale and Leaseback Transaction”), except that a Sale and Leaseback Transaction is permitted if Parent or such
Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to incur Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the Principal Property to be
leased, without equally and ratably securing the notes, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Attributable
Debt with respect to such Sale and Leaseback Transaction.

In addition, the following Sale and Leaseback Transactions are not subject to the limitation above and the
provisions described in “—Limitation on Liens” above:

(1) temporary leases for a term, including renewals at the option of the lessee, of not more than three years;

(2) leases between only Parent and a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent or only between Restricted Subsidiaries
of Parent;

(3) leases where the proceeds from the sale of the subject property are at least equal to the fair market value
(as determined in good faith by Parent) of the subject property and Parent applies an amount equal to the net
proceeds of the sale to the retirement of long-term Indebtedness or the purchase, construction, development,
expansion or improvement of other property or equipment used or useful in its business, within 270 days of
the effective date of such sale; provided that in lieu of applying such amount to the retirement of long-term
Indebtedness, Parent may deliver notes to the trustee for cancellation; and

(4) leases of property executed by the time of, or within 360 days after the latest of, the acquisition, the
completion of construction, development, expansion or improvement, or the commencement of commercial
operation, of the subject property.

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_**

The Indenture will provide that (i) neither Parent nor the Issuer will consolidate or merge with or into any other
Person or Transfer all or substantially all of the properties or assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
and (ii) neither Parent nor the Issuer will permit any of its Subsidiaries to, in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions, Transfer all or substantially all of the properties or assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, in each case, to another Person unless:

(1) (a) in the case of a merger, consolidation or Transfer involving Parent, Parent is the surviving corporation
or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than Parent) or to which such
Transfer has been made is a corporation organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any State
thereof or the District of Columbia, and

(b) in the case of a merger, consolidation or Transfer involving the Issuer, the Issuer is the surviving Person or
the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer) or to which


-----

such Transfer has been made is a corporation organized or existing under the laws of a member state of the
European Union (as it existed on December 31, 2003), Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States,
any State thereof or the District of Columbia;

(2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than Parent or the Issuer, as the
case may be) or the Person to which such Transfer has been made assumes all the obligations of Parent, the Issuer
or such Subsidiary under the notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture pursuant to a supplemental indenture
or amendment of the relevant documents; and

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of the following shall be permitted:

    - the consolidation or merger of Parent with or into or the Transfer of all or substantially all of the property
or assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to Crown, other than any such merger or
consolidation or Transfer to a Subsidiary of Crown;

    - the Transfer of all or substantially all of the property or assets of Crown and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, to Crown, other than any Transfer to a Subsidiary of Crown; and

    - the consolidation or merger of the Issuer with or into or the Transfer of all or substantially all of the
property or assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to Crown, other than any such
consolidation or merger with or into or Transfer to a Subsidiary of Crown.

The foregoing will not prohibit:

    - a consolidation or merger between the Issuer and a Guarantor other than Crown;

    - a consolidation or merger between a Guarantor and any other Guarantor other than Crown;

    - a consolidation or merger between a Subsidiary (other than the Issuer) that is not a Guarantor and any
other Subsidiary other than Crown;

    - a consolidation or merger of Parent with or into an Affiliate for the purposes of reincorporating Parent
in another jurisdiction;

    - the Transfer of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of a Guarantor to the Issuer and/or any
other Guarantor other than Crown; or

    - the Transfer of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of a Subsidiary (other than the Issuer)
that is not a Guarantor to any other Subsidiary other than Crown;

_provided that, in each case involving the Issuer or a Guarantor, if the Issuer or such Guarantor is not the surviving_
entity of such transaction or the Person to which such Transfer is made, the surviving entity or the Person to which
such Transfer is made shall comply with clause (2) above.

Upon any consolidation, combination or merger of Parent, the Issuer or any other Guarantor, or any Transfer of
all or substantially all of the assets of Parent or the Issuer in accordance with the foregoing, in which Parent, the
Issuer or such Guarantor is not the continuing obligor under the notes or its related Note Guarantee, the surviving
entity formed by such consolidation or into which Parent, the Issuer or such Guarantor is merged or to which the
Transfer is made will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of Parent, the
Issuer or such Guarantor under the Indenture, notes and Note Guarantees with the same effect as if such surviving
entity had been named therein as Parent, the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, and, except in the case
of a Transfer to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent, the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, will be
released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on such notes or in respect of its related Note
Guarantee, as the case may be, and all of Parent’s, the Issuer or such Guarantor’s, as the case may be, other
obligations and covenants under such notes, the Indenture and its related Note Guarantee, if applicable.


-----

**_Additional Note Guarantees_**

The Indenture will provide that Parent will not create, acquire or suffer to exist, and will not permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to create, acquire or suffer to exist, any Subsidiary other than a Restricted Subsidiary existing
as of the Issue Date or that is acquired or created after the Issue Date; provided, however, that each

(1) Domestic Subsidiary, Canadian Subsidiary, French Subsidiary, German Subsidiary, U.K. Subsidiary,
Dutch Subsidiary, Mexican Subsidiary, Swiss Subsidiary or Luxembourg Subsidiary of Parent that from time
to time is an obligor under the Existing Credit Facility or directly or indirectly (by way of the pledge of any
intercompany note or otherwise) Guarantees or in any other manner becomes liable with respect to any
Indebtedness of the Issuer, Parent or any other Guarantor (including, without limitation, the Existing Credit
Facility), and

(2) Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that directly or indirectly (by way of the pledge of any intercompany
note or otherwise) Guarantees or in any other manner becomes liable with respect to any Indebtedness of the
Issuer, Parent or any other Guarantor (including, without limitation, Indebtedness under the Existing Credit
Facility) or is otherwise an obligor under the Existing Credit Facility, must execute a Note Guarantee (and
with such documentation relating thereto as is required under the Indenture, including, without limitation, a
supplement or amendment to the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel as to the enforceability of such Note
Guarantee), pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will become a Guarantor (unless, in each case, the
incurrence of such Note Guarantee is prohibited under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation (as
evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel)).

As of the date of issuance of the notes, the Domestic Subsidiaries Crownway Insurance Company, Crown Cork and
Seal Receivables II LLC, Crown Receivables III LLC, Crown Americas Capital Corp., Crown Americas Capital
Corp. V and Crown Americas Capital Corp. VI will not Guarantee the notes.

A Note Guarantee of any Guarantor will be subject to release and discharge as described under the caption “—
Ranking and Guarantees.”

**_Reports_**

The Indenture will provide that, whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the SEC, so long as any
notes are outstanding thereunder, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee and Holders the following:

(1) all quarterly and annual financial information of Parent that would be required to be contained in a filing
with the SEC on Forms 10-Q and 10-K if Parent were required to file such Forms, including a “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” that describes the financial
condition and results of operations of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries and, with respect to the annual
information only, a report thereon by Parent’s certified independent accountants; and

(2) all current reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K if Parent were required
to file such reports,

in each case, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations. The Issuer may satisfy its
obligation to deliver the information and reports referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above by filing the same with the
SEC.

In addition, whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the SEC, Parent will file a copy of all such
information and reports with the SEC for public availability within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
regulations (unless the SEC will not accept such a filing) and make such information available to securities analysts
and prospective investors upon request. In addition, the Issuer and the Guarantors will, for so long as any notes
remain outstanding, furnish to the Holders of such notes and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon
their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

The Issuer will also make available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through (2) of the first paragraph of
this covenant, if and so long as the notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and


-----

admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the exchange so require, at the offices of the listing
agent in Luxembourg or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such reports on the official
[website of the Issuer (www.crowncork.com).](http://www.crowncork.com/)

Delivery of such reports and information to the Trustee shall be for informational purposes only, and the Trustee’s
receipt of them shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from
information contained therein (including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture as to
which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on an Officer’s Certificate).

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the listing of the notes on the Official List of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for so long as such notes are outstanding; provided that if at any time the Issuer
determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will obtain, prior to the delisting of the notes from the Official
List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, and thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, a
listing of such notes on another recognized stock exchange or exchange regulated market in western Europe.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of Parent or of any Subsidiary of Parent, as such, shall
have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the notes, the Indenture, the Note
Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder
of notes by accepting a note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities
under the federal securities laws and under French law.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

The Indenture provides that each of the following constitutes an “Event of Default”:

(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest with respect to the notes issued thereunder;

(2) default in payment when due of principal or premium, if any, on the notes issued thereunder at maturity,
upon redemption or otherwise;

(3) failure by Parent or any Subsidiary for 30 days after receipt of notice from the Trustee or Holders of at
least 25% in principal amount of notes then outstanding under the Indenture to comply with the provisions
described under “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control Repurchase Events”;

(4) failure by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent for 60 days after receipt of notice from the Trustee or the
Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of notes then outstanding under the Indenture to comply with any
covenant or agreement contained in the Indenture (other than the covenants and agreements specified in clauses
(1) through (3) of this paragraph);

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there
may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is
guaranteed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries), whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists or is
created after the Issue Date, which default (a) is caused by a failure to pay when due at final stated maturity
(giving effect to any grace period related thereto) principal of such Indebtedness (a “Payment Default”) or (b)
results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated maturity, and, in each case, the principal
amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any such Indebtedness under which
there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $75.0 million
or more; and, in each case, Parent has received notice specifying the default from the Trustee or Holders of at
least 25% of the aggregate principal amount of notes then outstanding and does not cure the default within 30
days;

(6) failure by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to pay final judgments (net of any amounts covered by
insurance and as to which such insurer has not denied responsibility or coverage in writing) aggregating $75.0
million or more, which judgments are not paid, discharged, bonded or stayed within 60 days after their entry;


-----

(7) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to Parent, the Issuer or any other Subsidiary of
Parent that is a Significant Subsidiary or group of Subsidiaries of Parent that, together, would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary; and

(8) any Note Guarantee of any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect
(other than in accordance with the terms of such Note Guarantee and the Indenture) or is declared null and
void and unenforceable or found to be invalid or any Guarantor denies its liability under its note Guarantee
(other than by reason of release of a Guarantor from its Note Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture and such Note Guarantee).

If any Event of Default under the Indenture occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in
principal amount of the notes then outstanding under the Indenture may declare all notes issued under the Indenture
to be due and payable by notice in writing to the Issuer and the Trustee, in the case of notice by Holders, specifying
the respective Event of Default and that it is a “notice of acceleration” and the same shall become immediately due
and payable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (7) above with
respect to Parent or the Issuer, all outstanding notes then outstanding under the Indenture will become due and
payable without further action or notice. The Holders of any notes may not enforce the Indenture relating to the
notes or the notes except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to certain limitations, the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the then outstanding notes issued under the Indenture may direct the Trustee in its exercise of
any trust or power.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding under the Indenture, by
written notice to the Trustee, may (subject to certain conditions) on behalf of the Holders of all of the notes issued
under the Indenture waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture, except
a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or premium on, or principal of such notes. The
Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or
Event of Default relating to the payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in the
Holders’ interest.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the
Issuer is required, within five business days after an executive officer of the Issuer becomes aware of any Default or
Event of Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will, subject to certain surviving provisions, cease to be of further effect as to
all notes issued thereunder when:

(1) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all outstanding notes issued under the Indenture (other than notes
replaced because of mutilation, loss, destruction or wrongful taking) for cancellation; or


-----

(2) all notes outstanding under the Indenture (I) have become due and payable, whether at maturity or as a
result of the mailing of a notice of redemption as described above, or (II) will become due and payable within
one year or are called for redemption within one year, under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense or the Issuer,
and the Issuer or any Guarantor irrevocably deposits with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the
benefit of the Holders, cash in Euro, noncallable government securities, or a combination thereof, sufficient
to pay at maturity or upon redemption all notes outstanding under the Indenture, including interest thereon,

and if in either case the Issuer or any Guarantor pays all other sums payable under the Indenture by it. The Trustee
will acknowledge satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture on demand of the Issuer accompanied by an officers’
certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, upon which the Trustee shall have no liability in relying, stating that all
conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied and at the cost and expense of the Issuer.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations and the obligations of the Guarantors
discharged with respect to the notes outstanding under the Indenture (“Legal Defeasance”), except for:

(1) the rights of the Holders of the notes outstanding under the Indenture to receive payments in respect of
the principal amount of, premium, if any, and interest on such notes when such payments are due from the
trust referred to below;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the notes concerning issuing temporary notes, registration of notes,
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money
for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s obligations in connection
therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations and the obligations
of the Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the Indenture (“Covenant
Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default or
Event of Default under the Indenture. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs under the Indenture, certain
events (not including non-payment, bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events) described
under the caption “—Events of Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute an Event of Default under the
Indenture.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance under the Indenture:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the notes
issued under the Indenture, cash in Euro, non-callable government securities, or a combination thereof, in such
amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants
(such opinion shall be delivered to the Trustee and upon which the Trustee shall have no liability in relying), to
pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on the notes outstanding under the Indenture on the stated
maturity or on the applicable optional redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must specify whether
such notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in
the United States (upon which the Trustee shall have no liability in relying) confirming that (a) the Issuer has
received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the date


-----

of the Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the
effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the beneficial owners of the notes
outstanding under the Indenture will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in
the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel
in the United States (upon which the Trustee shall have no liability in relying) confirming that the beneficial
owners of the notes outstanding under the Indenture will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax
on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant
Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit (other
than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit) or
insofar as Events of Default from bankruptcy or insolvency events are concerned, at any time in the period
ending on the 91[st] day after the date of deposit;

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a
default under any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is bound;

(6) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel (upon which the Trustee shall have
no liability in relying) to the effect that assuming no intervening bankruptcy of the Issuer or any Guarantor
between the date of deposit and the 91[st] day following the deposit and assuming that no Holder is an “insider”
of the Issuer under applicable bankruptcy law, after the 91[st] day following the deposit, the trust funds will not
be subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting
creditors’ rights generally;

(7) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an officers’ certificate (upon which the Trustee shall have no
liability in relying) stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the Holders
of notes issued under the Indenture over the other creditors of the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering,
delaying or defrauding creditors of the Issuer or others; and

(8) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an officers’ certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (upon which the
Trustee shall have no liability in relying), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for relating to the
Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder of notes may transfer or exchange notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The Registrar and
Trustee may require a Holder of notes, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents and the Issuer or the Trustee may require a Holder of notes to pay any taxes and fees required by law or
permitted by the Indenture. The Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any note selected for redemption.
Also, the Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any note for a period of 15 days before a selection of notes
to be redeemed.

The registered Holder of a note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except to the extent provided in the next three succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the notes governed thereby or
any Note Guarantee issued thereunder may be amended with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in
principal amount of the then outstanding notes issued under the Indenture voting as a single class (including, without
limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, tender offer or exchange offer for such notes), and
any existing default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the notes governed thereby or any Note
Guarantee issued thereunder may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount


-----

of the then outstanding notes issued under the Indenture voting as a single class (including, without limitation,
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, tender offer or exchange offer for notes).

Except as provided in the immediately succeeding paragraph, without the consent of each Holder of notes issued
under the Indenture, however, an amendment or waiver may not (with respect to any note held by a non-consenting
Holder):

(1) reduce the principal amount of notes issued under the Indenture whose Holders must consent to an
amendment, supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal amount of or change the fixed maturity of any notes, or alter the provisions with
respect to the redemption of notes other than, except as set forth in clause (7) below, the provisions relating to
the covenant described under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders”; provided that the notice
period for redemption of the notes may be reduced to not less than three (3) Business Days with the consent
of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding notes if a notice of redemption
which remains outstanding has not prior thereto been sent to such Holders;

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any such notes;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any
such notes (except a rescission of acceleration of notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding notes issued under the Indenture and a waiver of the payment default
that resulted from such acceleration);

(5) make any such note payable in currency other than that stated in such note;

(6) make any change to the provisions of the Indenture relating to waiver of past Defaults or the rights of
Holders of notes issued thereunder to receive payments of principal of or interest and Additional Amounts, if
any, on the notes;

(7) after the Issuer’s obligation to purchase notes arises thereunder, amend, change or modify in any material
respect the obligation of the Issuer to make and consummate a Change of Control Offer with respect to a
Change of Control Repurchase Event that has occurred, including, without limitation, in each case, by
amending, changing or modifying any of the definitions relating thereto;

(8) release Parent, Crown or any other Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary from any of its obligations
under its Note Guarantee or the Indenture otherwise than in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; or

(9) modify or change any provision of the Indenture affecting the ranking of the notes or Note Guarantees
issued thereunder in a manner adverse to the Holders of notes issued thereunder.

Without the consent of any Holder of notes, the Issuer and the Trustee may amend the Indenture, the notes governed
thereby or the Note Guarantees issued thereunder:

    - to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

    - to provide for uncertificated notes in addition to or in place of certificated notes;

    - to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s obligations to the Holders of notes in
the case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s
assets;

    - to secure the notes;


-----

    - to conform the text of the Indenture, Note Guarantees or the notes to any provision of this “Description
of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was intended to be a
verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, Note Guarantees or the notes;

    - to add any Guarantor or release any Guarantor from its Note Guarantee if such release is in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture;

    - to add to the covenants of the Issuer and the Guarantors for the benefit of the Holders of the notes or to

that does not adversely affect the rights under the Indenture of any Holder thereunder in any material
respect; or

    - to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture
under the Trust Indenture Act.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment or waiver. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment or waiver.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should the Trustee in its capacity as
Trustee become a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain assets
received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee in its individual capacity is permitted to
engage in other transactions with the Issuer; however, if the Trustee acquires any conflicting interest as defined
under the Trust Indenture Act, it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to
continue as Trustee or resign.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding notes under the Indenture have the right to
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee
under the Indenture, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that in case an Event of Default of
which a responsible officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge (as provided in the Indenture) shall occur under
the Indenture (which shall not be cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power as provided in
the Indenture, to use the degree of care of a prudent person under the circumstances in the conduct of such person’s
own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or
powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder of notes issued thereunder, unless such Holder shall have
offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. The Trustee’s
fees, expenses and indemnities are included in the amounts guaranteed by the Note Guarantees.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the notes in the City of Dublin. The
Issuer will ensure that it maintains a Paying Agent having its specified office in a member state of the EU that will
not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to Council Directives 2003/48/EC and 2015/2060/EU. The initial
Paying Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC in Dublin (the “Principal Paying Agent”).

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”). The initial Registrar and transfer agent will
be Elavon Financial Services DAC in Dublin. The Registrar and the transfer agent will maintain a register reflecting
ownership of any notes in certificated, non-global form outstanding from time to time and will make payments on
and facilitate transfer of such notes in certificated, non-global form on the behalf of the Issuer.


-----

The Issuer may change the Paying Agents, the Registrars or the transfer agents without prior notice to the Holders.
For so long as the notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading
on the Euro MTF Market, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent
in accordance with the rules of the Euro MTF Market or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post
such notice on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com).

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit the
notes to trading on the Euro MTF Market. There can be no assurance that the application to list the notes on the
Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit the notes to trading on the Euro MTF Market will be
approved and settlement of the notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing. So long as the notes are listed on
the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules
of such exchange so require, notices to be given to Holders shall be made in accordance with the rules of the Euro
MTF Market or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, posted on the official website of the
[Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com).](http://www.luxse./)

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Service of process upon the Issuer or any Guarantor in any action to enforce the Indenture, the notes governed
thereby or a Note Guarantee issued thereunder may be obtained within the United States by service upon CT
Corporation System, the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ designated agent for service of process under the Indenture,
the notes governed thereby or the Note Guarantees issued thereunder. Since substantially all of the Issuer’s assets
and the assets of the Guarantors are outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against
the Issuer or the Guarantors, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium if any, and
interest on the notes, may not be collectible within the United States. In addition, judgments obtained against the
Issuer or the Guarantors in jurisdictions outside of the United States, such as France, may not be collectible in
the United States or in any jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which the judgment was obtained. In actions
brought in countries outside of the United States, courts may choose to apply their own law rather than the law
of the State of New York, which governs the Indenture, the notes and the Note Guarantees. The application of
foreign law may limit your ability to enforce your rights under the notes or the Note Guarantees.

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of any United States
federal or state court located in the City of New York in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture,
the notes governed thereby or the Note Guarantees issued thereunder or under U.S. federal or state securities laws
brought in any such court.

Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will agree under the terms of the Indenture to accept service of process
in the United States by an agent designated for such purpose, it may not be possible for investors to (i) effect
service of process within the United States upon the Issuer’s or the Guarantors’ officers and directors and (ii)
realize in the United States upon judgments against such persons obtained in such courts predicated upon civil
liabilities of such persons, including any judgments predicated upon U.S. federal securities laws, to the extent
such judgments exceed such person’s U.S. assets.

See “Service of Process and Enforceability of Liabilities.”

**Judgment Currency**

Any payment on account of an amount that is payable in Euros which is made to or for the account of any Holder or
the Trustee in lawful currency of any other jurisdiction (the “Judgment Currency”), whether as a result of any
judgment or order or the enforcement thereof or the liquidation of the Issuer or any Guarantor, shall constitute a


-----

discharge of the Issuer or the Guarantor’s obligation under the Indenture and the notes or Note Guarantee, as the
case may be, only to the extent of the amount of Euros which such holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, could
purchase in the London foreign exchange markets with the amount of the Judgment Currency in accordance with
normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the first Business Day following receipt of the
payment in the Judgment Currency. If the amount of Euros that could be so purchased is less than the amount of
Euros originally due to such Holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, the Issuer and the Guarantors shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, from and against all loss or damage arising out of,
or as a result of, such deficiency. This indemnity shall constitute an obligation separate and independent from the
other obligations contained in the Indenture or the notes, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of
action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by any Holder or the Trustee from time to time and shall
continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount
due hereunder or under any judgment or order.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the notes and the Note Guarantees will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws

of Parent immediately prior to such transaction “beneficially own” (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under

of such Person and its Subsidiaries for such period; and

charges and non-recurring restructuring charges or expenses of, a Subsidiary of a Person shall be added to

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

Rule 144A notes will be represented by one or more global Notes in definitive, fully registered form
without interest coupons (collectively, the “Restricted Global Notes”) and will be deposited with a common
depositary (the “Common Depositary”) for the Euroclear System as operated by Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V.
(“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream”) and registered in the name of a nominee of the
Common Depositary. Regulation S Notes will be represented by one or more global Notes in fully registered form
without interest coupons (collectively, the “Regulation S Global Notes”) and will be deposited with the Common
Depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name of a nominee of the Common Depositary.
The Restricted Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer
set forth therein and, in the Indenture, and will bear the legend regarding such restrictions set forth under “Notice
to Investors.”

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the offering and the issue date
of the notes (such period through and including such 40th day, the “Restricted Period”) beneficial interests in the
Regulation S Global Notes may be held only through Euroclear or Clearstream, unless delivery is made through the
Restricted Global Notes in accordance with the certification requirements described below. The Regulation S Global
Notes will bear a legend (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that the notes have not been registered
under the Securities Act and may not be offered, sold or delivered in the United States or to, or for the account or
benefit of, any U.S. person unless the notes are registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such
registration requirements is available (the “Regulation S Legend”).

Prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Note may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Restricted Global Note only upon receipt
by the Trustee of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the transferor to the effect that
such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer”
acquiring for its own account or the account of a “qualified institutional buyer” in a transaction complying with
Rule 144A and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other
jurisdictions. After the expiration of the relevant Restricted Period, such certification requirement will no longer
apply to such transfers.

Beneficial interests in a Restricted Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of an interest in a Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Restricted Period,
only upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification from the transferor (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 904 of Regulation S or Rule 144
under the Securities Act and that, if such transfer occurs prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, the
interest transferred will be held immediately thereafter through Euroclear or Clearstream. Any beneficial interest
in a Restricted Global Note or a Regulation S Global Note that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of an interest in any other global note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such global note and
will become an interest in such other global note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer
restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other global note for as long as it
remains such an interest.

Transfers involving an exchange of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Note for a beneficial
interest in a Restricted Global Note or vice versa will be effected through Euroclear and Clearstream. Accordingly,
in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal
amount of such Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of such Restricted
Global Note or vice versa, as applicable.

Except in the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in global notes will not
be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated notes. Transfers of beneficial interests in the global notes will
be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective direct or indirect
participants, which rules and procedures may change from time to time.


-----

###### Global Notes

The following description of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream is provided solely
as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement
systems and are subject to changes by them from time to time. Neither Crown European Holdings nor the initial
purchasers take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and they urge investors to contact the systems
or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

Upon the issuance of the Regulation S Global Notes and the Restricted Global Notes (collectively, the
“Global Notes”), the Common Depositary will credit, on its internal system, the respective principal amount of the
beneficial interests represented by such global note to the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and
Clearstream will credit, on their internal systems, the respective principal amounts of the individual beneficial
interests in such Global Notes to the accounts of persons who have accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream. Such
accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the initial purchasers. Ownership of beneficial interests in
the Global Notes will be limited to participants or persons who hold interests through participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream. Ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of that
ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream or their nominees (with
respect to interests of participants) and the records of participants (with respect to interests of persons other than
participants).

###### As long as the Common Depositary, or its nominee, is the registered holder of a global note, the Common Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner and holder of the notes represented by such global notes for all purposes under the Indenture and the notes. Unless
(1) Euroclear and Clearstream notify Crown European Holdings they are unwilling or unable to continue as clearing
agency, (2) the Common Depositary notifies Crown European Holdings that it is unwilling or unable to continue as
Common Depositary and a successor Common Depositary is not appointed within 120 days of such notice or (3) an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to such note, owners of beneficial interests in such global
note will not be entitled to have any portions of such global note registered in their names, will not receive or be
entitled to receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will not be considered the owners or holders of
such global note (or any notes represented thereby) under the Indenture or the notes. In addition, no beneficial owners
of an interest in a global note will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with Euroclear’s and
Clearstream’s procedures (in addition to those under the Indenture).

Investors may hold their interests in the Global Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are
participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations which are participants in such systems. All interests
in a global note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Payments of the principal of and interest on Global Notes will be made to the Common Depositary or its
nominee as the registered owner thereof. Neither Crown European Holdings, the Trustee, the Common Depositary
nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or
payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the global notes or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.

Crown European Holdings expects that the Common Depositary, in its capacity as paying agent, upon
receipt of any payment of principal or interest in respect of a global note representing any notes held by it or its
nominee, will immediately credit the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream, which in turn will immediately credit
accounts of participants in Euroclear and Clearstream with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective
beneficial interests in the principal amount of such global note for the notes as shown on the records of Euroclear
and Clearstream. Crown European Holdings also expects that payments by participants to owners of beneficial
interests in such global note held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary
practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in “street name.” Such
payments will be the responsibility of such participants.


-----

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of their participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of a holder of a beneficial interest in global Notes to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions
in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for such interest. The laws of some
countries and some U.S. states require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in certificated form.
Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a global note to such persons may be limited. Because
Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, which in turn act on behalf of indirect participants
and certain banks, the ability of a person having a beneficial interest in a global note to pledge such interest to persons
or entities that do not participate in Euroclear and Clearstream, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest,
may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interest.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised Crown European Holdings that they will take any action permitted
to be taken by a holder of notes (including the presentation of notes for exchange as described below) only at the
direction of one or more participants to whose account with Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, interests
in the global notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as
to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an Event of Default
under the notes, Euroclear and Clearstream reserve the right to exchange the global notes for legended notes in
certificated form, and to distribute the notes to their respective participants.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised Crown European Holdings as follows: Euroclear and Clearstream
each hold securities for their account holders and facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions by
electronic book-entry transfer between their respective account holders, thereby eliminating the need for physical
movements of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities.

Euroclear and Clearstream each provide various services, including safekeeping, administration, clearance
and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Euroclear and Clearstream
each also deal with domestic securities markets in several countries through established depository and custodial
relationships. The respective systems of Euroclear and Clearstream have established an electronic bridge between
their two systems across which their respective account holders may settle trades with each other.

Account holders in both Euroclear and Clearstream are worldwide financial institutions including
underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, trust companies and clearing corporations. Indirect access to both
Euroclear and Clearstream is available to other institutions that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship
with an account holder of either system.

An account holder’s overall contractual relations with either Euroclear or Clearstream are governed by the
respective rules and operating procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream and any applicable laws. Both Euroclear and
Clearstream act under such rules and operating procedures only on behalf of their respective account holders, and
have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their respective account holders.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of
interests in global notes among participants of Euroclear and Clearstream, they are under no obligation to do so, and
such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. Neither Crown European Holdings nor the Trustee
will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or
indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Certificated Notes**

If any depositary is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as a depositary for notes for the reasons set
forth above under “—Global Notes,” Crown European Holdings will issue certificates for the notes in definitive, fully
registered, non-global form without interest coupons in exchange for the applicable global notes.


-----

Certificates for notes delivered in exchange for any global note or beneficial interests therein will be
registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by Euroclear, Clearstream or the
Common Depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures).

Certificates for non-global notes issued in exchange for a global note (or any portion thereof) will bear the
applicable restrictive legend referred to under “Notice to Investors” and certificates for non-global notes issued in
exchange for a Regulation S Global Note (or any portion thereof) will bear the Regulation S Legend (in each case
unless Crown European Holdings determines otherwise in accordance with applicable law). The holder of a nonglobal note may transfer such note, subject to compliance with the provisions of the applicable legend, by surrendering
it at the office or agency maintained by Crown European Holdings for such purpose in Dublin, Ireland, which initially
will be the offices of the Transfer Agent in such location. Upon the transfer, exchange or replacement of any note
bearing a legend, or upon specific request for removal of a legend on a note, Crown European Holdings will deliver
only notes that bear such legend, or will refuse to remove such legend, as the case may be, unless there is delivered to
Crown European Holdings such satisfactory evidence, which may include an opinion of counsel, as may reasonably
be required by Crown European Holdings that neither such legend nor any restrictions on transfer set forth therein are
required to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act. Before any note in non-global form may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in any global note, the transferor will be required
to provide the Trustee with such certification as the Trustee may reasonably request. Upon transfer or partial
redemption of any note, new certificates may be obtained from the Transfer Agent.

Notwithstanding any statement herein, Crown European Holdings and the Trustee reserve the right to
impose such transfer, certification, exchange or other requirements, and to require such restrictive legends on
certificates evidencing notes, as they may determine are necessary to ensure compliance with the securities laws of
the United States and any State therein and any other applicable laws or as Euroclear or Clearstream may require.

_Prescription. Under New York’s statute of limitations, any legal action upon the notes must be commenced_
within six years after the payment thereof is due. Thereafter, the notes will become generally unenforceable.

      - a U.S. holder (as defined below) that holds notes through a non-U.S. broker or other non-U.S.
intermediary, or

      - a U.S. holder whose functional currency for tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar.

**YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX**
**CONSEQUENCES TO YOU ARISING FROM YOUR PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF**
**A NOTE, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL ESTATE OR GIFT TAX LAWS,**
**ANY U.S. STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS AND ANY PROPOSED CHANGES IN APPLICABLE**
**TAX LAWS.**

*******************************

This section (i) does not address U.S. federal tax consequences other than income tax consequences, such as
estate and gift tax consequences and alternative minimum tax consequences, (ii) does not deal with all tax
considerations that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s personal circumstances, and (iii) does not
address any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences.


-----

This section is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”),
its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations under the Internal Revenue Code, published rulings and court
decisions, all as currently in effect, all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly on a
retroactive basis. Crown European Holdings is not seeking a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”)
regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the notes. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that the IRS will not successfully challenge one or more of the conclusions stated herein.

If an entity taxable as a partnership holds the notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally
will depend on the status of the particular partner and the activities of the partnership. Partners of partnerships
considering an investment in the notes should consult their tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of
holding the notes indirectly through ownership of their partnership interests.

**Payments Subject to Certain Contingencies**

In certain circumstances, Crown European Holdings may be obligated to pay holders amounts in excess of
the stated interest and principal payable on the notes or in advance of their scheduled payment dates. The obligation
to make such payments may implicate the provisions of U.S. Treasury Regulations relating to “contingent payment
debt instruments.” If the notes were deemed to be contingent payment debt instruments, holders might, among other
things, be required to treat any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of a note as ordinary income rather
than as capital gain, and the timing and amount of income inclusion may be different from the consequences discussed
herein. Crown European Holdings intends to take the position that the likelihood that such payments would be made
is remote and/or that such payments would be incidental in the aggregate, and therefore the notes are not subject to
the rules governing contingent payment debt instruments. This determination will be binding on a holder unless such
holder explicitly discloses on a statement attached to such holder’s timely filed U.S. federal income tax return for the
taxable year that includes the acquisition date of the note that such holder’s determination is different. It is possible,
however, that the IRS may take a contrary position from that described above, in which case the tax consequences to
a holder could differ materially and adversely from those described below. The remainder of this disclosure assumes
that the notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**U.S. Holders**

This subsection describes the tax consequences to a U.S. holder. You are a U.S. holder if you are a beneficial
owner of a note and you are for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

      - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States,

      - a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia,

      - an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source, or

      - a trust if (x) a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or
more United States persons (as defined under the Internal Revenue Code) are authorized to control
all substantial decisions of the trust or (y) it has a valid election in effect under the applicable U.S.
Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person.

**_Taxation of Stated Interest_**

Subject to the discussion below, payments of stated interest on your note generally will be taxable to you, as
ordinary income at the time you receive the interest or when it accrues, depending on your regular method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Interest will be treated as foreign source income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any French taxes
imposed on interest will be eligible for the U.S. foreign tax credit (or deduction in lieu of such credit), subject to
certain limitations. Crown European Holdings does not expect that the interest will be subject to withholding in France.
Please see the discussion below regarding the French tax consequences to U.S. holders under “Material French Tax


-----

Considerations.” The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific
classes of income. For purposes of this calculation, interest on the notes will generally constitute “passive income” or,
in the case of certain U.S. holders, “general category income.”

The amount of interest income (including income attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note) realized by a U.S. holder that uses the cash method of
tax accounting will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment based on the spot exchange rate in effect on the date
of receipt regardless of whether the payment in fact is converted into U.S. dollars. No foreign currency gain or loss
will be recognized with respect to the receipt of such payment (other than foreign currency gain or loss realized on
any subsequent disposition of the foreign currency so received, as described under “— Exchange of Non-U.S.
_Currencies”)._

A U.S. holder using the accrual method of tax accounting will accrue interest income (including income
attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note)
in euros and translate the amount accrued into U.S. dollars based on the average exchange rate in effect during the
interest accrual period (or portion thereof within the U.S. holder’s taxable year) or, at the election of a U.S. holder
using the accrual method of tax accounting, at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt, if such date is within
five business days of the last day of the accrual period, or on the last date of the accrual period (or portion thereof
within the U.S. holder’s taxable year). A U.S. holder that makes such election must apply it consistently to all debt
instruments from year to year and cannot change the election without consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder required to
accrue interest income for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize foreign currency gain or loss, as the case
may be, on the receipt of an interest payment made with respect to a note if the exchange rate in effect on the date the
payment is received differs from the rate applicable to a previous accrual of that interest income, regardless of whether
the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. The foreign currency gain or loss will be treated as U.S. source
ordinary income or loss but generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income received on the note.

**Original Issue Discount**

If the stated principal amount of the notes exceeds their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial
amount of the notes is sold for cash to investors other than to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations
acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) by more than a statutorily defined de minimis
amount, the notes will be treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to such
excess. In such event, a U.S. holder will be required to include such OID in taxable income (as ordinary income) as it
accrues (on a constant yield-to-maturity basis), in advance of the receipt of the cash payments to which such OID is
attributable and regardless of the holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

OID on the notes will be determined for any accrual period in euros and then translated into U.S. dollars. The
U.S. dollar value of accrued OID will be determined by translating such OID in the same manner as described above
under “Taxation of Stated Interest” with respect to stated interest for U.S. holders using the accrual method of tax
accounting. Foreign currency gain or loss with respect to any accruals of OID must be calculated separately from any
foreign currency gain or loss with respect to a sale, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note. Such
foreign currency gain or loss is determined when OID is considered paid (i.e., upon the sale, redemption, retirement
or other taxable disposition of the applicable note), to the extent that the exchange rate on the date of payment differs
from the exchange rate at which the OID was accrued. Any OID will be treated as foreign source income for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

**_Sale, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**

Except as described below, you will generally recognize capital gain or loss on the sale, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of your note equal to the difference between the amount you realize on such
disposition (excluding any amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest and OID, if any, which will be taxed as
ordinary income as discussed above to the extent not previously includible in income) and your adjusted tax basis in
your note. Your adjusted tax basis in your note generally will be the amount that you paid for the note, increased by
any OID you previously included in income in respect of the note. If you purchased a note with euros, your adjusted
tax basis generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the amount you paid for the note at the time of such purchase. If
your note is sold, redeemed, retired or otherwise disposed of for an amount in euros, your amount realized generally


-----

will be the U.S. dollar value of the euros received, based on the spot rate of euros on the date of such sale, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition. However, if the notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash
basis taxpayer will use the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase or sale (instead of the trade date). An accrual
basis U.S. holder (or a U.S. holder subject to the OID rules described herein) may elect to use the settlement date,
provided the election is applied consistently. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Any
such gain or loss generally will be U.S. source gain or loss, and generally will be capital gain or loss, except as
described in the next paragraph. Capital gain of a noncorporate U.S. holder is generally eligible for reduced tax rates
where the property is held for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations under
the Internal Revenue Code.

Gain or loss recognized by you on the sale, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of your note
generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to the extent that the gain or loss is attributable to changes in the
exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro during the period in which you held such note. This currency gain
or loss will generally be determined by reference to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price
on the date the note is disposed of (or, if applicable, deemed disposed of) using the spot rate on such date, and the U.S.
dollar value of such purchase price on the date the note was acquired, determined using the spot rate on the date the
note was acquired.

With respect to the sale, redemption, retirement other taxable disposition of a note, the foreign currency
amount realized will be considered first to be the payment of accrued but unpaid interest and OID, if any, and thereafter
a payment of principal. Exchange gain or loss on principal, or interest, or OID, if any, will be recognized only to the
extent of the total gain or loss realized on the transaction, will be treated as ordinary income or loss, and generally will
be treated as from U.S. sources for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes.

**_Exchange of Non-U.S. Currencies_**

A U.S. holder will have a tax basis in any euros received as interest or upon the sale, redemption, retirement
or other taxable disposition of a note, equal to the U.S. dollar value thereof at the time the interest is received or, in
the case of a payment received in consideration of the sale, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition, on the
date used to compute exchange gain or loss with respect to such disposition. Any gain or loss realized by a U.S. holder
on a sale, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of euros, including their exchange for U.S. dollars or
their use to purchase notes, will generally be considered ordinary income or loss from U.S. sources.

**_Additional Tax on Net Investment Income_**

Certain non-corporate U.S. holders are subject to a 3.8% tax, in addition to regular tax on income and gains,
on some or all of their “net investment income,” which generally will include interest on a note, any exchange gain
and any net gain recognized upon a disposition of a note. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the
applicability of this tax in respect of their notes.

**Non-U.S. Holders**

You are a non-U.S. holder if you are a beneficial owner of a note that is an individual, corporation, trust or
estate for U.S. federal income tax purposes and you are not a U.S. holder.

If you are a non-U.S. holder, except as provided by an applicable income tax treaty, you generally will not
be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax on interest (which for purposes of this discussion of non-U.S.
holders includes any OID) or gain realized on the sale, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note
unless:

      - such interest or gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United
States, or

      - in the case of gain, you are an individual, you are present in the United States for 183 or more days
during the taxable year in which the gain is realized and certain other conditions exist, in which case


-----

you will be subject to a flat 30% U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized which may be
offset by certain U.S. losses.

If interest or gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States, you
generally will be taxed in the same manner as a U.S. holder with respect to such interest or gain, except to the extent
otherwise provided under an applicable income tax treaty. In addition, if you are a non-U.S. corporation, you may also
be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable income tax treaty rate) of your effectively
connected earnings and profits attributable to such interest or gain.

**FATCA Withholding on Payments to Certain Foreign Entities**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Internal Revenue Code (provisions commonly referred to as “FATCA”)
generally impose withholding of 30% on payments of U.S. source interest to certain foreign entities (including
financial intermediaries, and whether as the beneficial owner of as an intermediary for the beneficial owner), unless
various U.S. information reporting, diligence requirements (that are in addition to, and potentially significantly more
onerous than, the requirement to deliver an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E) and certain other
requirements have been satisfied. Such payments generally include payments of interest made on certain debt
instruments.

FATCA generally applies to debt instruments issued by U.S. issuers, but may also apply to debt instruments
issued by certain non-U.S. issuers. Under Treasury Regulations and published administrative guidance, a
grandfathering rule provides that a debt instrument of a non-U.S. issuer issued on or before the date that is 6 months
after the final U.S. Treasury Regulations regarding non-U.S. issuers are adopted would generally not be subject to
FATCA withholding unless there is a significant modification of the debt instruments after such date, but if there is
such a significant modification after such dates, the debt instruments become subject to FATCA. Such Treasury
Regulations have not been issued as of the date hereof. If FATCA withholding is imposed, Additional Amounts would
not be payable in respect thereof and, as a result, payments made hereunder would be reduced by the amount of such
withholding. You should consult your tax advisors regarding FATCA and how it may affect your investment in the
notes.

**Backup Withholding and Information Reporting**

**_U.S. Holders_**

Information reporting on IRS Form 1099 will apply to payments of interest (or accruals of OID, if any) on,
or the proceeds of the sale, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes with respect to certain noncorporate U.S. holders, and backup withholding may apply unless the recipient of such payments has supplied a
taxpayer identification number, certified under penalties of perjury, as well as certain other information or otherwise
established an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts
withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against that holder’s U.S. federal
income tax liability provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Certain U.S. holders may be required to report information with respect to an investment in the notes not held
through an account with a financial institution to the IRS. Investors who fail to report required information could
become subject to substantial penalties. Prospective investors are urged to consult with their tax advisors regarding
these information reporting requirements.

Certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including, in certain circumstances, a sale,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a debt instrument or foreign currency received in respect of a
debt instrument to the extent such disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. Investors who fail
to report requested information could become subject to substantial penalties. Prospective investors should consult
their tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the notes, including
any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).


-----

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

Backup withholding and information reporting on IRS Form 1099 will not apply to payments of interest (and
the accrual of OID, if any) to a non-U.S. holder provided that the non-U.S. holder is the beneficial owner of the notes
and certifies to the applicable withholding agent, under penalties of perjury, that it is not a United States person and
provides its name and address on a duly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, (or a
suitable substitute form).

Information reporting and backup withholding generally will not apply to a payment of the proceeds of a
sale, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of notes effected outside the United States by a non-U.S.
office of a non-U.S. broker. However, information reporting requirements (but not backup withholding) will apply to
a payment of the proceeds of a sale, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of notes effected outside the
United States by a non-U.S. office of a broker if the broker (i) is a United States person, (ii) derives 50 percent or
more of its gross income for certain periods from the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, (iii) is a
“controlled foreign corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or (iv) is a non-U.S. partnership that, at any
time during its taxable year is 50 percent or more (by income or capital interest) owned by United States persons or is
engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, unless in any such case the broker has documentary
evidence in its records that the holder is a non-U.S. holder and certain conditions are met, or the holder otherwise
establishes an exemption. Payment of the proceeds of a sale, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of
notes by a U.S. office of a broker will be subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the
holder certifies its non-U.S. status under penalties of perjury or otherwise establishes an exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may
be allowed as a refund or a credit against that holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**MATERIAL FRENCH TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**General**

The following is a summary of certain French tax considerations relating to the holding of the notes. The
following description is only addressed to potential purchasers of notes who (i) are not French residents for tax
purposes, (ii) do not hold the notes in connection with a permanent establishment or a fixed base in France and (iii)
do not currently hold, directly or indirectly, shares of the issuer (such holders being hereafter referred to as a “NonFrench Holders”).

The description below only represents a summary of material provisions of French tax laws and regulations
as currently in effect and applied by the French tax authorities, all of which are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect, or to different interpretations which may change the tax treatment applicable to the notes. The
following description is for general information only and, due to its summary character, does not cover all details and
tax exemptions which may apply in specific individual cases and may even require a deviation therefrom, including
as a result of the application of the provisions of any relevant tax treaty. It is not intended to be, nor should it be
construed to be, legal or tax advice. Therefore, prospective investors are advised to consult their own advisors as to
which countries’ tax laws could be relevant to acquiring, holding and disposing of the notes and the consequences of
such actions under the tax laws of those countries.

Furthermore, it does not deal with any tax aspects other than the withholding and income taxes and stamp
duty described below.

Prospective investors in the notes are urged to consult their own professional tax advisers as to French tax
consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of the notes in light of their particular circumstances.

_Withholding Tax_

Pursuant to Article 125 A III of the French General Tax Code, payments of interest and other assimilated
revenues made by the issuer with respect to the notes will not be subject to withholding tax unless such payments are
made outside of France in a non-cooperative State or territory (État ou territoire non coopératif) within the meaning
of Article 238-0 A of the French General Tax Code (the “Non-Cooperative State”) other than those states or territories
mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the same Article 238-0 A, in which case, a 75% withholding tax will be applicable (subject
to exceptions, certain of which are set forth below, and to the more favorable provisions of any applicable double tax
treaty). The 75% withholding tax is applicable irrespective of the tax residence of the holder of the notes. The list of
Non-Cooperative States is published by a ministerial executive order, which is updated on a yearly basis and which
should include, under certain conditions, states and jurisdictions also included into the EU list of non-cooperative
jurisdictions for tax purposes (so called “Black List”), published and updated at the level of the EU by the Council of
the European Union.

Furthermore, in application of Article 238 A of the French General Tax Code, interest and other assimilated
revenues on the notes will not be deductible from the issuer’s taxable income, if:

    - such interest or revenues are paid or accrued to persons established or domiciled either (i) in a foreign
State or territory where these persons (x) are not taxable or (y) are subject to income taxes which amount
represents 40% or less of the amount of income taxes which they would have been liable to if they had
been established in France (the “Privileged Tax Status Deductibility Exclusion”), or (ii) in a NonCooperative State (the “Non-Cooperative State Deductibility Exclusion”); or

    - such interest or revenues are paid to a bank account opened in a financial institution located in such a
foreign State or territory mentioned under (i) above, or in a Non-Cooperative State (together with the
Privileged Tax Status Deductibility Exclusion and the Non-Cooperative State Deductibility Exclusion
the “Deductibility Exclusions”).

Under certain conditions, any such non-deductible interest and other revenues may be recharacterised as
deemed dividends pursuant to Articles 109 and _seq. of the French General Tax Code,_ in which case such non

-----

deductible interest and other revenues may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Articles 119 bis 2 of the
French General Tax Code. According to Article 187 of the French General Tax Code, the withholding tax rate is set
at 12.8% if the Non-French Holders are individuals, at 25% if the Non-French Holders are corporate bodies or entities
of any other form and at 75%, irrespective of the tax residence of the Non-French Holders, if the payment of such
deemed dividends is made outside of France in a Non-Cooperative State other than those states or territories mentioned
in 2° of 2 bis of Article 238-0 A of the French General Tax Code (subject, if applicable, to the more favorable
provisions of any applicable double tax treaty).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the law provides that (i) the 75% withholding tax set out under Article 125
A III of the French General Tax Code, (ii) the Deductibility Exclusions, and (iii) the 75% withholding tax set out
under Articles 119 bis 2 and 187 of the French General Tax Code that may be levied as a result of the Deductibility
Exclusions, will not apply in respect of the notes if the issuer can prove that (i) the principal purpose and effect of the
issue of the notes were not that of allowing the payments of interest or other revenues to be made in a Non-Cooperative
State (the “Exception”) and (ii) in respect of the Deductibility Exclusions, that the relevant interest and other revenues
relate to genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount. Pursuant to the Bulletin Officiel des
_Finances Publiques-Impôts BOI-INT-DG-20-50-30 no. 150 (published on 14 June 2022) and BOI-INT-DG-20-50-20_
no. 290 (published on 6 June 2023), BOI-RPPM-RCM-30-10-20-40 (published on 20 December 2019), BOI-IRDOMIC-10-20-20-60 no. 10 (published on 20 December 2019), the notes will benefit from the Exception without the
issuer having to provide any proof of the purpose and effect of the issue of the notes, if the notes are:

(i) offered by means of a public offer within the meaning of Article L. 411-1 of the French Monetary
and Financial Code and not exempted from the obligation to publish a prospectus under the
Prospectus Regulation or pursuant to an equivalent offer in a State other than a Non-Cooperative
State. For this purpose, an “equivalent offer” means any offer requiring the registration or
submission of an offer document by or with a foreign securities market authority; or

(ii) admitted to trading on a French or foreign regulated market or multilateral securities trading system
provided that such market or system is not located in a Non-Cooperative State, and the operation of
such market is carried out by a market operator or an investment services provider, or by such other
similar foreign entity, provided further that such market operator, investment services provider or
entity is not located in a Non-Cooperative State; or

(iii) admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of a central depositary or of a securities clearing
and delivery and payments systems operator within the meaning of Article L.561-2 of the French
Monetary and Financial Code, or of one or more similar foreign depositaries or operators provided
that such depositary or operator is not located in a Non-Cooperative State.

Assuming, inter alia, that the notes are admitted at the time of their issue to the clearing operations of a
central depositary or of a securities clearing and delivery and payments systems operator within the meaning of Article
L. 561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code which is not located in a Non-Cooperative State, and that the
issuer can demonstrate that the relevant interest and other revenues relate to genuine transactions and are not in an
abnormal or exaggerated amount, payments of interest to Non-French Holders of the notes should neither be subject
to the withholding tax set out under article 125 A III of the French General Tax Code nor to the withholding tax set
out in article 119 bis 2 of the French General Tax Code that may be levied as a result of the Deductibility Exclusions.

_Sale or Other Disposition of the Notes_

A Non-French Holder will generally not be subject to income or withholding taxes in France with respect to
gains realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the notes.

_Stamp Duty and Similar Taxes_

No transfer taxes or similar duties are payable in France in connection with the issuance or redemption of the
notes, as well as in connection with the sale of the notes and the payment of interest on the notes, other than the
possible application of a fixed registration duty (droit fixe).

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

None of the notes have been registered under the Securities Act and they may not be offered or sold within
the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the notes are being offered
and sold only (A) to persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A
promulgated under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”)) (“QIBs”) in compliance with Rule 144A, or (B) outside the
United States to persons other than U.S. persons (“non-U.S. purchasers”, which term shall include dealers or other
professional fiduciaries in the United States acting on a discretionary basis for non-U.S. beneficial owners (other than
an estate or trust)) in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”). As used herein, the terms
“United States” and “U.S. person” have the meanings given to them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of notes will be deemed to have represented and agreed as follows:

1. It is purchasing the notes for its own account or an account with respect to which it exercises sole
investment discretion and that it and any such account is either (A) a QIB, and is aware that the sale to it is being made
in reliance on Rule 144A, or (B) a non-U.S. purchaser that is outside the United States (or a non-U.S. purchaser that
is a dealer or other fiduciary as referred to above).

2. It acknowledges that the notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be
offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except as set forth below.

3. It shall not, on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor for which it has purchased notes, prior
to the date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) that is one year (in the case of notes issued in reliance on Rule
144A (“Rule 144A notes”)) or 40 days (in the case of notes issued in reliance on Regulation S (“Regulation S notes”))
(or such shorter period of time as permitted by Rule 144A or Regulation S, as applicable, under the Securities Act or
any successor provision thereunder) after the later of the original issue date of the notes and the last date on which the
issuer or any affiliate of the issuer were the owner of such notes (or any predecessor of such notes) or, if later, the last
date upon which Additional Notes (as defined in the Indenture) have been issued, offer, resell or otherwise transfer
any of such notes except (A) to the issuer or any of their subsidiaries, (B) inside the United States to a QIB in a
transaction complying with Rule 144A, (C) inside the United States to institutional “accredited investors” (as defined
in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities Act) (an “Accredited Investor”), that, prior to such transfer,
furnishes (or has furnished on its behalf by a U.S. broker-dealer) to the Trustee a signed letter containing certain
representations and agreements relating to the restrictions on transfer of the notes (the form of which letter can be
obtained from such Trustee), (D) outside the United States in compliance with Rule 904 under the Securities Act, (E)
pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act (if available), (F) in
accordance with another exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act (and based upon an
opinion of counsel if the issuer so requests), or (G) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities
Act.

4. It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the notes notice of any restrictions on
transfer of such notes.

5. It acknowledges that prior to any proposed transfer of notes in certificated form or of beneficial
interests in a note in global form (a “Global Note”) (in each case other than pursuant to an effective registration
statement) the holder of notes or the holder of beneficial interests in a Global Note, as the case may be, may be required
to provide certifications and other documentation relating to the manner of such transfer and submit such certifications
and other documentation as provided in the Indenture.

6. It understands that all of the notes will bear a legend substantially to the following effect unless
otherwise agreed by the issuer and the holder thereof:

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors**

Each initial purchaser has represented and agreed in the purchase agreement that it has not offered, sold or
otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise made available any notes which are the subject of the
offering contemplated by this offering memorandum to any retail investor in the EEA. For the purposes of this
provision:

(a) the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

(i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

(ii) a customer within the meaning of the IDD, where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

(iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in point (e) of Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation; and

(b) the expression “offer” includes the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information
on the terms of the offer and the notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or
subscribe for the notes.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any Member State of
the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus
Regulation.

**Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors**

Each initial purchaser has represented and agreed in the purchase agreement that it has not offered, sold or
otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any notes to any retail investor in the
United Kingdom. For the purposes of this provision:

(b) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in the UK will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation and the FSMA from the requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the UK Prospectus
Regulation or the FSMA.

**Notice to Canadian Investors**

This offering memorandum does not address any Canadian federal, provincial or territorial income tax
considerations applicable to purchasers and beneficial owners of notes who are resident in Canada for Canadian
income tax purposes. There may be material Canadian federal, provincial or territorial income tax considerations
applicable to such purchasers and beneficial owners of notes. Such purchasers and beneficial owners should consult
their own tax advisors in this regard.

The notes may be sold in Canada only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal
that are accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1)
of the Securities Act (Ontario), and that are permitted clients, as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration
_Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the notes must be made in accordance_
with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian
securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for
rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a misrepresentation,
provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed
by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable
provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult
with a legal advisor.

Pursuant to section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 _Underwriting Conflicts_ (NI 33-105), the initial
purchasers are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding initial purchaser
conflicts of interest in connection with this offering memorandum.

**New Issue of Notes**

The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to apply for
listing of the notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes on any automated dealer quotation
system. Prior to the offering, there has been no active market for the notes. Crown European Holdings intends to
submit an application to list the notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to trade on the Euro
MTF; however, even if such application is made and approved, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or
trading market for, the notes. Certain of the initial purchasers have advised the issuer that they presently intend to
make a market in the notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. The initial purchasers are not obligated,
however, to make a market in the notes and any such market making may be discontinued at any time at the sole
discretion of the initial purchasers. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets
for, the notes.

**Stabilization and Short Positions**

In connection with the offering, certain persons participating in the offering may engage in transactions that
stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the notes. Specifically, the initial purchasers may bid for and
purchase notes in the open markets to stabilize the price of the notes. The initial purchasers may also overallot the
offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase notes in the open market to cover the


-----

syndicate short position. In addition, the initial purchasers may bid for and purchase notes in market making
transactions and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the
notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The initial purchasers are not required to engage in these
activities, and may end these activities at any time. We and the initial purchasers make no representation as to the
direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. In
addition, neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation that anyone will engage in such
transactions or that such transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

**Other Relationships**

The initial purchasers and certain of their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the
initial purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in the
future investment banking, commercial lending and financial advisory services to the issuer and its affiliates in the
ordinary course of business for which they have received, or may in the future receive, compensation. In addition,
certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates are lenders and/or agents under Crown’s senior secured credit
facilities and receive compensation thereunder. Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates may hold a portion
of the 2024 Notes, and as such, may receive a portion of the proceeds from this offering. See “Use of Proceeds”.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers and their affiliates may
make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities)
and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such
investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. If any of the
initial purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us, certain of those initial purchasers or their
affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit
exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, these initial purchasers and their
affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default
swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such
credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The
initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express
independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to
clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

**Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about      , 2024, which
will be the     business day following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement being referred to as T
). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in one business
day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes
prior to the date that is one business day preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the
notes initially settle in T+  , to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent
a failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes prior to the date that is one business day
preceding the settlement date should consult their advisors.
