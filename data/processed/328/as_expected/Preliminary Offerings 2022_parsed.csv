328,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,3080,SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,3080.1,,3080.1.1,,"This offering memorandum makes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, namely EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA of Crown. These non-GAAP measures are not recognized measures under U.S. GAAP, do not have a standard meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement U.S. GAAP measures by providing further understanding of Crown’s results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under U.S. GAAP. Crown calculates EBITDA as net income plus the sum of income taxes, interest expense (net of interest income) and depreciation and amortization. Crown calculates Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus the sum of restructuring and other, including asset impairments and provision for asbestos, loss from early extinguishments of debt, other pension and postretirement, foreign exchange, equity earnings and discontinued operations. For a reconciliation of EBITDA to net income, and of Adjusted EBITDA to EBITDA, see “Summary— Summary Historical Financial Data.” ----- We have included EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to provide investors with a supplemental measure of our performance. We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are important supplemental measures of performance because they eliminate items that may have less bearing on our performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP financial measures. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use EBITDA in the evaluation of issuer, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results. Our management also uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in order to facilitate performance comparisons from period to period, prepare annual operating budgets and assess our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditure and working capital requirements. A limitation associated with EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the business. Any measure that eliminates components of the capital structure and costs associated with carrying significant amounts of assets on its balance sheet has material limitations as a performance measure. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures such as capital expenditures. In addition, in evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that the adjustments may vary from period to period and in the future Crown will incur expenses such as those used in calculating these measures. Furthermore, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by Crown within this document, may not be comparable to calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies. In light of the foregoing limitations, Crown does not rely solely on EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as performance measures and also considers its results as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For purposes of the covenants in the indenture governing the notes, EBITDA is defined differently, and for purposes of our credit facility and for reviewing goodwill for impairment, Adjusted EBITDA is defined differently. This offering memorandum also makes reference to segment income and free cash flow, which are not defined terms under U.S. GAAP. In addition, the information presented in this offering memorandum excluding the impact of currency translation, and regarding net income before certain items does not conform to U.S. GAAP and includes non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies. We view segment income as the principal measure of performance of our operations and free cash flow as the principal measure of our liquidity. We consider both of these measures in the allocation of resources. Free cash flow has certain limitations, however, including that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt service requirements, are not deducted from the measure. The amount of non-discretionary versus discretionary expenditures can vary significantly between periods. We believe that net income before certain items is useful in evaluating Crown’s operations as this measure is adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods. -----",,as_expected,2022,80,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: This offering memorandum makes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, namely EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA of Crown.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA information is unaudited and has been included in this offering memorandum because Crown believes that certain analysts, rating agencies and investors may use it as supplemental information to evaluate a company’s ability to service its indebtedness and overall performance over time. However, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have material limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of Crown’s results as reported under U.S. GAAP. A limitation associated with EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in Crown’s business. Any measure that eliminates components of Crown’s capital structure and costs associated with carrying significant amounts of assets on its balance sheet has material limitations as a performance measure. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets through other financial measures such as capital expenditures. In addition, in evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that the adjustments may vary from period to period and in the future Crown will incur expenses such as those used in calculating these measures. Furthermore, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by Crown, may not be comparable to calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies. In light of the foregoing limitations, Crown does not rely solely on EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as performance measures and also considers its results as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

As of December 31, 2021, Crown and its subsidiaries had approximately $6.3 billion of indebtedness, excluding unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, including approximately $1.4 billion of secured indebtedness and $3.2 billion of additional indebtedness of non-guarantor subsidiaries and the ability to borrow $1.5 billion under Crown’s senior secured revolving credit facilities. The substantial indebtedness of Crown could: - make it more difficult for Crown and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations with respect to the notes, such as the issuer’s obligation to purchase notes tendered as a result of a change in control of Crown; - increase Crown’s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including rising interest rates; - restrict Crown from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities, including any planned expansion in emerging markets; - limit Crown’s ability to make capital expenditures both domestically and internationally in order to grow Crown’s business or maintain manufacturing plants in good working order and repair; - limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants under Crown’s indebtedness, Crown’s ability to obtain additional financing, dispose of assets or pay cash dividends; - require Crown to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements; - require Crown to sell assets used in its business; - limit Crown’s ability to refinance its existing indebtedness, particularly during periods of adverse credit market conditions when refinancing indebtedness may not be available under interest rates and other terms acceptable to Crown or at all; - increase Crown’s cost of borrowing; - limit Crown’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which it operates; and - place Crown at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt. ----- If its financial condition, operating results and liquidity deteriorate, Crown’s creditors may restrict its ability to obtain future financing and its suppliers could require prepayment or cash on delivery rather than extend credit which could further diminish Crown’s ability to generate cash flows from operations sufficient to service its debt obligations.

Such secured indebtedness may increase if Crown incurs secured indebtedness, including under Crown’s senior secured revolving credit facilities, to finance an acquisition, fund dividends or the repurchase of Crown common stock or otherwise. Because of the liens on the assets securing the senior secured credit facilities, in the event of the bankruptcy, wind-up, reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of the borrowers or any guarantor of such indebtedness, the assets of the borrowers or guarantors would be available to pay obligations under the notes offered hereby and other unsecured obligations only after payments had been made on the borrowers’ or the guarantors’ secured indebtedness.

Although Crown’s senior secured credit facilities and indentures governing its outstanding notes contain restrictions on Crown’s ability to incur indebtedness, those restrictions are subject to a number of exceptions, and, under certain circumstances, indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Crown may also consider investments in joint ventures or acquisitions or increased capital expenditures, which may increase Crown’s indebtedness. Moreover, although Crown’s senior secured credit facilities and indentures governing certain of its outstanding notes contain restrictions on Crown’s ability to make restricted payments, including the declaration and payment of dividends and the repurchase of Crown’s common stock, Crown is able to make such restricted payments under certain circumstances which may increase indebtedness. In December 2021, Crown's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an aggregate amount of $3 billion of Crown common stock through the end of 2024 and Crown currently pays a quarterly cash dividend of 22 cents per share to its shareholders.

These restrictions may limit Crown’s ability to operate its businesses and may prohibit or limit its ability to enhance its operations or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. Crown’s senior secured credit facilities require Crown to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial conditions. The agreements or indentures governing Crown’s senior secured credit facilities and certain of its outstanding notes restrict, among other things, the ability of Crown and the ability of all or substantially all of its subsidiaries to: - incur additional debt; - pay dividends or make other distributions, repurchase capital stock, repurchase subordinated debt and make certain investments or loans; ----- - create liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions; - create restrictions on the payment of dividends and other amounts to Crown from subsidiaries; - make loans, investments and capital expenditures; - change accounting treatment and reporting practices; - enter into agreements restricting the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends to, make or repay loans to, transfer property to, or guarantee indebtedness of, Crown or any of its subsidiaries; - sell or acquire assets, enter into leaseback transactions and merge or consolidate with or into other companies; and - engage in transactions with affiliates. In addition, the indentures and the agreements governing Crown’s senior secured credit facilities and certain of its outstanding notes limit, among other things, the ability of Crown to enter into certain transactions, such as mergers, consolidations, joint ventures, asset sales, sale and leaseback transactions and the pledging of assets. Furthermore, if Crown or certain of its subsidiaries experience specific kinds of changes of control, Crown’s senior secured credit facilities will be due and payable and Crown will be required to offer to repurchase outstanding notes. The breach of any of these covenants by Crown or the failure by Crown to meet any of these ratios or conditions could result in a default under any or all of such indebtedness. If a default occurs under any such indebtedness, all of the outstanding obligations thereunder could become immediately due and payable, which could result in a default under Crown’s other outstanding debt and could lead to an acceleration of obligations related to the notes and other outstanding debt.

If Crown or Crown Americas experiences a change of control repurchase event, the issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes. However, Crown’s senior secured credit facilities provide that certain change of control events constitute an event of default under the senior secured credit facilities. Such an event of default entitles the lenders thereunder to, among other things, cause all outstanding debt obligations under the senior secured credit facilities to become due and payable and to proceed against the collateral securing the senior secured credit facilities. Any event of default or acceleration of the senior secured credit facilities will likely also cause a default under the terms of other indebtedness of Crown. In addition, Crown’s senior secured credit facilities contain, and any future credit facilities or other agreements to which Crown becomes a party may contain, restrictions on its ability to offer to repurchase the notes in connection with a change of control. In the event a change of control repurchase event occurs at a time when it is prohibited from offering to purchase the notes, the issuer could seek consent to offer to purchase the notes or attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such a prohibition. If it does not obtain the consent or refinance the borrowings, the issuer would remain prohibited from offering to purchase the notes. In such case, the failure by the issuer to offer to purchase the notes would constitute a default under the indenture governing the notes, which, in turn, could result in amounts outstanding under any future credit facility or other agreement relating to indebtedness being declared due and payable. Any such declaration could have adverse consequences to Crown, the issuer and the holders of the notes.",,as_expected,2022,80,

The definition of change of control includes a phrase relating to the transfer of “all or substantially all” of the assets of Crown and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, your ability to require the issuer to repurchase notes as a result of a transfer of less than all of the assets of Crown to another person may be uncertain. In addition, in a 2009 decision, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware raised the possibility that a change of control put right occurring as a result of a failure to have “continuing directors” comprising a majority of a board of directors might be unenforceable on public policy grounds.",,as_expected,2022,80,

Crown is closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on all aspects of its business and geographies, including how it has impacted and will impact Crown’s employees, customers, suppliers and distribution channels. The pandemic, as well as the quarantines and other governmental and non-governmental restrictions which have been imposed throughout the world in an effort to contain, mitigate, or vaccinate against it and the controversies prompted by such restrictions in some regions, has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption which is expected to adversely affect Crown’s business operations and may materially and adversely affect Crown’s results of operations, cash flows and financial position or Crown’s ability to execute its short- and long-term business strategies and initiatives. For example, governmental authorities in several regions (including Pennsylvania, where Crown’s world headquarters are located) have ordered the cessation of all business activity which is deemed non-essential and there is a risk that these shutdown orders will be extended or expanded or that similar shutdown orders will be implemented in other regions (particularly in response to newer variant ----- strains of COVID-19, such as Delta or Omicron); while many beverage and food products are deemed essential, several jurisdictions have implemented restrictions or prohibitions on the sale of alcoholic beverages which have reduced the demand for some of Crown’s products. Likewise, Transit Packaging supplies a wide array of industrial markets which are being negatively affected by a decline in global economic activity. The magnitude of COVID-19’s ultimate impact on Crown (and therefore on the value of the notes) will depend on numerous evolving factors, future developments and cascading effects of the coronavirus pandemic that Crown is not able to predict, including: the severity of the outbreak and the international actions that are being taken to contain and treat it; the duration of the outbreak and the myriad of business restrictions being imposed as a result of it; governmental, business and other responses to the outbreak (including limitations on Crown’s operations and/or mandates that Crown provide products or services); the extent and duration of the effect of the outbreak on consumer confidence and spending, customer demand and buying patterns; the promotion of “social distancing” and the adoption of shelter-in-place orders, vaccine mandates and restrictions on exports affecting customers’ demand for Crown’s products; the extent to which forced remote working arrangements reduce Crown’s ability to effectively manage its global operations; the impact of the outbreak on Crown’s supply chain (including reductions in supply that may result in an inability to meet customer demand); the impact of the outbreak on internal controls (including those over financial reporting); the speed and success of vaccination efforts; any impairment in value of Crown’s tangible or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of a weaker economic conditions; and the effect of the ongoing disruption in the capital markets on Crown’s ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet its liquidity needs. Moreover, employee absenteeism due to members of Crown’s workforce being quarantined or exposed to COVID-19 may impact Crown’s ability to meet staffing needs which, compounded with the effects of ongoing office and potential factory closures, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, border closures, and other travel or health-related restrictions, may in turn impair Crown in the manufacture, distribution and sale of its products (and, as a result, adversely impact the value of the notes). In addition, while Crown cannot predict the magnitude of the impact that COVID-19 will have on its customers and suppliers or their financial conditions, any material effect on Crown’s customers or suppliers could adversely impact Crown. For example, certain of Crown’s suppliers have informed Crown that the coronavirus outbreak and the resulting business restrictions may constrain supply of necessary materials and Crown may face difficulty collecting accounts receivable from any of its customers that may be negatively impacted by the pandemic. The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risk factors discussed in Item 1A of Crown’s Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 (which is incorporated by reference herein), any of which could have a material effect on Crown and therefore on the value of the notes. For example, significant volatility in the equity markets could have a negative impact on the market value of Crown’s pension plan assets which may substantially increase Crown’s future pension plan funding requirements and could have a negative impact on Crown’s results of operations, pension plan funded status and future cash flows. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on Crown’s business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as information is rapidly evolving with respect to the duration and severity of the pandemic.

Crown’s business, financial condition and results of operations, and as a result the value of the notes, may be materially adversely affected by any negative impact on the global economy and capital markets resulting from the conflict in Ukraine or any other geopolitical tensions.","U.S. and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions and the start of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable, the conflict in Ukraine could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain disruptions. Crown is continuing to monitor the situation in Ukraine and globally and assessing its potential impact on Crown’s businesses. ----- Additionally, the conflict in Ukraine has led to sanctions and other penalties being levied by the United States, European Union and other governmental authorities against Russia and Belarus, among others, including agreement to remove certain Russian financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication payment system. Additional potential sanctions and penalties have also been proposed and/or threatened. Russian military actions and the resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets, potentially making it more difficult for Crown to obtain additional funds. Any of the abovementioned factors could affect Crown’s businesses, prospects, financial condition, and operating results, and therefore the value of the notes. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be substantial. Any such disruptions may also magnify the impact of other risks described in Crown’s Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 (which is incorporated by reference herein). -----",,as_expected,2022,80,

Such obligation will not continue after a discharge of the Issuer or defeasance from their obligations with respect to the Notes. See “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance.” On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof (in minimum amounts of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered; and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee all Notes so accepted together with an officers’ certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes (or portions thereof) being purchased by the Issuer.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations under this covenant by virtue thereof. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the Holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction with respect to Parent or an Issuer. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture with respect to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of ----- Control Repurchase Event, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control Repurchase Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control Repurchase Event at the time the Change of Control Offer is made and such Change of Control Offer is otherwise made in compliance with the provisions of this covenant. The Existing Credit Facility and other existing Indebtedness of Parent and its Subsidiaries contain, and their future Indebtedness may contain, prohibitions on the occurrence of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control Repurchase Event or require the repayment or repurchase of such Indebtedness upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under the Existing Credit Facility and/or such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control Repurchase Event itself does not. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Repurchase Event may be limited by their then-existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases and there can be no assurance that the Issuer would be able to obtain financing to make such repurchases. The Issuer’s failure to purchase the Notes in connection with a Change of Control Repurchase Event would result in a Default under the Indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default under such other Indebtedness. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event may deter a third party from acquiring Parent or the Issuer in a transaction that constitutes a Change of Control Repurchase Event. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the transfer of “all or substantially all” of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a Holder of Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its Notes as a result of a transfer of less than all of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person may be uncertain.",,as_expected,2022,80,

328,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,15,CAPITALIZATION,15.27,Certain Bankruptcy and Fraudulent Transfer Limitations,15.27.1,,"Fraudulent transfer, insolvency and administrative laws may void, subordinate or limit the Notes and Note Guarantees and may otherwise limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Under U.S. federal bankruptcy laws or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, the issuance of the Guarantees by Parent and the Guarantors could be voided, or claims in respect of such obligations could be subordinated to all of their other debts and other liabilities, if, among other things, at the time Parent and/or the Guarantors issued the related Guarantees, Parent or the applicable Guarantor intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor; or received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of such indebtedness and either: - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence; - was engaged in a business or transaction for which Parent’s or such Guarantor’s remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. - The measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the ----- law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, Parent or a Guarantor would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of all of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liabilities on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. By its terms, the Guarantee of each Guarantor will limit the liability of each such Guarantor to the maximum amount it can pay without the Guarantee being deemed a fraudulent transfer. Parent believes that immediately after the issuance of the Notes by the Issuer and the issuance of the Guarantees by the Guarantors, Parent and each of the Guarantors will be solvent, will have sufficient capital to carry on its respective business and will be able to pay its respective debts as they mature. However, a court may not apply these standards in making its determinations and a court may not reach the same conclusions with regard to these issues. In an evidentiary ruling in In re W.R. Grace & Co., the federal bankruptcy court for the District of Delaware held that under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, whether a transferor is insolvent or is rendered insolvent depends on the actual liabilities of the transferor, and not what the transferor knows about such liabilities at the time of the transfer. Therefore, under that court’s analysis, liabilities that are unknown, or that are known to exist but whose magnitude is not fully appreciated at the time of the transfer, may be taken into account in the context of a future determination of insolvency. If the principle articulated by that court is upheld, it would make it very difficult to know whether a transferor is solvent at the time of transfer, and would increase the risk that a transfer may in the future be found to be a fraudulent conveyance. If a bankruptcy proceeding were to be commenced under the federal bankruptcy laws by or against Parent or any other Guarantor, it is likely that delays will occur in any payment upon acceleration of the Notes and in enforcing remedies under the applicable Indenture, because of specific provisions of such laws or by a court applying general principles of equity. Provisions under federal bankruptcy laws or general principles of equity that could result in the impairment of your rights include, but are not limited to: - the automatic stay; - avoidance of preferential transfers by a trustee or debtor-in-possession; - substantive consolidation; - limitations on collectibility of unmatured interest or attorney fees; - fraudulent conveyance; and - forced restructuring of the Notes, including reduction of principal amounts and interest rates and extension of maturity dates, over the holders’ objections.",,as_expected,2022,80,

Such accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the initial purchasers and ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be limited to persons who have accounts with DTC (“participants”) or persons who hold interests through participants. Holders may hold their interests in the Global Notes directly through DTC if they are participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations which are participants in such system. So long as DTC, or its nominee, is the registered owner or holder of the Notes, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the Notes represented by such Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. No beneficial owner of an interest in the Global Notes will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with DTC’s procedures, in addition to those provided for under the Indenture with respect to the Notes. Payments of the principal of, premium (if any), interest (including Additional Interest (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement)) on, the Global Notes will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any Paying Agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interest.

The Issuer also expects that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practice, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such payments will be the responsibility of such participants. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way through DTC’s same-day funds system in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same day funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of a Certificated Security for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states which require physical delivery of the Notes, or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in a Global Note, in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. DTC has advised the Issuer that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the DTC interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Indenture, DTC will exchange the Global Notes for Certificated Securities, which it will distribute to its participants and which will include the legend as set forth under the heading “Notice to Investors.” DTC has advised the Issuer as follows: DTC is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “Clearing Agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Indirect access to the DTC system is available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly (“indirect participants”). Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Note among participants of DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",,as_expected,2022,80,

Pursuant to the registration rights agreements, the issuer and the guarantors will agree, at their cost, for the benefit of the holders of the notes, to: - use their reasonable best efforts to file a registration statement with the SEC and cause to become effective the registration statement with respect to a registered offer to exchange the notes for new notes of the issuer having terms substantially identical in all material respects to the notes (except that the exchange notes will not contain terms with respect to transfer restrictions); and - use their reasonable best efforts to cause the registered exchange offer to become completed under the Securities Act within 360 days of the issue date of the notes. Upon the effectiveness of the exchange offer registration statement, the issuer and the guarantors will offer the exchange notes in exchange for the surrender of the notes. The issuer and the guarantors will keep the registered exchange offer open for not less than 20 business days (or longer if required by applicable law) after the date notice of the registered exchange offer is mailed to the holders and to consummate the registered exchange offer no later than 35 days (or longer if required by applicable law) after the date notice of the registered exchange offer is mailed to the holders. For each note surrendered to the issuer pursuant to the registered exchange offer, the holder of such note will receive an exchange note having a principal amount equal to that of the surrendered note. Interest on each exchange note will accrue from the last interest payment date on which interest was paid on the note surrendered in exchange therefor or, if no interest has been paid on such note, from the date of its original issue. Under existing SEC interpretations, the exchange notes will be freely transferable by holders other than affiliates of an issuer after the registered exchange offer without further registration under the Securities Act if the holder of the exchange notes represents that it is acquiring the exchange notes in the ordinary course of its business, that it has no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution of the exchange notes and that it is not an affiliate of an issuer, as such terms are interpreted by the SEC; provided that broker-dealers receiving exchange notes in the registered exchange offer will have a prospectus delivery requirement with respect to resales of such exchange notes. While the SEC has not taken a position with respect to this particular transaction, under existing SEC interpretations relating to transactions structured substantially like the registered exchange offer, participating broker-dealers may fulfill their prospectus delivery requirements with respect to exchange notes (other than a resale of an unsold allotment of the notes) with the prospectus contained in the exchange offer registration statement. Under the registration rights agreements, the issuer will be required to allow participating broker-dealers and other persons, if any, with similar prospectus delivery requirements to use the prospectus contained in the exchange offer registration statement in connection with the resale of such exchange notes for 180 days following the effective date of such exchange offer registration statement (or such shorter period during which participating broker-dealers are required by law to deliver such prospectuses). A holder of notes (other than certain specified holders) who wishes to exchange such notes for exchange notes in the registered exchange offer will be required to represent that any exchange notes to be received by it will be acquired in the ordinary course of its business and that at the time of the commencement of the exchange offer it has no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution (within the meaning of the Securities Act) of the exchange notes and that it is not an “affiliate” of an issuer, as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act, or if it is an affiliate of an issuer, that it will comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act to the extent applicable.

The issuer and the guarantors will, in the event a shelf registration statement is filed, among other things, provide to each holder for whom such shelf registration statement was filed copies of the prospectus which forms a part of the shelf registration statement, notify each such holder when the shelf registration statement has become effective and take certain other actions as are required to permit unrestricted resales of the notes or the exchange notes, as the case may be. A holder selling such notes or exchange notes pursuant to the shelf registration statement generally would be required to be named as a selling security holder in the related prospectus and to deliver a prospectus to purchasers, will be subject to certain of the civil liability provisions under the Securities Act in connection with such sales and will be bound by the provisions of the registration rights agreement which are applicable to such holder (including certain indemnification obligations). In the event that: - within 360 days after the issue date of the notes, the registered exchange offer has not been completed; - if required, the shelf registration statement has not been filed by the deadline provided for in the registration rights agreement or has not been declared effective by the deadline provided for in the registration rights agreement; or - after the shelf registration statement has been declared effective, such registration statement thereafter ceases to be effective or usable (subject to certain exceptions) in connection with resales of notes or exchange notes in accordance with and during the periods specified in the registration rights agreement (each such event a “registration default”), additional interest will accrue on the notes and the exchange notes (in addition to the stated interest on the notes and the exchange notes) from and including the date on which any such registration default has occurred to but excluding the date on which all registration defaults have been cured. Additional interest will accrue at a rate of 0.25% per annum during the 90-day period immediately following the occurrence of any registration default and will increase by 0.25% per annum at the end of each subsequent 90day period, but in no event will such rate exceed 1.00% per annum in the aggregate regardless of the number of registration defaults.
