**SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REVIEW**

In the course of the review by the SEC of any reports that Crown may file under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or any registration statement that Crown may file with the SEC
including any exchange offer registration statement or shelf registration statement relating to the notes, the SEC may
review and comment upon those filings, and it is possible that changes or deletions will have to be made to the
description of Crown’s business and other information, including financial information, in this offering
memorandum. As a result, any registration statement that Crown may file may differ in important ways from this
offering memorandum in order to comply with SEC rules, including the rules governing the presentation of nonGAAP measures. In particular, any such registration statement may not include the measures of EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA or the presentation of financial data for the twelve months ended or adjusted financial data as of December
31, 2021. For a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA used in this offering memorandum, see
“Summary—Summary Historical Financial Data.”

**MARKETS, RANKING AND OTHER DATA**

The data included in this offering memorandum regarding markets and ranking, including the position of
Crown and Crown’s competitors within these markets, are based on independent industry publications, reports of
government agencies or other published industry sources and the estimates of Crown based on its management’s
knowledge and experience in the markets in which it operates. Crown’s estimates have been based on information
obtained from customers, suppliers, trade and business organizations and other contacts in the markets in which it
operates. Industry publications and surveys generally state that they have obtained information from sources
believed to be reliable, but do not guarantee the accuracy and completeness of such information. While Crown
believes that each of these studies and publications is reliable, neither Crown nor the initial purchasers have
independently verified such data and neither Crown nor the initial purchasers make any representation as to the
accuracy of such information. Similarly, Crown believes its internal research is reliable but it has not been verified
by any independent sources.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Financial Information**

**_General. The financial information included in this offering memorandum has been derived from our audited_**
consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 and for the years ended December 31, 2019,
2020 and 2021, together with the notes thereto, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (“U.S. GAAP”), which are incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum;

Our audited consolidated financial statements have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
(“PricewaterhouseCoopers”), our independent registered public accounting firm. The report of
PricewaterhouseCoopers is incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum.

**Currency and other Information**

In this offering memorandum, references to “$”, “U.S. dollars”, “USD” and “dollars” are to United States
dollars, and references to “€” or “euro” are to euros.

This offering memorandum contains translations of certain euro amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates
solely for the convenience of the reader. These translations should not be construed as representations that the euro
amounts actually represent such U.S. dollar amounts or could be converted into U.S. dollars at the rates indicated, at
any particular rate or at all.

Unless otherwise noted, all financial data presented herein is stated in U.S. dollars and in millions.

**_Rounding. Certain figures included in this offering memorandum have been rounded for ease of_**
presentation. Percentage figures included in this offering memorandum have not in all cases been calculated on the
basis of such rounded figures but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, certain percentage
amounts in this offering memorandum may vary from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the
figures in our consolidated financial statements. Certain other amounts that appear in this offering memorandum
may not sum due to rounding.

**_Other Information. We own or have rights to use the trademarks, service marks and trade names that we_**
use in conjunction with the operation of our business. Solely for convenience, we may refer to our trademarks,
service marks and trade names in this offering memorandum without the TM and ® symbols, but such references are
not intended to indicate in any way that we will not assert, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, our
rights to our trademarks, service marks and trade names.

**SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

This offering memorandum makes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, namely EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA of Crown. These non-GAAP measures are not recognized measures under U.S. GAAP, do
not have a standard meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar
measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to
complement U.S. GAAP measures by providing further understanding of Crown’s results of operations from
management’s perspective. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of
our financial information reported under U.S. GAAP.

Crown calculates EBITDA as net income plus the sum of income taxes, interest expense (net of interest
income) and depreciation and amortization. Crown calculates Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus the sum of
restructuring and other, including asset impairments and provision for asbestos, loss from early extinguishments of
debt, other pension and postretirement, foreign exchange, equity earnings and discontinued operations. For a
reconciliation of EBITDA to net income, and of Adjusted EBITDA to EBITDA, see “Summary— Summary
Historical Financial Data.”


-----

We have included EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to provide investors with a supplemental measure of
our performance. We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are important supplemental measures of performance
because they eliminate items that may have less bearing on our performance and thus highlight trends in our core
business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP financial measures. We also believe
that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use EBITDA in the evaluation of issuer,
many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results.

Our management also uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in order to facilitate performance comparisons
from period to period, prepare annual operating budgets and assess our ability to meet our future debt service,
capital expenditure and working capital requirements.

A limitation associated with EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is that they do not reflect the periodic costs of
certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the business. Any measure that
eliminates components of the capital structure and costs associated with carrying significant amounts of assets on its
balance sheet has material limitations as a performance measure. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible
and intangible assets through other financial measures such as capital expenditures. In addition, in evaluating
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that the adjustments may vary from period to period and in
the future Crown will incur expenses such as those used in calculating these measures. Furthermore, EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by Crown within this document, may not be comparable to calculations of
similarly titled measures by other companies. In light of the foregoing limitations, Crown does not rely solely on
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as performance measures and also considers its results as calculated in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. For purposes of the covenants in the indenture governing the notes, EBITDA is defined
differently, and for purposes of our credit facility and for reviewing goodwill for impairment, Adjusted EBITDA is
defined differently.

This offering memorandum also makes reference to segment income and free cash flow, which are not
defined terms under U.S. GAAP. In addition, the information presented in this offering memorandum excluding the
impact of currency translation, and regarding net income before certain items does not conform to U.S. GAAP and
includes non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute
for net income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to
calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies.

We view segment income as the principal measure of performance of our operations and free cash flow as
the principal measure of our liquidity. We consider both of these measures in the allocation of resources. Free cash
flow has certain limitations, however, including that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for
discretionary expenditures since other non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt service requirements,
are not deducted from the measure. The amount of non-discretionary versus discretionary expenditures can vary
significantly between periods. We believe that net income before certain items is useful in evaluating Crown’s
operations as this measure is adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods.


-----

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

Statements included in this offering memorandum that are not historical facts (including any statements
concerning plans and objectives of management for future operations or economic performance, or assumptions
related thereto) are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws. Forwardlooking statements can be identified by words, such as “believes,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “expects” and other

- the outcome of asbestos-related litigation (including the number and size of future claims and the terms of
settlements, and the impact of bankruptcy filings by other companies with asbestos-related liabilities, any
of which could increase the asbestos-related costs to Crown Cork & Seal Company, Inc., a subsidiary of
Crown (“Crown Cork”), over time, the adequacy of reserves established for asbestos-related liabilities,
Crown Cork’s ability to obtain resolution without payment of asbestos-related claims by persons alleging
first exposure to asbestos after 1964, and the impact of state legislation dealing with asbestos liabilities and

(1) On August 31, 2021, Crown completed the sale of its European Tinplate business, which now does

business under the name Eviosys, to KPS Capital Partners, LP (the “European Tinplate Sale”). The
European Tinplate business comprised Crown’s European Food segment and its European Aerosol and
Promotional Packaging reporting unit which was previously reported in Crown’s other segments. Crown
received a 20% ownership stake in the European Tinplate business following the sale.

**Reportable Segments**

Crown’s business is generally organized by product line and geography. The reportable segments are:
Americas Beverage, European Beverage, Asia Pacific and Transit Packaging (and prior to the European Tinplate
Sale, Crown also maintained a separate reportable segment for European Food). Crown also has other businesses,
including its food can, aerosol can and closures business in North America and beverage tooling and equipment
operations in the U.S. and U.K., which it reports under the “Other” segment.

**Business Strengths**

Crown’s principal strength lies in its ability to meet the changing needs of its global customer base with
products and processes from a broad range of well-established packaging businesses. Crown believes that it is wellpositioned within the packaging industry because of its:


-----

  - **_Global leadership positions. Crown is a leading producer of beverage cans in North America, Europe and_**
Asia, and is a leading producer of food and aerosol cans and closures in North America. Crown maintains
its leadership through an extensive geographic presence, with 200 plants located throughout the world as of
December 31, 2021. Its large manufacturing base allows Crown to service its customers locally while
achieving significant economies of scale.

  - **_Strong customer base. Crown provides packaging to many of the world’s leading consumer products_**
companies. Major customers include Anheuser-Busch InBev, Coca-Cola, Heineken, Keurig Dr Pepper,
Molson Coors, Pepsi-Cola and Refresco, among others. These consumer products companies represent
generally stable businesses that provide consumer staples such as soft drinks and alcoholic beverages. In
addition, Crown has long-standing relationships with many of its largest customers.

  - **_Broad and diversified product base. Crown continues to drive brand differentiation in the beverage can_**
market by increasing its ability to offer multiple specialty can sizes. Size variations include slim and sleek
cans, as well as larger sizes to help customers differentiate their products.

  - **_Business and industry fundamentals. Fundamental changes in its business, including global beverage can_**
demand, price increases, cost reduction initiatives and working capital reductions, have improved Crown’s
business outlook.

  - **_Technological leadership resulting in superior new product and process development. Crown believes_**
that it possesses the technology, processes and research, development and engineering capabilities to allow
it to provide innovative and value-added packaging solutions to its customers, as well as to design costefficient manufacturing systems and materials.

  - **_Financially disciplined management team. Crown’s current executive leadership is focused on improving_**
profit and increasing free cash flow. Crown is prudent about its capital spending, attempting to pursue
projects that provide an adequate return.

**Business Strategy**

Crown has several key business strategies:

  - **_Grow in targeted markets. Crown plans to capitalize on its leading positions by targeting geographic areas_**
with strong growth potential. Crown believes that it is well-positioned to take advantage of the growth
potential in North America, Mexico, Brazil and Southeast Asia with recent capacity additions concentrated
in these markets. Crown also benefits from anticipated growth in the consumption of consumer goods in
Western Europe.

  - **_Increase margins through ongoing cost reductions. Crown plans to continue to reduce manufacturing_**
costs, enhance efficiencies and drive return on invested capital through investments in equipment and
technology and through improvements in productivity and material usage and by maintaining a disciplined
approach to managing supplier contracts.

  - **_Maximize cash flow generation. Crown has established performance-based incentives to increase its free_**
cash flow and operating income. In recent years, Crown has used proceeds from the sale of the European
Tinplate business, along with cash provided by operating activities, to support Crown’s capital allocation
strategy to reduce leverage, support beverage can expansion in North America, Western Europe and
emerging markets, and return capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchase of Crown’s
shares.

    - Crown uses the economic profit concept in connection with its executive compensation program,
which requires each business unit to exceed prior year’s returns on the capital that it employs.

    - Crown will continue to focus its capital expenditures on projects that provide an adequate return.

   - **_Serve the changing needs of the world’s leading consumer products companies through technological_**

**_innovation. Crown intends to capitalize on the demand of its customers for higher value-added packaging_**
products. By continuing to improve the physical attributes of its products, such as strength of materials and
graphics, Crown plans to further improve its existing customer relationships, as well as attract new
customers.

**The Offering**

The summary below describes the principal terms of the notes. Certain of the terms and conditions
described below are subject to important limitations and exceptions. The “Description of the Notes” section of this
offering memorandum contains a more detailed description of the terms and conditions of the notes.

Issuer Crown Americas LLC, a Pennsylvania limited liability company.

Notes Offered $500 million principal amount of    % Senior Notes due 2030.

Maturity, 2030

Interest Interest on the notes will accrue from and including the original issue
date of the notes and will be payable on     and     of each year
commencing on   , 2022.

Ranking and Guarantees The notes will be senior obligations of Crown Americas, ranking senior
in right of payment to all subordinated indebtedness of Crown
Americas, and will be unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured
senior basis by Crown and each of Crown’s present and future U.S.
subsidiaries (other than Crown Americas, Crown Americas Capital
Corp., Crown Americas Capital Corp. II, Crown Americas Capital
Corp. III, Crown Americas Capital Corp. IV, Crown Americas Capital
Corp. V and Crown Americas Capital Corp. VI) that from time to time
are obligors under or guarantee Crown’s senior secured credit facilities.

The notes and note guarantees will be senior unsecured obligations of
the issuer and the guarantors,

                          - effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured
indebtedness of the issuer and the guarantors, including any
borrowings under Crown’s senior secured credit facilities, to the
extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness;

                          - structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of subsidiaries of
Crown that do not guarantee the notes offered hereby which
include all of Crown’s foreign subsidiaries and any U.S.
subsidiaries that are neither obligors nor guarantors of Crown’s
senior secured credit facilities;

                          - ranking equal in right of payment to any existing or future senior
indebtedness of the issuer and the guarantors; and


-----

                          - ranking senior in right of payment to all existing and future
subordinated indebtedness of the issuer and the guarantors.

Upon the release of any note guarantor from each of its guarantee and
other obligations which resulted in the requirement to guarantee the
notes offered hereby, unless there is existing a default or event of
default under the indenture governing the notes, the guarantee of the
notes by such note guarantor will also be released.

As of December 31, 2021, Crown and its subsidiaries had
approximately $6.3 billion of indebtedness, including $1.4 billion of
secured indebtedness and $3.2 billion of additional indebtedness of
non-guarantor subsidiaries.

The guarantees will be subject to significant contractual and legal
limitations and may be released under certain circumstances. See “Risk
factors—Risks Related to the Notes” and “Description of the Notes—
Certain Bankruptcy and Fraudulent Transfer Limitations.”

Additional Indebtedness Crown and the issuer may be able to incur additional debt in the future.
Although Crown’s senior secured credit facilities contain restrictions
on Crown’s ability to incur indebtedness, those restrictions are subject
to a number of exceptions.

Net Sales and Adjusted EBITDA For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the non-guarantor
from Non-Guarantors subsidiaries of Crown represented in the aggregate approximately 64%
of consolidated net sales (calculated using $7,333 million of net sales
by non-guarantor subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2021, divided by Crown’s total consolidated net sales of $11,394
million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021).
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the non-guarantor
subsidiaries of Crown represented in the aggregate approximately 74%
of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (calculated using $1,309 million of
Adjusted EBITDA from non-guarantor subsidiaries for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2021, divided by Crown’s total consolidated
Adjusted EBITDA of $1,782 million for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2021). See page 9 of this offering memorandum for a
definition of Adjusted EBITDA.

Optional Redemption The issuer may redeem some or all of the notes prior to          ,
2030 (three months prior to the scheduled maturity of the notes) at a
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the
redemption date and a “make-whole” premium, as described in this
offering memorandum. The notes will be redeemable at any time on or
after          , 2030 (three months prior to the scheduled maturity
date of the notes) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to but excluding the redemption date. See “Description of the Notes—
Optional Redemption.”


-----

Change of Control Upon a “change of control repurchase event” of Crown or Crown
Americas, as defined under the caption “Description of the Notes—
Repurchase at the Option of Holders,” you will have the right, as a
holder of notes, to require Crown to repurchase all or part of your notes
at a repurchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the repurchase
date.

Exchange Offer; Registration Rights The issuer and the guarantors will, pursuant to registration rights
agreements with the initial purchasers, grant the holders certain
exchange and registration rights with respect to the notes. The issuer
and the guarantors will agree to:

                          - use their reasonable best efforts to file and cause to become
effective a registration statement of the notes enabling holders to
exchange their unregistered notes for publicly registered notes with
substantially identical terms;

                          - use their reasonable best efforts to cause the registered exchange
offer to become completed within 360 days after the issue date of
the notes; and

                          - file a shelf registration statement for the resale of the notes if they
cannot effect the registered exchange offer within the time periods
listed above and in other circumstances described under the
caption “Exchange Offer; Registration Rights.”

The interest rate on the notes will increase if the issuer and the
guarantors do not comply with their obligations under the registration
rights agreements.

Restrictive Covenants The indenture governing the notes will limit, among other things,
Crown’s ability and the ability of certain of its subsidiaries (including
the issuer) to incur secured indebtedness and engage in certain sale and
leaseback transactions.

These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and
limitations that are described under the caption “Description of the
Notes—Certain Covenants.”

Transfer Restrictions The notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state or
other securities laws and the notes are subject to restrictions on transfer.
See “Notice to Investors.”

Use of Proceeds The net proceeds from this offering will be used for general corporate
purposes. See “Use of Proceeds.”

Original Issue Discount The stated principal amount of the notes may exceed the issue price of
the notes by an amount that equals or exceeds the statutory de minimis
amount, and accordingly, the notes may be issued with original issue
discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to such
excess. In such event, investors in the notes that are subject to U.S.
federal income taxation will generally be required to include such OID
in their gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as it accrues on a constant yield-to-maturity basis, regardless
of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax
purposes and generally in advance of the receipt of cash payments


-----

attributable to such OID. See “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations.”

Risk Factors An investment in the notes involves risks. You should carefully
consider all of the information in this offering memorandum. In
particular, you should evaluate the specific risk factors set forth under
the caption “Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum before making
a decision whether to invest in the notes.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are provided for illustrative and informational purposes only and do not purport to represent, and should
not be viewed as indicative of, Crown’s actual or future financial condition or results of operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not
represent and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any
other measure of operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
information is unaudited and has been included in this offering memorandum because Crown believes that certain analysts, rating agencies
and investors may use it as supplemental information to evaluate a company’s ability to service its indebtedness and overall performance
over time. However, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have material limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation,
or as substitutes for analysis of Crown’s results as reported under U.S. GAAP. A limitation associated with EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
is that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in Crown’s
business. Any measure that eliminates components of Crown’s capital structure and costs associated with carrying significant amounts of
assets on its balance sheet has material limitations as a performance measure. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and
intangible assets through other financial measures such as capital expenditures. In addition, in evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA,
you should be aware that the adjustments may vary from period to period and in the future Crown will incur expenses such as those used in
calculating these measures. Furthermore, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by Crown, may not be comparable to calculations
of similarly titled measures by other companies. In light of the foregoing limitations, Crown does not rely solely on EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA as performance measures and also considers its results as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For purposes of the
covenants in the indenture governing the notes, EBITDA is defined differently, and for purposes of our credit facility and reviewing
goodwill for impairment, Adjusted EBITDA is defined differently.

(3) Working capital consists of current assets less current liabilities.

**RISK FACTORS**

_This offering involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below as well_
_as other information and data included or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum before making an_
_investment decision, including the information contained in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on_
_Form 10-K filed with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not_
_currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. The actual_
_occurrence of any of these risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of_
_operations, ability to meet our financial obligations and prospects, in which case you may lose part or all of your_
_investment._

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_The substantial indebtedness of Crown could prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under its indebtedness,_**
**_including the notes and the note guarantees._**

Crown has substantial outstanding indebtedness. As a result of Crown’s substantial indebtedness, a
significant portion of Crown’s cash flow will be required to pay interest and principal on its outstanding
indebtedness, and Crown may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or have future borrowings available
under its senior secured credit facilities, to enable it to repay its indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund other
liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2021, Crown and its subsidiaries had approximately $6.3 billion of
indebtedness, excluding unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, including approximately $1.4 billion of
secured indebtedness and $3.2 billion of additional indebtedness of non-guarantor subsidiaries and the ability to
borrow $1.5 billion under Crown’s senior secured revolving credit facilities.

The substantial indebtedness of Crown could:

    - make it more difficult for Crown and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations with respect to the
notes, such as the issuer’s obligation to purchase notes tendered as a result of a change in control of
Crown;

    - increase Crown’s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including rising
interest rates;

    - restrict Crown from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities, including any
planned expansion in emerging markets;

    - limit Crown’s ability to make capital expenditures both domestically and internationally in order to
grow Crown’s business or maintain manufacturing plants in good working order and repair;

    - limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants under Crown’s indebtedness, Crown’s
ability to obtain additional financing, dispose of assets or pay cash dividends;

    - require Crown to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to service its
indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund future working capital, capital
expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

    - require Crown to sell assets used in its business;

    - limit Crown’s ability to refinance its existing indebtedness, particularly during periods of adverse
credit market conditions when refinancing indebtedness may not be available under interest rates and
other terms acceptable to Crown or at all;

    - increase Crown’s cost of borrowing;

    - limit Crown’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in
which it operates; and

    - place Crown at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt.


-----

If its financial condition, operating results and liquidity deteriorate, Crown’s creditors may restrict its
ability to obtain future financing and its suppliers could require prepayment or cash on delivery rather than extend
credit which could further diminish Crown’s ability to generate cash flows from operations sufficient to service its
debt obligations. In addition, Crown’s ability to make payments on and refinance its debt and to fund its operations
will depend on Crown’s ability to generate cash in the future.

**_Crown and Crown Americas are holding companies with no direct operations and the notes will be_**
**_structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of Crown’s subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes._**

Crown and Crown Americas are holding companies with no direct operations and for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2021, the subsidiaries of Crown that do not guarantee the notes represented in the aggregate
approximately 64% of consolidated net sales and 74% of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. The principal assets of
Crown and Crown Americas are the equity interests and investments they hold in their subsidiaries. As a result, they
depend on dividends and other payments from their subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet their
financial obligations, including the payment of principal of and interest on their outstanding debt. Their subsidiaries
are legally distinct from them and have no obligation to pay amounts due on their debt or to make funds available to
them for such payment except as provided in the note guarantees or pursuant to intercompany notes. Not all of
Crown’s or Crown Americas’ subsidiaries will guarantee the notes. Specifically, none of Crown’s or Crown
Americas’ foreign subsidiaries are expected to guarantee the notes. A holder of notes will not have any claim as a
creditor against subsidiaries of Crown that are not guarantors of the notes, and the indebtedness and other liabilities,
including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those non-guarantor subsidiaries will be effectively
senior to your claims.

**_The notes do not impose any limitations on Crown’s ability to incur additional debt, guarantees or other_**
**_obligations or make restricted payments._**

The indenture that will govern the notes does not restrict the future incurrence of unsecured indebtedness,
guarantees or other obligations. Except for the limitations on granting liens on the capital stock and indebtedness of
its subsidiaries and on certain limited assets Crown and certain of its subsidiaries own (or on entering into sale and
leaseback transactions with respect to those assets), the indenture will not restrict Crown’s ability to incur secured
indebtedness, grant liens on its assets or engage in sale and leaseback transactions. See “Description of the Notes—
Limitation on Liens” and “Description of the Notes—Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions.”

**_Your right to receive payments on the notes is effectively subordinated to Crown’s existing secured_**
**_indebtedness, including Crown’s existing senior secured credit facilities, and possible future secured_**
**_borrowings._**

The notes and the note guarantees will be effectively subordinated to the prior payment in full of Crown’s,
Crown Americas’ and the guarantors’ current and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets
securing such indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, Crown and its subsidiaries had approximately $6.3 billion of
indebtedness, excluding unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs, including approximately $1.4 billion of
secured indebtedness and $3.2 billion of additional indebtedness of non-guarantor subsidiaries and the ability to
borrow $1.5 billion under Crown’s senior secured revolving credit facilities. Such secured indebtedness may
increase if Crown incurs secured indebtedness, including under Crown’s senior secured revolving credit facilities, to
finance an acquisition, fund dividends or the repurchase of Crown common stock or otherwise. Because of the liens
on the assets securing the senior secured credit facilities, in the event of the bankruptcy, wind-up, reorganization,
liquidation or dissolution of the borrowers or any guarantor of such indebtedness, the assets of the borrowers or
guarantors would be available to pay obligations under the notes offered hereby and other unsecured obligations
only after payments had been made on the borrowers’ or the guarantors’ secured indebtedness. Sufficient assets may
not remain after these payments have been made to make any payments on the notes offered hereby and Crown’s
other unsecured obligations, including payments of interest when due. Holders of the notes offered hereby will
participate ratably with all holders of other unsecured obligations that are deemed to be of the same class as the
notes offered hereby, and potentially with all of Crown’s other general creditors, based upon the respective amounts
owed to each holder or creditor, in Crown’s remaining assets. As a result, holders of the notes offered hereby may
receive less ratably than holders of secured indebtedness. In addition, all payments on the notes and the note
guarantees will be prohibited in the event of a payment default on Crown’s secured indebtedness (including


-----

borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities) and, for limited periods, upon the occurrence of other defaults
under the existing senior secured credit facilities. See “Description of Certain Indebtedness.”

**_Crown may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness, including the notes_**
**_offered hereby, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness, which_**
**_may not be successful._**

Crown’s ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance its indebtedness, including the notes
offered hereby, and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts, will depend on
Crown’s ability to generate cash in the future. This is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative,
regulatory and other factors that may be beyond Crown’s control.

We cannot assure you, however, that Crown’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations
or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable Crown to pay its indebtedness,
including the notes offered hereby, or to fund its other liquidity needs. If Crown’s cash flows and capital resources
are insufficient to fund its debt service obligations, Crown may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures,
sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance its indebtedness, including the notes
offered hereby. We cannot assure you that Crown would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions
would be successful and permitted under the terms of Crown’s existing or future debt agreements or that Crown
could release from these actions sufficient proceeds to meet any debt service obligations then due.

**_Notwithstanding Crown’s current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, Crown may still be able to_**
**_incur substantial additional debt or make certain restricted payments, which could exacerbate the risks_**
**_described above._**

Crown may be able to incur additional debt in the future, including in connection with acquisitions or joint
ventures. Although Crown’s senior secured credit facilities and indentures governing its outstanding notes contain
restrictions on Crown’s ability to incur indebtedness, those restrictions are subject to a number of exceptions, and,
under certain circumstances, indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Crown
may also consider investments in joint ventures or acquisitions or increased capital expenditures, which may
increase Crown’s indebtedness. Moreover, although Crown’s senior secured credit facilities and indentures
governing certain of its outstanding notes contain restrictions on Crown’s ability to make restricted payments,
including the declaration and payment of dividends and the repurchase of Crown’s common stock, Crown is able to
make such restricted payments under certain circumstances which may increase indebtedness. In December 2021,
Crown's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an aggregate amount of $3 billion of Crown common stock
through the end of 2024 and Crown currently pays a quarterly cash dividend of 22 cents per share to its
shareholders. Adding new debt to current debt levels or making otherwise restricted payments could intensify the
related risks that Crown and its subsidiaries now face. See “Capitalization” and “Description of Certain
Indebtedness.”

**_Restrictive covenants in the debt agreements governing Crown’s other current or future indebtedness could_**
**_restrict Crown’s operating flexibility._**

The indentures and the agreements governing Crown’s senior secured credit facilities and certain of its
outstanding notes contain affirmative and negative covenants that limit the ability of Crown and its subsidiaries to
take certain actions. These restrictions may limit Crown’s ability to operate its businesses and may prohibit or limit
its ability to enhance its operations or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.

Crown’s senior secured credit facilities require Crown to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy
other financial conditions. The agreements or indentures governing Crown’s senior secured credit facilities and
certain of its outstanding notes restrict, among other things, the ability of Crown and the ability of all or substantially
all of its subsidiaries to:

    - incur additional debt;

    - pay dividends or make other distributions, repurchase capital stock, repurchase subordinated debt and
make certain investments or loans;


-----

    - create liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions;

    - create restrictions on the payment of dividends and other amounts to Crown from subsidiaries;

    - make loans, investments and capital expenditures;

    - change accounting treatment and reporting practices;

    - enter into agreements restricting the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends to, make or repay loans to,
transfer property to, or guarantee indebtedness of, Crown or any of its subsidiaries;

    - sell or acquire assets, enter into leaseback transactions and merge or consolidate with or into other
companies; and

    - engage in transactions with affiliates.

In addition, the indentures and the agreements governing Crown’s senior secured credit facilities and
certain of its outstanding notes limit, among other things, the ability of Crown to enter into certain transactions, such
as mergers, consolidations, joint ventures, asset sales, sale and leaseback transactions and the pledging of assets.

Furthermore, if Crown or certain of its subsidiaries experience specific kinds of changes of control,
Crown’s senior secured credit facilities will be due and payable and Crown will be required to offer to repurchase
outstanding notes.

The breach of any of these covenants by Crown or the failure by Crown to meet any of these ratios or
conditions could result in a default under any or all of such indebtedness. If a default occurs under any such
indebtedness, all of the outstanding obligations thereunder could become immediately due and payable, which could
result in a default under Crown’s other outstanding debt and could lead to an acceleration of obligations related to
the notes and other outstanding debt. The ability of Crown to comply with these covenants or indentures governing
other indebtedness it may incur in the future and its outstanding notes can be affected by events beyond its control
and, therefore, it may be unable to meet these ratios and conditions.

**_Crown is subject to certain restrictions that may limit its ability to make payments on its debt, including on_**
**_the notes and the note guarantees, out of the cash reserves shown on Crown’s consolidated financial_**
**_statements._**

The ability of Crown’s subsidiaries and joint ventures to pay dividends, make distributions, provide loans
or make other payments to Crown may be restricted by applicable state and foreign laws, potentially adverse tax
consequences and their agreements, including agreements governing their debt.

In addition, the equity interests of Crown’s joint venture partners or other shareholders in Crown’s nonwholly owned subsidiaries in any dividend or other distribution made by these entities would need to be satisfied on
a proportionate basis with Crown. As a result, Crown may not be able to access the cash flow of these entities to
service its debt, including the notes, and Crown cannot assure you that the amount of cash and cash flow reflected
on Crown’s financial statements will be fully available to Crown.

**_The note guarantee of a subsidiary guarantor will be released if such subsidiary guarantor no longer_**
**_guarantees or is otherwise an obligor of indebtedness under any Crown credit facility._**

Any subsidiary guarantee of the notes may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the
notes or the trustee under the indenture if the subsidiary guarantor is no longer a guarantor or an obligor of any
Crown credit facility or other indebtedness as described under “Description of the Notes—Ranking and
Guarantees.” The lenders under Crown’s senior secured credit facilities will have the discretion to release the
subsidiary guarantees under the senior secured credit facilities in a variety of circumstances. You will not have a
claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a subsidiary guarantor of the notes, and the indebtedness
and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those subsidiaries will effectively be
senior to your claims.


-----

**_The notes and the note guarantees may be voidable, subordinated or limited in scope under insolvency,_**
**_fraudulent transfer, corporate or other laws._**

Fraudulent transfer and insolvency laws may void, subordinate or limit the notes and the note guarantees.

See “Description of the Notes—Certain Bankruptcy and Fraudulent Transfer Limitations.”

Under U.S. federal bankruptcy laws or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, the issuance
of the note guarantees by Crown and the subsidiary guarantors could be voided, or claims in respect of such
obligations could be subordinated to all of their other debts and other liabilities, if, among other things, at the time
Crown and/or the subsidiary guarantors issued the related note guarantees, Crown or the applicable subsidiary
guarantor intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor, or received less than reasonably
equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of such indebtedness and either:

    - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

    - was engaged in a business or transaction for which Crown’s or such subsidiary guarantor’s remaining
assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or

    - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they
mature.

By its terms, the note guarantee of each guarantor will limit the liability of each such guarantor to the
maximum amount it can pay without the note guarantee being deemed a fraudulent transfer.

**_Crown’s senior secured credit facilities, the notes and other indebtedness provide that certain change of_**
**_control events constitute an event of default. In the event of a change of control, Crown, Crown Americas_**
**_and the guarantors may not be able to satisfy all of their obligations under the senior secured credit facilities,_**
**_the notes or other indebtedness._**

Crown, Crown Americas and the guarantors may not have sufficient assets or be able to obtain sufficient
third-party financing on favorable terms to satisfy all of their obligations under Crown’s senior secured credit
facilities, the notes or other indebtedness in the event of a change of control. If Crown or Crown Americas
experiences a change of control repurchase event, the issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding
notes. However, Crown’s senior secured credit facilities provide that certain change of control events constitute an
event of default under the senior secured credit facilities. Such an event of default entitles the lenders thereunder to,
among other things, cause all outstanding debt obligations under the senior secured credit facilities to become due
and payable and to proceed against the collateral securing the senior secured credit facilities. Any event of default or
acceleration of the senior secured credit facilities will likely also cause a default under the terms of other
indebtedness of Crown.

In addition, Crown’s senior secured credit facilities contain, and any future credit facilities or other
agreements to which Crown becomes a party may contain, restrictions on its ability to offer to repurchase the notes
in connection with a change of control. In the event a change of control repurchase event occurs at a time when it is
prohibited from offering to purchase the notes, the issuer could seek consent to offer to purchase the notes or attempt
to refinance the borrowings that contain such a prohibition. If it does not obtain the consent or refinance the
borrowings, the issuer would remain prohibited from offering to purchase the notes. In such case, the failure by the
issuer to offer to purchase the notes would constitute a default under the indenture governing the notes, which, in
turn, could result in amounts outstanding under any future credit facility or other agreement relating to indebtedness
being declared due and payable. Any such declaration could have adverse consequences to Crown, the issuer and the
holders of the notes.

**_You may not be able to determine when a change of control repurchase event has occurred and may not be_**
**_able to require the issuer to purchase the notes as a result of a change in the composition of the directors on_**
**_Crown’s board of directors._**

Legal uncertainty regarding what constitutes a change of control repurchase event and the provisions of the
indenture may allow Crown to enter into transactions, such as acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, that


-----

would not constitute a change of control repurchase event but may increase Crown’s outstanding indebtedness or
otherwise affect Crown’s ability to satisfy its obligations under the notes. The definition of change of control
includes a phrase relating to the transfer of “all or substantially all” of the assets of Crown and its subsidiaries taken
as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no
precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, your ability to require the issuer to
repurchase notes as a result of a transfer of less than all of the assets of Crown to another person may be uncertain.

In addition, in a 2009 decision, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware raised the possibility that a
change of control put right occurring as a result of a failure to have “continuing directors” comprising a majority of
a board of directors might be unenforceable on public policy grounds.

**_If an active trading market for the notes does not develop, the liquidity and value of the notes could be_**
**_harmed._**

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act. Accordingly, the notes may only be offered or
sold pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or pursuant to an effective
registration statement. There is no existing market for the notes and the issuer cannot assure you that an active
trading market will develop for the notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your
notes at their fair market value or at all. Future trading prices of the notes will depend on many factors, including,
among other things, the issuer’s prevailing interest rates, the issuer’s and Crown’s financial performance or
prospects or the prospects of the companies in their industry and the market for similar securities. Certain of the
initial purchasers have advised the issuer that they currently intend to make a market in the notes after this offering
is completed. However, such initial purchasers may cease their market-making activities at any time. The issuer does
not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any securities exchange.

**_Any decline in the ratings of our corporate credit could adversely affect the value of the notes._**

Any decline in the ratings of our corporate credit or any indications from the rating agencies that their
ratings on our corporate credit are under surveillance or review with possible negative implications could adversely
affect the value of the notes. In addition, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect our ability to access capital.

**_The notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The stated principal amount of the notes may exceed the issue price of the notes by an amount that equals
or exceeds the statutory de minimis amount and, accordingly, the notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal
income tax purposes in an amount equal to such excess. In such event, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
investors in the notes that are subject to U.S. federal income taxation will be required to include such OID in gross
income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes as it accrues on a constant yield-to-maturity basis,
regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and generally in advance of
the receipt of cash payments attributable to such OID. See “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”

**_Crown’s business operations and financial position have been and are expected to continue to be adversely_**
**_affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which may impact the value of the notes._**

The ongoing global outbreak of COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health
Organization on March 11, 2020 and a national emergency by the President of the United States on March 13, 2020,
has caused and is continuing to cause business slowdowns and shutdowns and turmoil in the financial markets both
in the U.S. and abroad. Crown is closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on all aspects of its business and
geographies, including how it has impacted and will impact Crown’s employees, customers, suppliers and
distribution channels. The pandemic, as well as the quarantines and other governmental and non-governmental
restrictions which have been imposed throughout the world in an effort to contain, mitigate, or vaccinate against it
and the controversies prompted by such restrictions in some regions, has created significant volatility, uncertainty
and economic disruption which is expected to adversely affect Crown’s business operations and may materially and
adversely affect Crown’s results of operations, cash flows and financial position or Crown’s ability to execute its
short- and long-term business strategies and initiatives. For example, governmental authorities in several regions
(including Pennsylvania, where Crown’s world headquarters are located) have ordered the cessation of all business
activity which is deemed non-essential and there is a risk that these shutdown orders will be extended or expanded
or that similar shutdown orders will be implemented in other regions (particularly in response to newer variant


-----

strains of COVID-19, such as Delta or Omicron); while many beverage and food products are deemed essential,
several jurisdictions have implemented restrictions or prohibitions on the sale of alcoholic beverages which have
reduced the demand for some of Crown’s products. Likewise, Transit Packaging supplies a wide array of industrial
markets which are being negatively affected by a decline in global economic activity.

The magnitude of COVID-19’s ultimate impact on Crown (and therefore on the value of the notes) will
depend on numerous evolving factors, future developments and cascading effects of the coronavirus pandemic that
Crown is not able to predict, including: the severity of the outbreak and the international actions that are being taken
to contain and treat it; the duration of the outbreak and the myriad of business restrictions being imposed as a result
of it; governmental, business and other responses to the outbreak (including limitations on Crown’s operations
and/or mandates that Crown provide products or services); the extent and duration of the effect of the outbreak on
consumer confidence and spending, customer demand and buying patterns; the promotion of “social distancing” and
the adoption of shelter-in-place orders, vaccine mandates and restrictions on exports affecting customers’ demand
for Crown’s products; the extent to which forced remote working arrangements reduce Crown’s ability to effectively
manage its global operations; the impact of the outbreak on Crown’s supply chain (including reductions in supply
that may result in an inability to meet customer demand); the impact of the outbreak on internal controls (including
those over financial reporting); the speed and success of vaccination efforts; any impairment in value of Crown’s
tangible or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of a weaker economic conditions; and the effect of
the ongoing disruption in the capital markets on Crown’s ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to
meet its liquidity needs. Moreover, employee absenteeism due to members of Crown’s workforce being quarantined
or exposed to COVID-19 may impact Crown’s ability to meet staffing needs which, compounded with the effects of
ongoing office and potential factory closures, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, border closures,
and other travel or health-related restrictions, may in turn impair Crown in the manufacture, distribution and sale of
its products (and, as a result, adversely impact the value of the notes).

In addition, while Crown cannot predict the magnitude of the impact that COVID-19 will have on its
customers and suppliers or their financial conditions, any material effect on Crown’s customers or suppliers could
adversely impact Crown. For example, certain of Crown’s suppliers have informed Crown that the coronavirus
outbreak and the resulting business restrictions may constrain supply of necessary materials and Crown may face
difficulty collecting accounts receivable from any of its customers that may be negatively impacted by the
pandemic. The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risk factors discussed in Item 1A of Crown’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 (which is incorporated by reference herein),
any of which could have a material effect on Crown and therefore on the value of the notes. For example, significant
volatility in the equity markets could have a negative impact on the market value of Crown’s pension plan assets
which may substantially increase Crown’s future pension plan funding requirements and could have a negative
impact on Crown’s results of operations, pension plan funded status and future cash flows.

The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on Crown’s business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as
information is rapidly evolving with respect to the duration and severity of the pandemic. At this point, Crown
cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or its overall impact on Crown’s
business or on the notes.

**_Crown is currently operating in a period of economic uncertainty and capital markets disruption, which has_**
**_been significantly impacted by geopolitical instability due to the ongoing military conflict between Russia and_**
**_Ukraine. Crown’s business, financial condition and results of operations, and as a result the value of the_**
**_notes, may be materially adversely affected by any negative impact on the global economy and capital_**
**_markets resulting from the conflict in Ukraine or any other geopolitical tensions._**

U.S. and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical
tensions and the start of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Although the length and impact of the
ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable, the conflict in Ukraine could lead to market disruptions, including
significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain disruptions. Crown is
continuing to monitor the situation in Ukraine and globally and assessing its potential impact on Crown’s
businesses.


-----

Additionally, the conflict in Ukraine has led to sanctions and other penalties being levied by the United
States, European Union and other governmental authorities against Russia and Belarus, among others, including
agreement to remove certain Russian financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunication payment system. Additional potential sanctions and penalties have also been proposed and/or
threatened. Russian military actions and the resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and
financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets, potentially making it more difficult
for Crown to obtain additional funds.

Any of the abovementioned factors could affect Crown’s businesses, prospects, financial condition, and
operating results, and therefore the value of the notes. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and
resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be substantial. Any such disruptions may also
magnify the impact of other risks described in Crown’s Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2021 (which is incorporated by reference herein).

-----

**Outstanding Senior Notes due 2025**

any borrowings under Crown’s senior secured credit facilities;

    - structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of Crown’s non-guarantor subsidiaries;

    - ranking equal in right of payment to any existing or future senior unsecured indebtedness of Crown
European Holdings and the guarantors; and

    - ranking senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of Crown
European Holdings and the guarantors.

Upon the release of any note guarantor from its obligations under Crown’s senior secured credit facilities,

Holdings to repurchase all or part of such notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.

**_Certain Covenants_**

The indenture governing the senior notes due 2025 limits, among other things, Crown’s ability and the
ability of its restricted subsidiaries (including Crown European Holdings) to incur secured indebtedness and engage
in certain sale and leaseback transactions.

Such covenants are subject to certain other exceptions and limitations.

**Outstanding Senior Notes due 2024**

On September 15, 2016, Crown European Holdings issued senior notes under an indenture among Crown
European Holdings, the guarantors named therein, U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, Elavon Financial
Services Limited, U.K. Branch, as paying agent, and Elavon Financial Services Limited, as registrar and transfer
agent.

**_Ranking and Guarantees_**

The senior notes due 2024 are senior obligations of Crown European Holdings, ranking senior in right of

European Holdings or another guarantor or is otherwise an obligor under Crown’s senior secured facilities, unless
the incurrence of such guarantee is prohibited by the laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation or formation of such
restricted subsidiary.

The senior notes due 2024 and note guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of Crown European
Holdings and the guarantors,

    - effectively ranking junior in right of payment to all existing and future secured indebtedness of the
issuer and the guarantors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, including
any borrowings under Crown’s senior secured credit facilities;

    - structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of Crown’s non-guarantor subsidiaries;

    - ranking equal in right of payment to any existing or future senior unsecured indebtedness of Crown
European Holdings and the guarantors; and


-----

    - ranking senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of Crown
European Holdings and the guarantors.

Upon the release of any note guarantor from its obligations under Crown’s senior secured credit facilities,

guarantee of such notes by such note guarantor will also be released.

**_Optional Redemption_**

Crown European Holdings may redeem some or all of the senior notes due 2024 on or prior to March 31,

**_Change of Control_**

Upon a change of control repurchase event of Crown or Crown European Holdings, as defined under the
indenture for the senior notes due 2024, the holders of such notes will have the right to require Crown European
Holdings to repurchase all or part of such notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.

**_Certain Covenants_**

The indenture governing the senior notes due 2024 limits, among other things, Crown’s ability and the
ability of its restricted subsidiaries (including Crown European Holdings) to incur secured indebtedness and engage
in certain sale and leaseback transactions.

Such covenants are subject to certain other exceptions and limitations.

**Outstanding Senior Notes due 2026**

On September 15, 2016, Crown Americas and Crown Americas Capital Corp. V (“Crown Americas Capital
V”) issued senior unsecured notes under an indenture among Crown Americas and Crown Americas Capital V, the
guarantors named therein and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. Set forth below is a summary of the terms
of the outstanding senior notes due 2026. You should refer to the indenture for all of the terms thereof, which is filed

    - any Transfer directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, by way of consolidation or merger)

the Holders of Notes to which such Note Guarantee relates (i) if a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing under the Indenture as of the time of such proposed release until such time as such Default or
Event of Default is cured or waived (unless such release is in connection with the sale of the Equity Interests in such
Guarantor constituting collateral for a Credit Facility in connection with the exercise of remedies against such

instrument evidencing such release.

the maximum amount it can pay without its Note Guarantee being deemed a fraudulent transfer. See “Risk

100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the applicable
redemption date, plus the Make-Whole Premium (a “Make- Whole Redemption”). The Indenture will provide that

calculation.

market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable securities laws, so long as
such acquisition does not otherwise violate the terms of the Indenture.

redemption will be made by the Trustee in compliance with the requirements of the principal national
securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes to be redeemed are listed or, if the Notes are not so
listed, on a pro rata basis (or if the Notes are held through DTC and if the procedures of DTC at such
time do not permit pro rata redemptions, then by lot or by such other method consistent with the
procedures of DTC that the Trustee in its sole discretion deems fair and reasonable); provided that no
Notes with a principal amount of $2,000 or less shall be redeemed in part. Notice of redemption shall

Holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only,
the notice of redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount
thereof to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will
be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. On and after the
redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on such Notes or portions thereof called for
redemption. Redemption amounts shall only be paid upon presentation and surrender of any such
Notes to be redeemed.

Any redemption and notice thereof pursuant to the Indenture may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to
the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent.


-----

**Mandatory Redemption**

Except as set forth below under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders,” the Issuer is not required to
make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control Repurchase Events_**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Repurchase Event, each Holder of Notes will have the right to
require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of
such Holder’s Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at an offer price in cash
equal to 101% of their aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to but excluding
the purchase date (the “Change of Control Payment”). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Repurchase
Event or, at the Issuer’s option, prior to the consummation of such Change of Control Repurchase Event but after the
public announcement thereof, the Issuer will mail a notice to each Holder describing the transaction or transactions
that constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and offering to repurchase Notes on the purchase date
specified in such notice (which must be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is
mailed, other than as required by law) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”) pursuant to the procedures required
by the Indenture and described in such notice. Such obligation will not continue after a discharge of the Issuer or
defeasance from their obligations with respect to the Notes. See “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance.”

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof (in minimum amounts of $2,000 or an integral multiple of

$1,000 in excess thereof) properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or

portions thereof properly tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee all Notes so accepted together with an officers’ certificate

stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes (or portions thereof) being purchased by the Issuer.

The Paying Agent will promptly remit to each Holder of Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment
for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to
each Holder of Notes a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if
any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in
excess thereof. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as
practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with
the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of
any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations under this
covenant by virtue thereof.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Indenture will not
contain provisions that permit the Holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in
the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction with respect to Parent or an Issuer.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Repurchase
Event if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance
with the requirements set forth in the Indenture with respect to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and
purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) notice of
redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional
Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of


-----

Control Repurchase Event, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control Repurchase Event, if a
definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control Repurchase Event at the time the Change of Control Offer
is made and such Change of Control Offer is otherwise made in compliance with the provisions of this covenant.

The Existing Credit Facility and other existing Indebtedness of Parent and its Subsidiaries contain, and
their future Indebtedness may contain, prohibitions on the occurrence of certain events that would constitute a
Change of Control Repurchase Event or require the repayment or repurchase of such Indebtedness upon a Change of
Control Repurchase Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase
the Notes could cause a default under the Existing Credit Facility and/or such Indebtedness, even if the Change of
Control Repurchase Event itself does not. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following
the occurrence of a Change of Control Repurchase Event may be limited by their then-existing financial resources.
There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases
and there can be no assurance that the Issuer would be able to obtain financing to make such repurchases. The
Issuer’s failure to purchase the Notes in connection with a Change of Control Repurchase Event would result in a
Default under the Indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default under such other Indebtedness.

The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of
Control Repurchase Event may deter a third party from acquiring Parent or the Issuer in a transaction that constitutes
a Change of Control Repurchase Event. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the
transfer of “all or substantially all” of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a Holder of Notes to require the
Issuer to repurchase its Notes as a result of a transfer of less than all of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole to another Person may be uncertain.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture:

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Indenture will provide that Parent will not, nor will it permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
create, incur or assume any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any Principal Property or upon the Capital Stock
or Indebtedness of any of its Principal Property Subsidiaries, in each case to secure Indebtedness of Parent, any
Subsidiary of Parent or any other Person, without securing the Notes (together with, at the option of Parent, any
other Indebtedness of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent ranking equally in right of payment with the Notes) equally
and ratably with or, at the option of Parent, prior to, such other Indebtedness for so long as such other Indebtedness
is so secured. Any Lien that is granted to secure the Notes under this covenant shall be automatically released and
discharged at the same time as the release of the Lien that gave rise to the obligation to secure the Notes under this
covenant.

“Permitted Liens” means

(1) Liens securing Indebtedness on any Principal Property existing at the time of its acquisition and Liens

created contemporaneously with or within 360 days after (or created pursuant to firm commitment
financing arrangements obtained within that period) the later of (a) the acquisition or completion of
construction or completion of substantial reconstruction, renovation, remodeling, expansion or
improvement (each, a “substantial improvement”) of such Principal Property or (b) the placing in operation
of such Principal Property after the acquisition or completion of any such construction or substantial
improvement;

(2) Liens on property or assets or shares of Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person existing at the time it is

merged, combined or amalgamated with or into or consolidated with, or its assets or Capital Stock are
acquired by, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or it otherwise becomes a Subsidiary of Parent, provided,
_however, that in each case (a) the Indebtedness secured by such Lien was not incurred in contemplation of_
such merger, combination, amalgamation, consolidation, acquisition or transaction in which Person


-----

becomes a Subsidiary of Parent and (b) such Lien extends only to the Capital Stock and assets of such
Person (and Subsidiaries of such Person) and/or to property other than Principal Property or the Capital
Stock or Indebtedness of any Subsidiary of Parent;

(3) Liens securing Indebtedness in favor of Parent and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries;

(4) Liens in favor of or required by a governmental unit in any relevant jurisdiction, including any departments

or instrumentality thereof, to secure payments under any contract or statute, or to secure debts incurred in
financing the acquisition or construction of or improvements or alterations to property subject thereto;

(5) Liens in favor of any customer arising in respect of and not exceeding the amount of performance deposits

and partial, progress, advance or other payments by that customer for goods produced or services rendered
to that customer in the ordinary course of business and consignment arrangements (whether as consignor or
as consignee) or similar arrangements for the sale or purchase of goods in the ordinary course of business;

(6) Liens existing on the date of the Indenture;

(7) Liens to secure any extension, renewal, refinancing, refunding or replacement (or successive extensions,

renewals, refinancings, refundings or replacements), in whole or in part, of any Indebtedness secured by
Liens referred to in clauses (1) through (6) above or clauses (10) or (12) below or Liens created in
connection with any amendment, consent or waiver relating to such Indebtedness, so long as (a) such Lien
is limited to (i) all or part of substantially the same property which secured the Lien extended, renewed,
refinanced, refunded or replaced and/or (ii) property other than Principal Property or the Capital Stock or
Indebtedness of any Principal Property Subsidiary of Parent and (b) the amount of Indebtedness secured is
not increased (other than by the amount equal to any costs, expenses, premiums, fees or prepayment
penalties incurred in connection with any extension, renewal, refinancing, refunding or replacement);

(8) Liens in respect of cash in connection with the operation of cash management programs and Liens

associated with the discounting or sale of letters of credit and customary rights of set off, banker’s Lien,
revocation, refund or chargeback or similar rights under deposit disbursement, concentration account
agreements or under the Uniform Commercial Code or arising by operation of law;

(9) Liens resulting from the deposit of funds or evidences of Indebtedness in trust for the purpose of defeasing

Indebtedness of Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, and legal or equitable encumbrances deemed to
exist by reason of negative pledges;

(10) Liens securing Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed, as of the date of such

Indebtedness is incurred, the amount that would cause the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio of Parent
to be greater than 3.00 to 1.00 as of such date of incurrence;

(11) Liens on or sales of receivables;

(12) other Liens, in addition to those permitted in clauses (1) through (11) above, securing Indebtedness having

an aggregate principal amount (including all outstanding Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (7)
above to extend, renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant
to this clause (12)), measured as of the date of the incurrence of any such Indebtedness (after giving pro
_forma effect to the application of the proceeds therefrom), taken together with the amount of all_
Attributable Debt of Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries at that time outstanding relating to Sale and
Leaseback Transactions permitted under the covenant described below under the caption “—Limitation on
Sale and Leaseback Transactions,” not to exceed 15% of the Consolidated Net Tangible Assets of Parent
measured as of the date any such Indebtedness is incurred (after giving pro forma effect to the application
of the proceeds therefrom and any transaction in connection with which such Indebtedness is being
incurred);

(13) landlords’, carriers’, warehousemen’s, mechanics’, suppliers’, materialmen’s or other like Liens, in any

case incurred in the ordinary course of business with respect to amounts (a) not yet delinquent or (b) being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings promptly instituted and diligently conducted;

(14) Liens for taxes, assessments or governmental charges or claims or other like statutory Liens, that (a) are not

yet delinquent or (b) are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings promptly instituted and
diligently concluded; provided that any reserve or other appropriate provision as shall be required in
conformity with GAAP shall have been made therefor;


-----

(15) (a) Liens in the form of zoning restrictions, easements, licenses, reservations, covenants, conditions or other

restrictions on the use of real property or other minor irregularities in title (including leasehold title) that do
not (i) secure Indebtedness or (ii) in the aggregate materially impair the value or marketability of the real
property affected thereby or the occupation, use and enjoyment in the ordinary course of business of Parent
and the Restricted Subsidiaries at such real property and (b) with respect to leasehold interests in real
property, mortgages, obligations, liens and other encumbrances incurred, created, assumed or permitted to
exist and arising by, through or under a landlord or owner of such leased property encumbering the
landlord’s or owner’s interest in such leased property;

(16) Liens in the form of pledges or deposits securing bids, tenders, contracts (other than contracts for the

payment of Indebtedness) or leases, warranties, statutory or regulatory obligations or self-insurance
arrangements arising in the ordinary course of business, bankers’ acceptances, surety and appeal bonds,
performance bonds and other obligations of a similar nature to which Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary is
a party, in each case, made in the ordinary course of business;

(17) Liens securing Hedging Obligations not entered into for speculative purposes or securing letters of credit

that support such Hedging Obligations; and

(18) Liens resulting from operation of law with respect to any judgments, awards or orders to the extent that

such judgments, awards or orders do not cause or constitute a Default under the Indenture.

For purposes of clauses (10) and (12) above, (a) with respect to any revolving credit facility secured by a
Lien, the full amount of Indebtedness that may be borrowed thereunder will deemed to be incurred at the time any
revolving credit commitment thereunder is first extended or increased and will not be deemed to be incurred when
such revolving credit facility is drawn upon and (b) if a Lien by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is
granted to secure Indebtedness that was previously unsecured, such Indebtedness will be deemed to be incurred as of
the date such Indebtedness is secured.

**_Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions_**

The Indenture will provide that Parent will not, nor will it permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, enter
into any arrangement with any other Person pursuant to which Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries leases any
Principal Property that has been or is to be sold or transferred by Parent or the Restricted Subsidiary to such other
Person (a “Sale and Leaseback Transaction”), except that a Sale and Leaseback Transaction is permitted if

Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to incur Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the
Principal Property to be leased, without equally and ratably securing the Notes, in an aggregate principal amount
equal to the Attributable Debt with respect to such Sale and Leaseback Transaction.

In addition, the following Sale and Leaseback Transactions are not subject to the limitation above and the
provisions described in “—Limitation on Liens” above:

(1) temporary leases for a term, including renewals at the option of the lessee, of not more than three years;

(2) leases between only Parent and a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent or only between Restricted Subsidiaries of

Parent;

(3) leases where the proceeds from the sale of the subject property are at least equal to the fair market value (as

determined in good faith by Parent) of the subject property and Parent applies an amount equal to the net
proceeds of the sale to the retirement of long-term Indebtedness or the purchase, construction,
development, expansion or improvement of other property or equipment used or useful in its business,
within 270 days of the effective date of such sale; provided that in lieu of applying such amount to the
retirement of long-term Indebtedness, Parent may deliver Notes to the trustee for cancellation; and

(4) leases of property executed by the time of, or within 360 days after the latest of, the acquisition, the

completion of construction, development, expansion or improvement, or the commencement of commercial
operation, of the subject property.


-----

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_**

The Indenture will provide that (i) neither Parent nor any Issuer will consolidate or merge with or into any
other Person or Transfer all or substantially all of the properties or assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole and (ii) neither Parent nor any Issuer will permit any of its Subsidiaries to, in a single transaction or a series of
related transactions, Transfer all or substantially all of the properties or assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, in each case, to, another Person unless:

(1)(a) in the case of a merger, consolidation or Transfer involving Parent, Parent is the surviving
corporation or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than Parent) or to which
such Transfer has been made is a corporation organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any State
thereof or the District of Columbia, and

(b) in the case of a merger, consolidation or Transfer involving an Issuer, such Issuer is the surviving
Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than such Issuer) or to which
such Transfer has been made is a limited liability company, partnership or corporation organized or existing under
the laws of the United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia;

(2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than Parent or an
Issuer, as the case may be) or the Person to which such Transfer has been made assumes all the obligations of
Parent, such Issuer or such Subsidiary under the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Indenture and the Registration
Rights Agreement pursuant to a supplemental indenture or amendment of the relevant documents; and

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the following shall be permitted:

    - the consolidation or merger of Parent with or into or the Transfer of all or substantially all of the
property or assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to Crown, other than any such
merger or consolidation or Transfer to a Subsidiary of Crown;

    - the Transfer of all or substantially all of the property or assets of Crown and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, to Crown, other than any Transfer to a Subsidiary of Crown; and

    - the consolidation or merger of an Issuer with or into or the Transfer of all or substantially all of the
property or assets of such Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to Crown, other than any such
consolidation or merger with or into or Transfer to a Subsidiary of Crown.

The foregoing will not prohibit:

    - a consolidation or merger between an Issuer and a Guarantor other than Crown;

    - a consolidation or merger between a Guarantor and any other Guarantor other than Crown;

    - a consolidation or merger between a Subsidiary (other than an Issuer) that is not a Guarantor and any
other Subsidiary other than Crown;

    - a consolidation or merger of Parent with or into an Affiliate for the purposes of reincorporating Parent
in another jurisdiction;

    - the Transfer of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of a Guarantor to an Issuer and/or any
other Guarantor other than Crown; or

    - the Transfer of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of a Subsidiary (other than an Issuer)
that is not a Guarantor to any other Subsidiary other than Crown;

_provided that, in each case involving an Issuer or a Guarantor, if such Issuer or such Guarantor_
is not the surviving entity of such transaction or the Person to which such Transfer is made, the
surviving entity or the Person to which such Transfer is made shall comply with clause (2)
above.


-----

Upon any consolidation, combination or merger of Parent, an Issuer or any other Guarantor, or any
Transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Parent or an Issuer in accordance with the foregoing, in which
Parent, such Issuer or such Guarantor is not the continuing obligor under the Notes or its related Note Guarantee, the
surviving entity formed by such consolidation or into which Parent, such Issuer or such Guarantor is merged or to
which the Transfer is made will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of
Parent, such Issuer or such Guarantor under the Indenture, Notes and Note Guarantees with the same effect as if
such surviving entity had been named therein as Parent, such Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, and,
except in the case of a Transfer to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent, such Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case
may be, will be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on such Notes or in respect of its
related Note Guarantee, as the case may be, and all of Parent’s, such Issuer or such Guarantor’s, as the case may be,
other obligations and covenants under such Notes, the Indenture and its related Note Guarantee, if applicable.

**_Additional Note Guarantees_**

The Indenture will provide that if Parent acquires or creates a Domestic Subsidiary after the date of the
Indenture and such newly acquired or created Domestic Subsidiary is an obligor or guarantor under any Credit
Facility including, without limitation, the Existing Credit Facility then such newly acquired or created Domestic
Subsidiary must execute a Note Guarantee (and with such documentation relating thereto as are required under the
Indenture, including, without limitation, a supplement or amendment to the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel as
to the enforceability of such Note Guarantee), pursuant to which such Domestic Subsidiary will become a
Guarantor.

As of the date of issuance of the Notes, the Domestic Subsidiaries Crownway Insurance Company, Crown
Cork & Seal Receivables (DE) Corporation, Crown Cork and Seal Receivables II LLC, Crown Receivables III LLC,
Crown Americas Capital Corp., Crown Americas Capital Corp. II, Crown Americas Capital Corp. III, Crown
Americas Capital Corp. IV, Crown Americas Capital Corp. V and Crown Americans Capital Corp. VI will not
Guarantee the Notes.

A Note Guarantee of any Guarantor will be subject to release and discharge as described under the caption
“—Ranking and Guarantees.”

**_Reports_**

The Indenture will provide that, whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), so long as any Notes are outstanding thereunder, the Issuer will furnish to the
Trustee and Holders the following:

(1) all quarterly and annual financial information of Parent that would be required to be contained in a filing

with the SEC on Forms 10-Q and 10-K if Parent were required to file such Forms, including a
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” that describes
the financial condition and results of operations of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries and, with
respect to the annual information only, a report thereon by Parent’s certified independent accountants; and

(2) all current reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K if Parent were required to

file such reports,

in each case, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations. The Issuer may satisfy its
obligation to deliver the information and reports referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above by filing the same with the
SEC.

In addition, whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the SEC, Parent will file a copy of all
such information and reports with the SEC for public availability within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and regulations (unless the SEC will not accept such a filing) and make such information available to securities
analysts and prospective investors upon request. In addition, the Issuer and the Guarantors will, for so long as any
Notes remain outstanding, furnish to the Holders of such Notes and to securities analysts and prospective investors,
upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.


-----

Delivery of such reports and information to the Trustee shall be for informational purposes only, and the
Trustee’s receipt of them shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or
determinable from information contained therein (including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under
the Indenture as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on an Officer’s Certificate).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of Parent or of any Subsidiary of Parent, as
such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the
Note Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each
Holder of Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver may not be effective to waive
liabilities under the federal securities laws.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

The Indenture provides that each of the following constitutes an “Event of Default”:

(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest with respect to the Notes issued thereunder;

(2) default in payment when due of principal or premium, if any, on the Notes issued thereunder at maturity,

upon redemption or otherwise;

(3) failure by Parent or any Subsidiary for 30 days after receipt of notice from the Trustee or Holders of at least

25% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding under the Indenture to comply with the provisions
described under “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control Repurchase Events”;

(4) failure by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent for 60 days after receipt of notice from the Trustee or the

Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding under the Indenture to comply
with any covenant or agreement contained in the Indenture (other than the covenants and agreements
specified in clauses (1) through (3) of this paragraph);

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there

may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (or the payment of
which is Guaranteed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries), whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now
exists or is created after the Issue Date, which default (a) is caused by a failure to pay when due at final
stated maturity (giving effect to any grace period related thereto) principal of such Indebtedness (a
“Payment Default”) or (b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated maturity, and,
in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any such
Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates $75.0 million or more; and, in each case, Parent has received notice specifying the
default from the Trustee or Holders of at least 25% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then
outstanding and does not cure the default within 30 days;

(6) failure by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to pay final judgments (net of any amounts covered by insurance

and as to which such insurer has not denied responsibility or coverage in writing) aggregating $75.0 million
or more, which judgments are not paid, discharged, bonded or stayed within 60 days after their entry;

(7) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to Parent, an Issuer or any other Subsidiary of

Parent that is a Significant Subsidiary or group of Subsidiaries of Parent that, together, would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary; and

(8) any Note Guarantee of any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect

(other than in accordance with the terms of such Note Guarantee and the Indenture) or is declared null and
void and unenforceable or found to be invalid or any Guarantor denies its liability under its Note Guarantee
(other than by reason of release of a Guarantor from its Note Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture and such Note Guarantee).

If any Event of Default under the Indenture occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least
25% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding under the Indenture may declare all Notes issued under the
Indenture to be due and payable by notice in writing to the Issuer and the Trustee, in the case of notice by Holders,
specifying the respective Event of Default and that it is a “notice of acceleration” and the same shall become


-----

immediately due and payable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause
(7) above with respect to Parent or an Issuer, all outstanding Notes then outstanding under the Indenture will become
due and payable without further action or notice. The Holders of any Notes may not enforce the Indenture relating to
the Notes or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to certain limitations, the Holders of a majority
in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes issued under the Indenture may direct the Trustee in its exercise of
any trust or power.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding under the Indenture,
by written notice to the Trustee, may (subject to certain conditions) on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes
issued under the Indenture waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture,
except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or premium on, or principal of, such
Notes. The Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a
Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is
in the Holders’ interest.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the
Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within five business days after an executive officer of an Issuer becomes aware
of any Default or Event of Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will, subject to certain surviving provisions, cease to be of further
effect as to all Notes issued thereunder when:

(1) The Issuer delivers to the Trustee all outstanding Notes issued under the Indenture (other than Notes

replaced because of mutilation, loss, destruction or wrongful taking) for cancellation; or

(2) all Notes outstanding under the Indenture (I) have become due and payable, whether at maturity or as a

result of the mailing of a notice of redemption as described above, or (II) will become due and payable
within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year, under arrangements reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the
expense of the Issuer, and the Issuer or any Guarantor irrevocably deposits with the Trustee as trust funds
in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders, cash in U.S. dollars, noncallable U.S. government securities, or
a combination thereof, sufficient to pay at maturity or upon redemption all Notes outstanding under the
Indenture, including interest thereon,

and if in either case the Issuer or any Guarantor pays all other sums payable under the Indenture by it. The Trustee
will acknowledge satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture on demand of the Issuer accompanied by an officers’
certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, upon which the Trustee shall have no liability in relying, stating that all
conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied and at the cost and expense of the Issuer.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The Issuer may, at their option and at any time, elect to have all of their obligations and the obligations of
the Guarantors discharged with respect to the Notes outstanding under the Indenture (“Legal Defeasance”), except
for:

(1) the rights of the Holders of the Notes outstanding under the Indenture to receive payments in respect of the

principal amount of, premium, if any, and interest on such Notes when such payments are due from the
trust referred to below;

(2) the Issuer obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes,

money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s obligations in connection

therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.


-----

In addition, the Issuer may, at their option and at any time, elect to have all of their obligations and the
obligations of the Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the Indenture
(“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default
or Event of Default under the Indenture. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs under the Indenture, certain
events (not including non-payment, bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events) described under
the caption “—Events of Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance under the Indenture:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes

issued under the Indenture, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable U.S. government securities, or a combination
thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent
public accountants (such opinion shall be delivered to the Trustee and upon which the Trustee shall have no
liability in relying), to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes outstanding under the
Indenture on the stated maturity or on the applicable optional redemption date, as the case may be, and the
Issuer must specify whether such Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the

United States (upon which the Trustee shall have no liability in relying) confirming that (a) the Issuer has
received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the date of
the Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law, in either case to the effect
that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the beneficial owners of the Notes
outstanding under the Indenture will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as
a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the
same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not
occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in

the United States (upon which the Trustee shall have no liability in relying) confirming that the beneficial
owners of the Notes outstanding under the Indenture will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal
income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on
the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant
Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit (other

than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit) or
insofar as Events of Default from bankruptcy or insolvency events are concerned, at any time in the period
ending on the 91st day after the date of deposit;

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a

default under any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is bound;

(6) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel (upon which the Trustee shall have no

liability in relying) to the effect that assuming no intervening bankruptcy of an Issuer or any Guarantor
between the date of deposit and the 91st day following the deposit and assuming that no Holder is an
“insider” of either Issuer under applicable bankruptcy law, after the 91st day following the deposit, the trust
funds will not be subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar
laws affecting creditors’ rights generally;

(7) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an officers’ certificate (upon which the Trustee shall have no liability

in relying) stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the Holders of
Notes issued under the Indenture over the other creditors of an Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of an Issuer or others; and

(8) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an officers’ certificate and an Opinion of Counsel upon which the

Trustee shall have no liability in relying, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for relating to
the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder of Notes may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The
registrar and Trustee may require a Holder of Notes, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and
transfer documents and the applicable Issuer or the Trustee may require a Holder of Notes to pay any taxes and fees
required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any Note selected
for redemption. Also, the Issuer is not required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before a
selection of Notes to be redeemed.

thereby or any Note Guarantee issued thereunder may be amended with the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes issued under the Indenture voting as a single class
(including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, tender offer or exchange offer for
Notes), and any existing default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes governed thereby or

issued under the Indenture affected thereby, however, an amendment or waiver may not (with respect to any Note
held by a non-consenting Holder):

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes issued under the Indenture whose Holders must consent to an

amendment, supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal amount of or change the fixed maturity of any Notes, or alter the provisions with

respect to the redemption of any such Notes other than, except as set forth in clause (7) below, the
provisions relating to the covenant described under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders”;
_provided that the notice period for redemption of the Notes may be reduced to not less than three (3)_
Business Days with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes if a notice of redemption which remains outstanding has not prior thereto been sent to
such Holders;

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any such Notes;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any

such Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes issued under the Indenture and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration);

(5) make any such Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Note;

(6) make any change to the provisions of the Indenture relating to waiver of past Defaults or the rights of

Holders of the Notes issued thereunder to receive payments of principal of or interest on the Notes;

(7) after the Issuer’s obligation to purchase Notes arises thereunder, amend, change or modify in any material

respect the obligations of the Issuer to make and consummate a Change of Control Offer with respect to a
Change of Control Repurchase Event that has occurred, including, without limitation, in each case, by
amending, changing or modifying any of the definitions relating thereto;

(8) release Parent, Crown or any other Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary from any of its obligations

under its Note Guarantee or the Indenture otherwise than in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; or

(9) modify or change any provision of the Indenture affecting the ranking of the Notes or Note Guarantees

issued thereunder in a manner adverse to the Holders of Notes issued thereunder.


-----

Without the consent of any Holder of Notes, the Issuer and the Trustee may amend the Indenture, the Notes
governed thereby or the Note Guarantees issued thereunder:

    - to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

    - to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

    - to provide for the assumption of an Issuer or any Guarantor’s obligations to the Holders of such Notes
in the case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of such Issuer’s or such
Guarantor’s assets;

    - to secure the Notes;

    - to conform the text of the Indenture, Note Guarantees or the Notes to any provision of this
“Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was
intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, Note Guarantees or the Notes;

    - to add any Guarantor or release any Guarantor from its Note Guarantee if such release is in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture;

    - to add to the covenants of the Issuer and the Guarantors for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes or
to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer and the Guarantors;

    - to provide for or confirm the issuance of Additional Notes;

    - to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders of such Notes
or that does not adversely affect the rights under the Indenture of any Holder thereunder in any
material respect; or

    - to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture
under the Trust Indenture Act.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment or waiver. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment
or waiver.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should the Trustee in its capacity
as Trustee become a creditor of an Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain assets
received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee in its individual capacity is permitted to
engage in other transactions with the Issuer; however, if the Trustee acquires any conflicting interest as defined
under the Trust Indenture Act, it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to
continue as Trustee or resign.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes under the Indenture have the
right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the
Trustee under the Indenture, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that in case an Event of
Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge (as provided in the Indenture) shall occur
under the Indenture (which shall not be cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power as provided
in the Indenture, to use the degree of care of a prudent person under the circumstances in the conduct of such
person’s own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights
or powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder of Notes issued thereunder, unless such Holder shall have
offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. The Trustee’s
fees, expenses and indemnities are included in the amounts guaranteed by the Note Guarantees.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of New York.

value at such Make-Whole Redemption Date of the sum of the principal amount that would be payable on such Note
on      , 2030 and all remaining interest payments to and including      , 2030 (but excluding any interest
accrued to the Make-Whole Redemption Date), discounted on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year

selected by Parent as a replacement agency for Moody’s or S&P, or both, as the case may be.

“Rating Date” means the date that is 60 days prior to the earlier of (a) a Change of Control or (b) public

**Certain Bankruptcy and Fraudulent Transfer Limitations**

Fraudulent transfer, insolvency and administrative laws may void, subordinate or limit the Notes and Note
Guarantees and may otherwise limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

Under U.S. federal bankruptcy laws or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, the issuance
of the Guarantees by Parent and the Guarantors could be voided, or claims in respect of such obligations could be
subordinated to all of their other debts and other liabilities, if, among other things, at the time Parent and/or the
Guarantors issued the related Guarantees, Parent or the applicable Guarantor intended to hinder, delay or defraud
any present or future creditor; or received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the
incurrence of such indebtedness and either:

    - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

    - was engaged in a business or transaction for which Parent’s or such Guarantor’s remaining assets
constituted unreasonably small capital; or

    - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they
mature.

    - The measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the


-----

law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, Parent or a Guarantor
would be considered insolvent if:

    - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the saleable value of all of its
assets;

    - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liabilities on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and
mature; or

    - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

By its terms, the Guarantee of each Guarantor will limit the liability of each such Guarantor to the
maximum amount it can pay without the Guarantee being deemed a fraudulent transfer. Parent believes that
immediately after the issuance of the Notes by the Issuer and the issuance of the Guarantees by the Guarantors,
Parent and each of the Guarantors will be solvent, will have sufficient capital to carry on its respective business and
will be able to pay its respective debts as they mature. However, a court may not apply these standards in making its
determinations and a court may not reach the same conclusions with regard to these issues. In an evidentiary ruling
in In re W.R. Grace & Co., the federal bankruptcy court for the District of Delaware held that under the Uniform
Fraudulent Transfer Act, whether a transferor is insolvent or is rendered insolvent depends on the actual liabilities of
the transferor, and not what the transferor knows about such liabilities at the time of the transfer. Therefore, under
that court’s analysis, liabilities that are unknown, or that are known to exist but whose magnitude is not fully
appreciated at the time of the transfer, may be taken into account in the context of a future determination of
insolvency. If the principle articulated by that court is upheld, it would make it very difficult to know whether a
transferor is solvent at the time of transfer, and would increase the risk that a transfer may in the future be found to
be a fraudulent conveyance.

If a bankruptcy proceeding were to be commenced under the federal bankruptcy laws by or against Parent
or any other Guarantor, it is likely that delays will occur in any payment upon acceleration of the Notes and in
enforcing remedies under the applicable Indenture, because of specific provisions of such laws or by a court
applying general principles of equity. Provisions under federal bankruptcy laws or general principles of equity that
could result in the impairment of your rights include, but are not limited to:

    - the automatic stay;

    - avoidance of preferential transfers by a trustee or debtor-in-possession;

    - substantive consolidation;

    - limitations on collectibility of unmatured interest or attorney fees;

    - fraudulent conveyance; and

    - forced restructuring of the Notes, including reduction of principal amounts and interest rates and
extension of maturity dates, over the holders’ objections.

**Book-Entry; Delivery and Form**

The certificates representing the Notes will be issued in fully registered form without interest coupons.

Notes sold in reliance on Rule 144A will initially be represented by permanent global Notes in fully
registered form without interest coupons (each, a “Restricted Global Note”) and will be deposited with the Trustee
as a custodian for The Depositary Trust Company (“DTC”) and registered in the name of a nominee of such
depositary.

Notes sold in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be
represented by temporary global Notes in fully registered form without interest coupons (each, a “Temporary
_Regulation S Global Note”) and will be deposited with the Trustee as custodian for DTC, as depositary, and_
registered in the name of a nominee of such depositary. Each Temporary Regulation S Global Note will be
exchangeable for a single permanent global Note after the expiration of the “distribution compliance period” (as


-----

defined in Regulation S) and the certification required by Regulation S. Prior to such time, a beneficial interest in the
Temporary Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in
the Restricted Global Note only upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification from the transferor to the effect
that such transfer is being made to a person whom the transferor reasonably believes is a QIB in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A. Beneficial interests in a Restricted Global Note may be transferred to a
person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Regulation S Global Note whether before, on or after such
time, only upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S.

Any beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Note or a Restricted Global Note (each, a “Global Note”)
that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Restricted Global Note or a
Regulation S Global Note, respectively, will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in the type of Global Note
previously held and become an interest in the other type of Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject
to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other type of Global
Note for as long as it remains such an interest.

The Global Notes (and any Notes issued in exchange therefor) will be subject to certain restrictions on
transfer set forth therein and in the Indenture and will bear the legend regarding such restrictions set forth under the
heading “Notice to Investors” herein. Subject to such restrictions, QIBs or non-U.S. purchasers may elect to take
physical delivery of their certificates (each, a “Certificated Security”) instead of holding their interests through the
Global Notes (and which are then ineligible to trade through DTC) (collectively referred to herein as the “Non_Global Purchasers”). Upon the transfer to a QIB of any Certificated Security initially issued to a Non- Global_
Purchaser, such Certificated Security will, unless the transferee requests otherwise or the Global Notes have
previously been exchanged in whole for Certificated Securities, be exchanged for an interest in the Global Notes.
For a description of the restrictions on transfer of Certificated Securities and any interest in the Global Notes, see
“Notice to Investors.”

**_The Global Notes_**

We expect that pursuant to procedures established by DTC (i) upon the issuance of the Global Notes, DTC
or its custodian will credit, on its internal system, the principal amount at maturity of the individual beneficial
interests represented by such Global Notes to the respective accounts of persons who have accounts with such
depositary and (ii) ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of such
ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC or its nominee (with respect to interests of
participants) and the records of participants (with respect to interests of persons other than participants). Such
accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the initial purchasers and ownership of beneficial interests in
the Global Notes will be limited to persons who have accounts with DTC (“participants”) or persons who hold
interests through participants. Holders may hold their interests in the Global Notes directly through DTC if they are
participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations which are participants in such system.

So long as DTC, or its nominee, is the registered owner or holder of the Notes, DTC or such nominee, as
the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the Notes represented by such Global Notes for all
purposes under the Indenture. No beneficial owner of an interest in the Global Notes will be able to transfer that
interest except in accordance with DTC’s procedures, in addition to those provided for under the Indenture with
respect to the Notes.

Payments of the principal of, premium (if any), interest (including Additional Interest (as defined in the
Registration Rights Agreement)) on, the Global Notes will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as
the registered owner thereof. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any Paying Agent will have any responsibility or
liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in
the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership
interest.

The Issuer expects that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal, premium, if any,
interest (including Additional Interest) on the Global Notes, will credit participants’ accounts with payments in
amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the Global Notes as shown


-----

on the records of DTC or its nominee. The Issuer also expects that payments by participants to owners of beneficial
interests in the Global Notes held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary
practice, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees
for such customers. Such payments will be the responsibility of such participants.

Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way through DTC’s same-day funds
system in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same day funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of
a Certificated Security for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states which require physical delivery of
the Notes, or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in a Global Note, in accordance with the
normal procedures of DTC and with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

DTC has advised the Issuer that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes (including
the presentation of Notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to
whose account the DTC interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the
aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction.
However, if there is an Event of Default under the Indenture, DTC will exchange the Global Notes for Certificated
Securities, which it will distribute to its participants and which will include the legend as set forth under the heading
“Notice to Investors.”

DTC has advised the Issuer as follows: DTC is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws
of the State of New York, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of
the Uniform Commercial Code and a “Clearing Agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the
Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and facilitate the clearance and settlement of
securities transactions between participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its participants,
thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Participants include securities brokers and
dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Indirect access to the DTC
system is available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a
custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly (“indirect participants”).

Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the
Global Note among participants of DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures
may be discontinued at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will have any responsibility for the performance
by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

**_Certificated Securities_**

Certificated Securities shall be issued in exchange for beneficial interests in the Global Notes (i) if
requested by a holder of such interests or (ii) if DTC is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as a depositary
for the Global Notes and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 90 days.

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

This section describes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing
of the notes. It applies only to notes acquired in this offering at the offering price and held as capital assets for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. This section does not apply to you if you are a member of a class of holders subject to
special rules, such as:

    - a dealer in securities or currencies,

    - a trader in securities that elects to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities
holdings,

    - a bank or other financial institution,

    - a regulated investment company,

    - a life insurance company,

    - a tax-exempt entity,

    - a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and
investors therein),

    - an expatriate,

    - a person that owns notes that are a hedge or that are hedged against interest rate risks,

    - a person that owns notes as part of a straddle or conversion transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes,

    - a person subject to the alternative minimum tax,

    - a person required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the notes as
a result of such income being taken into account on an applicable financial statement,

    - a U.S. holder (as defined below) that holds notes through a non-U.S. broker or other non-U.S.
intermediary, or

    - a U.S. holder whose functional currency for tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar.

***************************

**YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX**
**CONSEQUENCES TO YOU ARISING FROM YOUR PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION**
**OF A NOTE, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL ESTATE OR GIFT TAX**
**LAWS, ANY U.S. STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS AND ANY PROPOSED CHANGES IN**
**APPLICABLE TAX LAWS.**

***************************

This section (i) does not address U.S. federal tax consequences other than income tax consequences, such
as estate and gift tax consequences and alternative minimum tax consequences, (ii) does not deal with all tax
considerations that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s personal circumstances, and (iii) does not
address any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences.

This section is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), its
legislative history, existing and proposed regulations under the Internal Revenue Code, published rulings and court
decisions, all as currently in effect, all of which are subject to change, or differing interpretations, possibly on a
retroactive basis. Crown Americas is not seeking a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding
the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the notes. Accordingly, there can be no assurance
that the IRS will not successfully challenge one or more of the conclusions stated herein.


-----

If an entity taxable as a partnership holds the notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership
generally will depend on the status of the particular partner and the activities of the partnership. Partners of
partnerships considering an investment in the notes should consult their own tax advisors as to the specific tax
consequences to them of holding the notes indirectly through ownership of their partnership interests.

**Payments Subject to Certain Contingencies**

In certain circumstances, Crown Americas may be obligated to pay holders amounts in excess of the stated
interest and principal payable on the notes or in advance of their scheduled payment dates. The obligation to make
such payments may implicate the provisions of U.S. Treasury Regulations relating to “contingent payment debt
instruments.” If the notes were deemed to be contingent payment debt instruments, holders might, among other
things, be required to treat any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of a note as ordinary income rather
than as capital gain, and the timing and amount of income inclusion may be different from the consequences
discussed herein. Crown Americas intends to take the position that the likelihood that such payments will be made is
remote and/or that such payments will be incidental in the aggregate, and therefore the notes are not subject to the
rules governing contingent payment debt instruments.

This determination will be binding on a holder unless such holder explicitly discloses on a statement
attached to such holder’s timely filed U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the acquisition
date of the note that such holder’s determination is different. It is possible, however, that the IRS may take a
contrary position from that described above, in which case the tax consequences to a holder could differ materially
and adversely from those described below. The remainder of this disclosure assumes that the notes will not be
treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**U.S. Holders**

This subsection describes the tax consequences to a U.S. holder. You are a U.S. holder if you are a
beneficial owner of a note and you are for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

    - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States,

    - a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District
of Columbia,

    - an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source, or

    - a trust if (x) a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or
more United States persons (as defined under the Internal Revenue Code) are authorized to control all
substantial decisions of the trust or (y) it has a valid election in effect under the applicable U.S.
Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person.

**_Taxation of Stated Interest_**

You generally will be taxed on payments of stated interest on your note as ordinary income at the time you
receive the interest or when it accrues, depending on your regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

**_Registered Exchange Offer_**

The exchange of notes for identical debt securities registered under the Securities Act will not constitute a
taxable exchange. See “Exchange Offer; Registration Rights” below. As a result,

    - you will not recognize taxable gain or loss as a result of exchanging your notes;

    - your holding period of the exchange notes you receive will include your holding period of the notes
you exchange; and

    - your adjusted tax basis in the exchange notes you receive will be the same as your adjusted tax basis,
immediately before the exchange, in the notes you exchange.


-----

**_Sale, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**

Your tax basis in your note generally will be its cost. You will generally recognize capital gain or loss on
the sale, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of your note equal to the difference between the amount
you realize on such disposition (excluding any amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which will be
taxed as ordinary income to the extent not previously includible in income) and your adjusted tax basis in your note.
Your adjusted tax basis in your note generally will be the amount that you paid for the note. Capital gain of a
noncorporate U.S. holder is generally eligible for reduced tax rates where the property is held for more than one
year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations under the Internal Revenue Code.

**_Additional Tax on Net Investment Income_**

Certain non-corporate U.S. holders are subject to a 3.8% tax, in addition to regular tax on income and
gains, on some or all of their “net investment income,” which generally will include interest on a note and any net
gain recognized upon a disposition of a note. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the
applicability of this tax in respect of their notes.

**Non-U.S. Holders**

You are a non-U.S. holder if you are a beneficial owner of a note that is an individual, corporation, trust or
estate for U.S. federal income tax purposes and you are not a U.S. holder.

**_Taxation of Interest_**

Subject to the discussions below of backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below), if you are a nonU.S. holder of a note and the interest paid on a note is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or
business in the United States, the applicable withholding agent generally will not be required to deduct a U.S.
withholding tax at a 30% rate (or, if applicable, a lower income tax treaty rate) if:

    - you do not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all
classes of stock of Crown Americas entitled to vote,

    - you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to Crown Americas through stock
ownership,

    - you are not a bank receiving the interest pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in your ordinary
course of business, and

    - you have furnished to such agent an IRS Form W-8BEN, an IRS Form W-8BEN-E or an acceptable
substitute form upon which you certify, under penalties of perjury, that you are a non-United States
person.

Except to the extent that an applicable income tax treaty otherwise provides, you generally will be taxed in
the same manner as a U.S. holder with respect to interest if such interest income is effectively connected with your
conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Effectively connected interest of a corporate non-U.S. holder
may also, in some circumstances, be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate (or, if applicable, a
lower income tax treaty rate). Even though such effectively connected interest may be subject to income tax, and
may be subject to the branch profits tax, it is not subject to withholding tax (whether or not it is subject to income
tax) if the non-U.S. holder delivers a properly executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI to the applicable
withholding agent.

**_Sale, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**

If you are a non-U.S. holder of a note, you generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or
withholding tax on gain realized on the sale, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note (other than
any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which will be treated as discussed above) unless:

    - the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States, in which
case such gain will be taxable in the same manner as effectively connected interest as discussed above
(except to the extent otherwise provided by an applicable income tax treaty), or


-----

    - you are an individual, you are present in the United States for 183 or more days during the taxable year
in which the gain is realized and certain other conditions exist, in which case you will be subject to a
flat 30% U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized (except to the extent otherwise provided by
an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by certain U.S. losses.

**Backup Withholding and Information Reporting**

**_U.S. Holders_**

Information reporting on IRS Form 1099 will apply to payments of interest on, or the proceeds of the sale,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition (including a redemption or retirement) of, the notes with respect
to certain non-corporate U.S. holders, and backup withholding may apply unless the recipient of such payments has
supplied a taxpayer identification number, certified under penalties of perjury, as well as certain other information or
otherwise established an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against that holder’s
U.S. federal income tax liability provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

Backup withholding and information reporting on IRS Form 1099 will not apply to payments of interest to
a non-U.S. holder provided that the non-U.S. holder is the beneficial owner of the notes and certifies to the
applicable withholding agent, under penalties of perjury, that it is not a United States person and provides its name
and address on a duly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, (or a suitable substitute
form).

Information reporting and backup withholding generally will not apply to a payment of the proceeds of a
sale, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of notes effected outside the United States by a foreign
office of a foreign broker. However, information reporting requirements (but not backup withholding) will apply to
a payment of the proceeds of a sale, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of notes effected outside the
United States by a foreign office of a broker if the broker (i) is a United States person, (ii) derives 50 percent or
more of its gross income for certain periods from the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, (iii) is a
“controlled foreign corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or (iv) is a foreign partnership that, at any
time during its taxable year is 50 percent or more (by income or capital interest) owned by United States persons or
is engaged in the conduct of a U.S. trade or business, unless in any such case the broker has documentary evidence
in its records that the holder is a non-U.S. holder and certain conditions are met, or the holder otherwise establishes
an exemption. Payment of the proceeds of a sale, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of notes by a
United States office of a broker will be subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the
holder certifies its non-U.S. status under penalties of perjury or otherwise establishes an exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
may be allowed as a refund or a credit against that holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act**

Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”), a 30% withholding tax may apply to certain
types of payments made to “foreign financial institutions” (as specially defined in the Code) and certain other nonU.S. entities, including foreign financial institutions and other entities acting as an intermediary. Specifically, a 30%
withholding tax may be imposed on interest on, and gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of, notes paid
to a foreign financial institution or to a non-financial foreign entity, unless (1) the foreign financial institution
undertakes certain diligence and reporting, (2) the non-financial foreign entity either certifies it does not have any
substantial United States owners or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial United States
owner, or (3) the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity otherwise qualifies for an exemption
from these rules. If the payee is a foreign financial institution and is subject to the diligence and reporting
requirements in clause (1) above, then, pursuant to an agreement between it and the U.S. Treasury or an
intergovernmental agreement between, generally, the jurisdiction in which it is resident and the U.S. Treasury, it
must, among other things, identify accounts held by certain United States persons or United States-owned foreign


-----

entities, annually report certain information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on payments to non- compliant
foreign financial institutions and certain other account holders.

The withholding provisions described above generally apply to interest payments on the notes. Although
existing FATCA regulations would also impose FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds from the sale
or disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of the notes, under proposed regulations, no such withholding
would apply to gross proceeds. Taxpayers generally may rely on those proposed regulations until final regulations
are issued. Persons considering an investment in the notes should consult their tax advisors regarding FATCA and
the regulations thereunder.

**EXCHANGE OFFER; REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

The issuer, the guarantors and the initial purchasers will enter into registration rights agreements relating to
the notes on the issue date of the notes. Pursuant to the registration rights agreements, the issuer and the guarantors
will agree, at their cost, for the benefit of the holders of the notes, to:

    - use their reasonable best efforts to file a registration statement with the SEC and cause to become
effective the registration statement with respect to a registered offer to exchange the notes for new
notes of the issuer having terms substantially identical in all material respects to the notes (except that
the exchange notes will not contain terms with respect to transfer restrictions); and

    - use their reasonable best efforts to cause the registered exchange offer to become completed under the
Securities Act within 360 days of the issue date of the notes.

Upon the effectiveness of the exchange offer registration statement, the issuer and the guarantors will offer
the exchange notes in exchange for the surrender of the notes. The issuer and the guarantors will keep the registered
exchange offer open for not less than 20 business days (or longer if required by applicable law) after the date notice
of the registered exchange offer is mailed to the holders and to consummate the registered exchange offer no later
than 35 days (or longer if required by applicable law) after the date notice of the registered exchange offer is mailed
to the holders. For each note surrendered to the issuer pursuant to the registered exchange offer, the holder of such
note will receive an exchange note having a principal amount equal to that of the surrendered note. Interest on each
exchange note will accrue from the last interest payment date on which interest was paid on the note surrendered in
exchange therefor or, if no interest has been paid on such note, from the date of its original issue.

Under existing SEC interpretations, the exchange notes will be freely transferable by holders other than
affiliates of an issuer after the registered exchange offer without further registration under the Securities Act if the
holder of the exchange notes represents that it is acquiring the exchange notes in the ordinary course of its business,
that it has no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution of the exchange notes
and that it is not an affiliate of an issuer, as such terms are interpreted by the SEC; provided that broker-dealers
receiving exchange notes in the registered exchange offer will have a prospectus delivery requirement with respect
to resales of such exchange notes. While the SEC has not taken a position with respect to this particular transaction,
under existing SEC interpretations relating to transactions structured substantially like the registered exchange offer,
participating broker-dealers may fulfill their prospectus delivery requirements with respect to exchange notes (other
than a resale of an unsold allotment of the notes) with the prospectus contained in the exchange offer registration
statement. Under the registration rights agreements, the issuer will be required to allow participating broker-dealers
and other persons, if any, with similar prospectus delivery requirements to use the prospectus contained in the
exchange offer registration statement in connection with the resale of such exchange notes for 180 days following
the effective date of such exchange offer registration statement (or such shorter period during which participating
broker-dealers are required by law to deliver such prospectuses).

A holder of notes (other than certain specified holders) who wishes to exchange such notes for exchange
notes in the registered exchange offer will be required to represent that any exchange notes to be received by it will
be acquired in the ordinary course of its business and that at the time of the commencement of the exchange offer it
has no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) of the exchange notes and that it is not an “affiliate” of an issuer, as defined in Rule 405 of the
Securities Act, or if it is an affiliate of an issuer, that it will comply with the registration and prospectus delivery
requirements of the Securities Act to the extent applicable. If a holder is a broker-dealer that will receive exchange
notes for its own account in exchange for notes that were acquired as a result of market-making or other trading
activities, it will be required to acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such
exchange notes.

In the event that:

    - applicable interpretations of the staff of the SEC do not permit the issuer and the guarantors to effect
such a registered exchange offer; or

    - for any other reason the registered exchange offer is not completed within 360 days after the issue date


-----

of the notes; or

    - prior to the 20th day following consummation of the registered exchange offer:

    - any initial purchaser so requests with respect to notes not eligible to be exchanged for exchange notes
in the registered exchange offer;

    - any holder of notes notifies the issuer that it is not eligible to participate in the registered exchange
offer; or

    - an initial purchaser notifies the issuer that it will not receive freely tradable exchange notes in
exchange for notes constituting any portion of an unsold allotment,

    - the issuer and the guarantors will, subject to certain conditions, at their cost:

    - as promptly as practicable but no later than the deadline provided for in the registration rights
agreements, file a shelf registration statement covering resales of the notes or the exchange notes, as
the case may be;

    - use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the shelf registration statement to be declared
effective under the Securities Act no later than the deadline provided for in the registration rights
agreement; and

    - keep the shelf registration statement effective until the earliest of (1) one year from the effective date
of the shelf registration statement and (2) the date on which all notes registered thereunder are disposed
of in accordance therewith.

The issuer and the guarantors will, in the event a shelf registration statement is filed, among other things,
provide to each holder for whom such shelf registration statement was filed copies of the prospectus which forms a
part of the shelf registration statement, notify each such holder when the shelf registration statement has become
effective and take certain other actions as are required to permit unrestricted resales of the notes or the exchange
notes, as the case may be. A holder selling such notes or exchange notes pursuant to the shelf registration statement
generally would be required to be named as a selling security holder in the related prospectus and to deliver a
prospectus to purchasers, will be subject to certain of the civil liability provisions under the Securities Act in
connection with such sales and will be bound by the provisions of the registration rights agreement which are
applicable to such holder (including certain indemnification obligations).

In the event that:

    - within 360 days after the issue date of the notes, the registered exchange offer has not been completed;

    - if required, the shelf registration statement has not been filed by the deadline provided for in the
registration rights agreement or has not been declared effective by the deadline provided for in the
registration rights agreement; or

    - after the shelf registration statement has been declared effective, such registration statement thereafter
ceases to be effective or usable (subject to certain exceptions) in connection with resales of notes or
exchange notes in accordance with and during the periods specified in the registration rights agreement

(each such event a “registration default”), additional interest will accrue on the notes and the exchange
notes (in addition to the stated interest on the notes and the exchange notes) from and including the date on which
any such registration default has occurred to but excluding the date on which all registration defaults have been
cured. Additional interest will accrue at a rate of 0.25% per annum during the 90-day period immediately following
the occurrence of any registration default and will increase by 0.25% per annum at the end of each subsequent 90day period, but in no event will such rate exceed 1.00% per annum in the aggregate regardless of the number of
registration defaults.

The summary herein of certain provisions of the registration rights agreement does not purport to be
complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all the provisions of the registration rights
agreement, copies of which are available upon request to the initial purchasers.


-----

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

None of the notes have been registered under the Securities Act and they may not be offered or sold within
the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the notes are being
offered and sold only (A) to persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule
144A promulgated under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”)) (“QIBs”) in compliance with Rule 144A and (B) outside
the United States to persons other than U.S. persons (“non-U.S. purchasers”, which term shall include dealers or
other professional fiduciaries in the United States acting on a discretionary basis for non-U.S. beneficial owners
(other than an estate or trust)) in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”). As used
herein, the terms “United States” and “U.S. person” have the meanings given to them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of notes will be deemed to have represented and agreed as follows:

1. It is purchasing the notes for its own account or an account with respect to which it exercises sole
investment discretion and that it and any such account is either (A) a QIB, and is aware that the sale to it is being
made in reliance on Rule 144A and (B) a non-U.S. purchaser that is outside the United States (or a non-U.S.
purchaser that is a dealer or other fiduciary as referred to above).

2. It acknowledges that the notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be
offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except as set forth below.

3. It shall not, on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor for which it has purchased notes, prior
to the date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) that is one year (in the case of notes issued in reliance on
Rule 144A (“Rule 144A notes”)) or 40 days (in the case of notes issued in reliance on Regulation S (“Regulation S
notes”)) (or such shorter period of time as permitted by Rule 144A or Regulation S, as applicable, under the
Securities Act or any successor provision thereunder) after the later of the original issue date of the notes and the last
date on which the issuer or any affiliate of the issuer were the owner of such notes (or any predecessor of such
notes) or, if later, the last date upon which Additional Notes (as defined in the Indenture) have been issued, offer,
resell or otherwise transfer any of such notes except (A) to the issuer or any of their subsidiaries, (B) inside the
United States to a QIB in a transaction complying with Rule 144A, (C) inside the United States to institutional
“accredited investors” (as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities Act) (an “Accredited
Investor”), that, prior to such transfer, furnishes (or has furnished on its behalf by a U.S. broker-dealer) to the
Trustee a signed letter containing certain representations and agreements relating to the restrictions on transfer of the
notes (the form of which letter can be obtained from such Trustee), (D) outside the United States in compliance with
Rule 904 under the Securities Act, (E) pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 under the
Securities Act (if available), (F) in accordance with another exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act (and based upon an opinion of counsel if the issuer so request), or (G) pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act.

4. It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the notes notice of any restrictions on
transfer of such notes.

5. It acknowledges that prior to any proposed transfer of notes in certificated form or of beneficial
interests in a note in global form (a “Global Note”) (in each case other than pursuant to an effective registration
statement) the holder of notes or the holder of beneficial interests in a Global Note, as the case may be, may be
required to provide certifications and other documentation relating to the manner of such transfer and submit such
certifications and other documentation as provided in the Indenture.

6. It understands that all of the notes will bear a legend substantially to the following effect unless
otherwise agreed by the issuer and the holder thereof:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER

TRUSTEE AND THE ISSUER SUCH CERTIFICATIONS, LEGAL OPINIONS OR OTHER INFORMATION AS
EITHER OF THEM MAY REASONABLY REQUIRE TO CONFIRM THAT SUCH TRANSFER IS BEING
MADE PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT. AS USED HEREIN, THE TERMS
“OFFSHORE TRANSACTION,”

“UNITED STATES” AND “U.S. PERSON” HAVE THE MEANING GIVEN TO THEM BY
REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT.

7. Either (i) it is not acquiring or holding such notes with the assets of (A) an “employee benefit

fiduciary in connection with the acquisition and holding of such notes.

8. It acknowledges that the Trustee will not be required to accept for registration of transfer any notes
acquired by it, except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the issuer and the Trustee that the restrictions set
forth herein have been complied with.

9. It acknowledges that the issuer, the initial purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and
accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgments, representations and agreements and agrees that if any of the
acknowledgments, representations or agreements deemed to have been made by its purchase of the notes are no
longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the issuer and the initial purchasers. If it is acquiring the notes as a fiduciary
or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each
such account and it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgments, representations, and agreements on
behalf of each account.

**Notice to prospective investors in the European Economic Area**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,


-----

sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes,
a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97
(as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client
as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any Member State of
the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus
Regulation.

The above selling restriction is in addition to any other selling restrictions set out below.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/565 as
it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); or (ii) a customer
within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended, the “FSMA”)
and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 600/2014 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently
no key information document required by Regulation (EU) 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. This offering
memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in the UK will be made pursuant to an
exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation and the FSMA from the requirement to publish a prospectus for
offers of notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation or
the FSMA.

This document is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating to
investments and who qualify as investment professionals within the meaning of Article 19(5) of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”),
(ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.”)
of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or
inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000, as amended (“FSMA”)) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise
lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant
persons”). This document is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who
are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this document relates is available only to
relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

**Notice to Canadian Investors**

The notes may be sold in Canada only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal
that are accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1)
of the Securities Act (Ontario), and that are permitted clients, as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration
_Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the notes must be made in_


-----

accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable
Canadian securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies
for rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a
misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the
time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should refer
to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of
these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

Pursuant to section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (NI 33-105), the initial
purchasers are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding initial purchaser
conflicts of interest in connection with this offering memorandum.

**New Issue of Notes**

The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to apply for
listing of the notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes on any automated dealer
quotation system. Prior to the offering, there has been no active market for the notes. Certain of the initial purchasers
have advised the issuer that they presently intend to make a market in the notes as permitted by applicable laws and
regulations. The initial purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the notes and any such market
making may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the initial purchasers. Accordingly, no assurance
can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the notes.

**Stabilization and Short Positions**

In connection with the offering, certain persons participating in the offering may engage in transactions that
stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the notes. Specifically, the initial purchasers may bid for and
purchase notes in the open markets to stabilize the price of the notes. The initial purchasers may also overallot the
offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase notes in the open market to cover the
syndicate short position. In addition, the initial purchasers may bid for and purchase notes in market making
transactions and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the
notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The initial purchasers are not required to engage in these
activities, and may end these activities at any time. We and the initial purchasers make no representation as to the
direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In
addition, neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation that anyone will engage in such
transactions or that such transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

**Other Relationships**

The initial purchasers and certain of their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the
initial purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in the
future investment banking, commercial lending and financial advisory services to the issuer and its affiliates in the
ordinary course of business for which they have received, or may in the future receive, compensation. In addition,
certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates are lenders and/or agents under Crown’s senior secured credit
facilities and receive compensation thereunder.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers and their affiliates may
make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our
affiliates. If any of the initial purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us, certain of those initial
purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may


-----

hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, these initial
purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the
purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes
offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the
notes offered hereby. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or
publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

**Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about      , 2022,
which will be the       business day following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement being
referred to as T+ ). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle
in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who
wish to trade notes on the date hereof or the next    succeeding business day will be required, by virtue of the fact
that the notes initially settle in T+ , to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to
prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes on the date hereof or the next
succeeding business day should consult their advisors.


-----
