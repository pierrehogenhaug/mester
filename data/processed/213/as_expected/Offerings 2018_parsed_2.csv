Under IFRS 3, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair value on the date of acquisition and the consideration transferred is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed separately from goodwill.

The valuation studies necessary to finalize the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the related allocation of the consideration transferred have not been completed.

Because of these limitations, Refresco and Cott TB have historically relied and we will rely primarily on IFRS or U.S. GAAP results, as applicable, and have used or will use these measures only supplementally. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA per liter, volume and gross profit margin per liter should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of Refresco’s or Cott TB’s (as applicable) operating performance reported in accordance with IFRS or U.S. GAAP, respectively. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, some of which are as follows: - EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense on Refresco’s or Cott TB’s debt or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on Refresco’s or Cott TB’s debt; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; - EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to Refresco or Cott TB; - EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA per liter and gross profit margin per liter do not reflect all of Refresco’s or Cott TB’s costs and include certain adjustments for certain costs and expenses deemed to be one-off; xiii ----- - other companies in the industry in which we operate may calculate these measures or other similarly titled measures differently than Refresco or Cott TB do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures; and - the calculations and presentations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Synergies Adjusted EBITDA in this offering memorandum are similar to, but different from, the calculation of ‘‘Consolidated EBITDA’’ pursuant to the definition thereof under the Indenture governing the Notes offered hereby and the agreement governing our Senior Credit Facilities. See ‘‘Description of the _Notes—Certain Definitions.’’ Accordingly, EBITDA does not provide precise indications as to the level_ of our adherence to the terms of our Indenture and the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement. You are encouraged to evaluate each of the adjustments reflected in Refresco’s and Cott TB’s presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and whether you consider each to be appropriate. See ‘‘Summary— _Summary Consolidated Financial Information and Other Financial and Operating Data of Refresco’’ and_ ‘‘Summary—Summary Historical Combined Carve-out Financial Information and Other Financial and _Operating Data of Cott TB.’’ Presentation of pro forma EBITDA and pro forma Adjusted EBITDA_ In this offering memorandum, we present _pro forma EBITDA and_ _pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of the Issuer for the year ended December 31, 2017. See ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined _Consolidated Financial Information’’ for a description of the unaudited_ _pro forma adjustments made_ thereto. _Pro forma EBITDA and_ _pro forma Adjusted EBITDA do not purport to indicate our future consolidated results of operations. See ‘‘—Limitations as Analytical Tools’’ for an indication of the limited reliance that should be placed on EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as measures of operating performance. _Presentation of Pro Forma Synergies Adjusted EBITDA_ In this offering memorandum, we present Pro Forma Synergies Adjusted EBITDA of the Issuer for the year ended December 31, 2017 as an additional measure of our operating performance to provide an indicative illustration of how the Cott TB Acquisition and the Transactions, including the realization of anticipated synergies, would have contributed to our results of operations on a combined basis had they occurred on January 1, 2017. The presentation of Pro Forma Synergies Adjusted EBITDA is based upon a number of significant assumptions and estimates, which we believe are reasonable as are further described in ‘‘Summary—Summary Pro Forma and Other Adjusted Financial Information—Other Pro Forma Financial _Data of Refresco.’’ There can be no assurance, however, that we will successfully integrate Cott TB into_ Refresco or that our estimates and assumptions (some of which are forward-looking in nature) are or will prove accurate in all material respects. The Pro Forma Synergies Adjusted EBITDA information presented in this offering memorandum is for informational purposes only and is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of our results of operations for year ended December 31, 2017 as if the Cott TB Acquisition and the Transactions, including the realization of anticipated synergies, had occurred on January 1, 2017, and may not be comparable to the Refresco Financial Statements or the Cott TB Carve-out Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Pro Forma Synergies Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to indicate our future consolidated results of operations.

Refresco uses free cash flow and working capital to monitor cash flow generation. _Cott TB_ Cott TB defines working capital as accounts receivable, plus inventories, plus prepaid, less accountants payable. Cott TB uses working capital to monitor cash flow generation. xiv ----- _Limitations of free cash flow and working capital as analytical tools_ Free cash flow and working capital are not measures of liquidity under IFRS or U.S. GAAP and have limitations as an analytical tool, some of which are as follows: - Free cash flow and working capital do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures by Refresco, since Refresco has debt payment obligations and tax payment obligations that are not deducted from the measure; - free cash flow and working capital do not deduct cash flows used in other financing activities; - free cash flow and working capital do not deduct certain other items settled in cash; and - other companies in the industries in which we operate may calculate free cash flow and working capital, or other similarly titled measures differently than Refresco and Cott TB do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Refresco and Cott TB have historically relied and we will rely primarily on measures of liquidity and cash flows presented in accordance with IFRS or U.S. GAAP, as applicable, and use free cash flow and working capital only supplementally. Free cash flow of Cott TB is not presented in this offering memorandum. Any free cash flow measures presented herein are based on Refresco’s historical financial results only and exclude Cott TB. You are encouraged to evaluate the methodology for calculating free cash flow and working capital and whether you consider it to be appropriate. In evaluating these financial measures, you should consider the types of events and transactions that are not reflected in free cash flow and working capital and should not consider free cash flow in isolation or as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities or other measures of liquidity prepared in accordance with IFRS or U.S. GAAP or as a reliable measure of our ability to service our debt. In addition, free cash flow does not provide precise indications as to the level of our adherence to the terms of the Indenture and Senior Credit Facilities Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Approximately 70% of our business is retailer brands and approximately 30% is contract manufacturing. We also manufacture and sell specialty soft drink products on a small scale under our own brands. We have operations in Europe and North America, with a manufacturing network of 59 production facilities operating 270 production lines across 12 countries. Our European operations are in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, the UK, Spain, Finland and Poland. Our North American operations are in the United States, Canada and Mexico. We manufacture a broad portfolio of products for our retailer brands and contract manufacturing customers. Our portfolio comprises carbonated soft drinks (‘‘CSDs’’), bottled water, fruit and vegetable juices, sports and energy drinks, still drinks, including ready-to-drink tea (‘‘RTD tea’’), and dilutables. We offer our products in a wide range of packaging sizes and types. Given our position as a leading bottler of soft drinks in key markets, we believe we have a large impact not only on our customers but also on our employees and the environment. As such, we have a group-wide approach to corporate social responsibility and quality management which we implement across our business units. Our three-pillar approach focuses on workplace safety, sustainability and maintaining the highest food quality standards while creating healthier products. Our sustainability initiatives include creating sustainable packaging solutions, reduction of water use and energy consumption, improving the sustainability of our supply chain and maximizing our use of green transport.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623
213_2,Offerings 2018.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.1,Clear scale benefits from being the world’s largest independent bottler,"We are the world’s largest independent bottler of retailer brands soft drinks by volume and a leading contract manufacturer for A-brands by volume in Europe and North America with leadership positions across all of our activities and geographies. Approximately 70% of our business is retailer brands and 30% is contract manufacturing. We are approximately 4.1 times larger than our next largest competitor (excluding pureplay water players) in the Addressable Soft Drinks Market based on our reported volume for 2017 and competitors’ volume according to GlobalData, 2017. Our manufacturing network comprises 59 production facilities operating 270 production lines across 12 countries through which we are well-positioned to serve local markets. As such, we benefit from significant economies of scale. We sustain competitive margins through managing both procurement and operating expenses, including the optimization of our plants and streamlining of overhead costs. We are also able to leverage our platform and scale in negotiations with customers and suppliers, which we believe gives us clear scale benefits that our smaller competitors cannot match. Our global platform gives us an advantage because we can service our customers across all key product categories in Europe and North America. We are differentiated from our competitors through our pan-European footprint. In our key European markets, we have a sizeable leading market share according to management estimates. We also have a national presence in the United States. Furthermore, we are licensed by a majority of A-brands to produce their products, which gives us a key strategic advantage as compared to other contract manufacturers. Our global manufacturing footprint provides co-proximity to our customers, enabling us to minimize distribution expenses while also reducing the impact of our business activities on the environment. This proximity and flexibility differentiates us from our competitors and enables us to develop exclusive and long-lasting relationships with our customers. Our size contributes to economies of scale in production costs and distribution, and our production platform and mix of retailer brands and contract manufacturing volumes enable us to continuously optimize our efficiency and capacity utilization. Our size also affords us greater market intelligence capabilities that lead to improved service levels, innovation and flexibility. As a result of our scale, we also benefit from a distinct purchasing edge as compared to our competitors. We believe that this gives us a crucial advantage in an industry where purchasing costs account for a large proportion of sales. Given the highly consolidated supplier base for key raw materials, we benefit from competitive input pricing and preferential supply and payment terms, particularly in comparison with our smaller competitors. This scale benefit is further amplified by our coordinated approach to procurement. Additionally, to ensure we have alternatives when needed, we are continuously looking to broaden our supplier base for the most important raw and packaging materials, such as through sourcing from smaller suppliers or replacing with alternative products. In addition, we have dedicated experts with extensive market knowledge for each key raw materials category.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623
213_2,Offerings 2018.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.2,Leadership positions in attractive and growing markets,"We have leadership positions in Europe and North America. In Europe, we are the number one player by volume in retailer brands with approximately 18% market share of the European Soft Drinks Market, were approximately 2.8 times larger than our next largest competitor (excluding pureplay water players) based on our reported volume for 2017 and competitors’ volume according to GlobalData, 2017. In addition, we 2 ----- also have a leading market position in European contract manufacturing. In the U.S., the market is highly fragmented and we are the only player with operations across the country among more than 250 smaller players that are generally focused on limited regions or categories. Approximately one-third of our volume is sold in North America, with the U.S. being the largest single market globally with an annual consumption of approximately 114 billion liters and the highest consumption per capita in the world as of December 31, 2016. In the U.S., consumption per capita is approximately 381 liters per year on average, whereas consumption per capita is approximately 206 liters per year in Western Europe, approximately 169 liters per year in Latin America, approximately 70 liters per year in China and approximately 42 liters per year in the rest of Asia. From 2016 to 2021, volume in the North American Soft Drinks Market, is expected to increase at a rate of 1.4% per year. Between 2011 and 2016, volume grew at approximately 1.0% per year according to GlobalData, 2017. The European Soft Drinks Market is the second largest market globally with an annual consumption of 102 billion liters. Volumes are expected to increase by 0.7% per year from 2016 to 2021, compared to 0.2% per year from 2011 to 2016. Our largest market within Europe in terms of volume is the UK, where volume growth has been relatively flat between 2011 and 2016 but is expected to grow at a forecasted CAGR of 0.8% from 2016 to 2021 according to GlobalData, 2017. Furthermore, the UK is expected to contribute 13% to the European Soft Drinks Market’s volume by 2021 according to GlobalData, 2017. We expect that contract manufacturing will be the key growth driver for us in the short-term with strong underlying structural drivers supporting long-term growth. We are the largest contract manufacturing player in both the European Soft Drinks Market and the North American Soft Drinks Market, with our contract manufacturing operations generating approximately 30% of our combined volume in 2017. We have also entered into contract manufacturing of water and mineral water, which we believe provides us with an additional opportunity for growth. Historically, contract manufacturing volumes have grown slightly faster than expected due to increased outsourcing. A-brands have increasingly focused on asset-light strategies and look to outsource non-core bottling processes. Further, the market has evolved to a point where a large number of small brands and independent manufacturers are creating successful brands (e.g. Arizona, Monster), which generally lack bottling capabilities and outsource the bottling and fill function. The proliferation of multiple brands and packaging varieties, such as 250ml cans, has encouraged large bottlers to outsource, especially for small volume, to bottlers with greater production flexibility. The industry has also seen a trend of volume shifting away from CSD to juices and still drinks, which are typically lower volume products and are therefore more likely to be outsourced. Additionally, high-growth functional beverages, such as enhanced waters and iced teas, that require greater sophistication in the beverages production process. The production process for these categories chiefly uses aseptic PET (‘‘A-PET’’) filling technology in Europe and hot-fill technology in the U.S., requiring high capital investment and expertise to properly operate, and as a result are often outsourced. We expect these trends to continue driving growth going forward.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623
213_2,Offerings 2018.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.3,"Unique business model, focusing on leadership in retailer brands and contract manufacturing, providing structural competitive advantages","We believe that we have a unique business model as the result of the combination of our retailer brands business, where we manufacture for European and North American retailers and discounters, our contract manufacturing business, where we manufacture for brand owners, and our geographic reach and scale. This combination provides us with several structural competitive advantages. Our business model positions us to take advantage of growth trends in the European Soft Drinks Market and North American Soft Drinks Market as both the retailer brands and contract manufacturing segments are expected to grow between 2017 and 2021. In addition, our focus on retailer brands and contract manufacturing means that, other than for specialty regional drink products, we have limited competition with A-brands, which provides us with an advantage when competing for outsourced branded volumes as compared to the manufacturing and bottling subsidiaries of large A-brand owners that are direct competitors. This is beneficial because the long-term nature of contract manufacturing contracts adds resilience, stability and predictability to our business. A-brand owners are outsourcing the manufacturing of their new and lower volume products because of the increased production complexity as a result of product and packaging diversification. We are able to manufacture these volumes using our optimized plant/line specialization, and reduce overall complexity and switch-over costs as these volumes are relatively large in comparison to our retailer brands product portfolio. Our global platform gives us an advantage because we can service 3 ----- our customers across all key product categories in Europe and North America and are differentiated from our competitors through our pan-European footprint and our national presence in the United States.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

The Cott TB Acquisition provides meaningful diversification to our customer base, reducing dependency on single accounts as well as consolidating A-brand customers. In 2017, on a standalone basis Refresco’s top 10 customers accounted for 58% of its volumes and Cott TB’s top 10 customers accounted for 66% of its volumes. Together, our top 10 customers accounted for 49% of our total combined volumes in 2017. We have longstanding relationships with our customers. Refresco has maintained relationships with 19 of its top 20 customers for over 15 years, which we believe is a testament to the high quality of our products and service. Further, Cott TB has maintained a strong relationship with Walmart for more than 20 years and, following the Cott TB Acquisition, it is now one of our largest customers. We build and maintain these relationships through customer integration, coordinating with our customers in areas such as supply chain (to minimize freight costs and reduce working capital requirements), new product development and packaging designs, market expertize (trends and opportunities) and customer service. The high level of customer integration coupled with our ability to provide a full range of soft drinks products and packaging increases our current and future customers’ dependence on our services, thus leading to long-lasting relationships. We believe that the complementary geographic locations of Cott TB will allow us to consolidate our customer relationships internationally, thus reinforcing partnerships and increasing customer reliance on our business, and thereby reducing the likelihood of potential account losses. Moreover, we will now be able to offer access to a global network, combining Refresco’s strong European capabilities and Cott TB’s strength in North America and the UK. We also believe that this combination will afford us the opportunity to grow alongside our existing European customers, Aldi and Lidl, as they expand in the U.S. We therefore believe that we are well-positioned to strengthen our relationships with our current customers, from both a geographic and product perspective and also to develop relationships with new customers, thus achieving additional utilization from our existing footprint.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

We are currently the number one retailer brands bottler and a leading contract manufacturer across Europe and North America by volume. As we evolved in scale, we gained greater awareness of achievable procurement and footprint optimization synergy opportunities throughout our business. One example is our combination with Gerber Emig, which demonstrated our extremely successful approach to consolidation. We were able to realize synergies from the transaction well ahead of our plan, mainly as a result of faster and higher than expected realization of procurement synergies. Our acquisition of Cott TB similarly offers a substantial synergy potential, particularly through scale benefits. Based on our strong track record of integrating acquisitions and realizing synergies, we expect to generate A34 million of savings through price harmonization and volume bundling, which we believe can be realized relatively quickly. We also believe we can achieve A22 million of operational synergies by optimizing footprint and operational efficiencies through the transfer of lines and manufacturing footprint rationalization. Lastly, we have targeted A6.8 million of achievable overhead synergies through headcount and office space lease reductions as we integrate and streamline our combined operation. Altogether, we anticipate total run-rate synergies of A62.8 million in the first three years following our consolidation, representing 4.3% of Cott TB’s 2017 revenue. See ‘‘Risks Relating to our Business, Strategy and Operations— _We may fail to realize the business growth opportunities, margin benefits and other synergies anticipated from, or may incur unanticipated costs or be exposed to unexpected liabilities associated with or resulting from the Cott TB Acquisition.’’_ 5 ----- We have a strong track record in delivering or exceeding our synergies expectation, and on average have historically achieved synergies of approximately 3.5% to 5.0%.

For instance, we are currently leading the development of A-PET lines in Europe, which we believe will replace more traditional packaging types in the near future, as growth of complex functional beverages continues. A-PET technology is ideal for complex functional beverages because it improves shelf-life and allows for non-refrigerated transportation and storage, while still providing superior taste and vitamin content. We are also continually looking to optimize our product and packaging offerings in collaboration with our customers. In addition, our broad manufacturing platform enables us to respond and quickly adapt to changing customer needs. We also believe our innovation capabilities provide a competitive advantage in tenders as we are able to proactively propose alternative specifications to improve recipes and minimize costs, such as, for instance, through alternative sourcing or packaging solutions. Our track record and abilities in this respect are widely recognized by our customers, which we believe further allows us to continue to strengthen our customers’ confidence in our capabilities.

In order to achieve this, we have identified three key focus areas. First, we will seek to drive growth by completing our portfolio across products and packaging types. Second, we aim to further grow the market share of our retailer brands business, with a particular focus on discounters. Third, we expect a high level of innovation and new product development to contribute to retailer brands volume growth. Growth in sports and energy drinks and RTD tea is also a priority. Contract manufacturing expansion with existing and new customers:_ We aim to increase our contract manufacturing business both in the near- and long-term. The contract manufacturing segment is large, resilient and growing, with significant contract opportunities available to scale players. Branded players are increasingly focused on an ‘‘asset-light’’ strategy given lower returns on manufacturing investment than in core marketing activities, leading them to increasingly favor outsourcing of additional volume. We have a well-developed contract manufacturing business with an unmatched track record with A-brands, while Cott TB offers a platform to further develop the contract manufacturing opportunity in the U.S. Branded players are increasingly looking for manufacturing players able to serve them throughout the footprint and we believe we are uniquely positioned to service customers across multiple categories and geographies.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

We believe there are a number of tangible value-creating opportunities to further consolidate existing markets, in both Europe and North America, and expand into new adjacent markets. However, we maintain a prudent approach in assessing any investment decision using the following criteria to assess potential targets: (i) the possibility to exploit operational synergy potential; (ii) the extent to which the target’s business complements our product and packaging offering; and (iii) whether acquiring the target would reinforce our leading local position. Our framework sets out specific factors to consider when evaluating a potential acquisition, such as synergy potential and reinforcement of leading local positions, and priority areas for acquisitions in terms of region, product, packaging and channel that align with our overall strategic objectives.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Further, additional operational improvement opportunities have been identified in procurement, plant network optimization and Overall Equipment Effectiveness (‘‘OEE’’). The identified procurement categories are grouped in three main areas: raw materials (e.g. orange, carbohydrates, apple), packaging (e.g. cans, liquid paper board, PET) and indirect spend (e.g. transport and warehousing, technical goods and services, utilities and waste). Furthermore, while we have a solid industrial network, we continue to see optimization potential in our asset base which is somewhat fragmented. We expect that optimizing our network and improving its effectiveness could lead to substantial annual savings, consisting primarily of network restructuring, OEE improvements, footprint rationalization and operational synergies. 7 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,623
213_2,Offerings 2018.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Business Strategy,9.5.4,Focus on full synergy extraction resulting from our acquisition of Cott TB,"Our acquisition of Cott TB provides significant and tangible value creation opportunities. Our ambition is to achieve run-rate synergies of A62.8 million in the first three years after the transaction, which represents 4.3% of Cott TB’s 2017 revenue. These synergies were identified by management with assistance from third-party due diligence providers. There are three categories of synergies: procurement, operations and overhead, each respectively representing 2.3%, 1.5% and 0.5% of Cott TB’s 2017 revenue. Procurement synergies are expected to amount to 54% of the total synergies, or A34.0 million, and are anticipated to be generated through price harmonization and volume bundling, which we expect to realize relatively quickly. Operational synergies are estimated to account for 35% of the total synergies, representing A22.0 million, and are expected to come principally from transfer of lines and plant closures. Finally, the remaining 11% of synergies are anticipated to come from overhead synergies, reaching A6.8 million and are anticipated to be achieved through headcount and office space lease reductions. We expect the phasing of synergies to have a ramp-up schedule of 30/60/95/100% from 2018 until 2021, and will require the incurrence of implementation and investment costs to achieve. No commercial (dis)-synergies are anticipated. Implementation and investment costs are assumed to be approximately 94% of run-rate synergies, split over three years as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

213_2,Offerings 2018.md,9,SUMMARY,9.7,The Transactions,9.7.1,The Acquisition,"_The Tender Offer_ On October 3, 2017, after several previous approaches, the Equity Investors approached Refresco’s Boards with a revised proposal of a recommended public offer (the ‘‘Tender Offer’’) of A19.75 per Refresco Share in cash (cum dividend). On October 18, 2017, Refresco entered into detailed negotiations with the Equity Investors. Refresco’s Boards received extensive financial and legal advice and gave careful consideration to the strategic, financial and social aspects and consequences of the proposed transaction. Following various meetings and negotiations, the consideration offered by the Equity Investors was increased to A20.00 per Refresco Share (cum dividend) (the ‘‘Offer Price’’) representing an aggregate consideration of approximately A1,623 million assuming the acquisition of 100% of the Refresco Shares. On October 24, 2017, Sunshine Investments B.V. and Refresco Group N.V. entered into a merger protocol (the ‘‘Merger Protocol’’), which set forth the principal terms and condition of the Acquisition and the Tender Offer. In addition, irrevocable undertakings with certain major shareholders of Refresco to tender all shares held by them in Refresco were agreed. On January 22, 2018, the AFM approved the tender offer memorandum setting out the key terms of the Tender Offer. On January 23, 2018, Sunshine Investments B.V. launched the Tender Offer, subject to certain conditions. 8 ----- Refresco’s extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ‘‘EGM’’) was held on March 5, 2018. At the EGM, the shareholders approved: (i) the amendment of the Articles of Association of Refresco to allow the company to be converted from a public limited liability company (naamloze vennootschap) to a private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) following the de-listing of Refresco; and (ii) the appointment of the new members of the Supervisory Board and the discharge of the resigning members of the Supervisory Board (as further described in ‘‘Management’’). When the initial acceptance period expired on March 19, 2018 (the ‘‘Acceptance Closing Date’’), 97.4% of the Refresco Shares had been tendered, and consequently the minimum acceptance level, as well as the other conditions to the Tender Offer, were satisfied. On March 29, 2018, the initial settlement of the Tender Offer occurred, and Sunshine Investments B.V. acquired 97.4% of the Refresco Shares. On April 3, 2018, the post-acceptance period expired with 2.0% of the Refresco Shares having been tendered. On April 9, 2018 (the ‘‘Post-Acceptance Settlement Date’’), the settlement of the post-acceptance period tenders occurred and Sunshine Investments B.V. acquired 2.0% of the Refresco Shares. In aggregate, Sunshine Investments B.V. acquired 99.4% of the Refresco Shares. On March 29, 2018, Refresco repaid its outstanding syndicated term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of A1,831.4 million (equivalent) using proceeds from the Term Loan B Facility. However, A24.7 million of existing debt of Refresco comprised of the Mortgage Loan and finance leases as of December 31, 2017 was not refinanced as part of the Transactions. _De-Listing and Squeeze-Out_ On March 26, 2018, Sunshine Investments B.V. commenced the process of de-listing Refresco from Euronext Amsterdam. Euronext Amsterdam has confirmed that it has given its consent to the de-listing request. De-listing will take place on April 26, 2018 and the last day that the Refresco Shares can be traded on Euronext will therefore be April 25, 2018. The conversion to a private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) (the ‘‘Conversion’’) is expected to occur shortly following the de-listing. Following the Conversion, Sunshine Investments B.V. intends to commence a compulsory acquisition procedure in accordance with article 2:92a or 2:201a of the Dutch civil code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) (the ‘‘DCC’’) or the takeover buy-out procedure in accordance with article 2:359c of the DCC to buy out the shareholders who have not tendered their Refresco Shares under the Tender Offer (the ‘‘Squeeze-Out’’). A Squeeze-Out typically takes three to six months to complete, but it would take longer in the event that shareholders file objections. Following the Squeeze-Out, we expect that Sunshine Investments B.V. will own 100% of the Refresco Shares. _Post-Squeeze-Out Mergers_ Following the completion of the Squeeze-Out, we expect to merge Refresco Holding B.V. into Refresco Group N.V., which will have been converted into a private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap _met beperkte aansprakelijkheid). We then expect to merge Refresco Group N.V. into Sunshine_ Investments B.V. Please see ‘‘—Summary Corporate and Financing Structure’’ for further information on our expected structure following (a) the completion of the Squeeze-Out and (b) following the Post-Squeeze-Out Mergers. _Sources and Uses for the Acquisition_ The funding sources for the Acquisition, the repayment of the syndicated term loan facility that was borrowed in connection with the Cott TB Acquisition and the payment of related fees and expenses consist of the following: - equity contributions from the Equity Investors in the form of equity and quasi-equity (including common and preferred equity instruments and deeply subordinated shareholder loans) totaling an amount of approximately A982.8 million (the ‘‘Equity Contribution’’), the proceeds of which have been contributed to Sunshine Investments B.V. through the Issuer and intermediate holding companies (see ‘‘—Summary Corporate and Financing Structure’’); - drawings by Sunshine Investments B.V. under the Term Loan B Facility in an aggregate amount of A1,958.5 million (equivalent); 9 ----- - drawings by Sunshine Investments B.V. under the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount of approximately A90.0 million; - drawings by the Issuer under the Bridge Facility in an aggregate amount of A445.0 million, the proceeds of which have been on-lent to Sunshine Investments B.V. and which will be refinanced with the proceeds from the Offering (see ‘‘—The Refinancing’’); and - cash on hand in an aggregate amount of approximately A46.7 million. The notional sources and uses necessary to consummate the Acquisition, repay Refresco’s syndicated term loan facility and pay related fees and expenses are shown in the table below. The funding sources described above and the sources and uses in the table below show the acquisition of 100% of the Refresco Shares, which we expect to occur following the Squeeze-Out.

The purchase price of $1,259.9 million was financed by a syndicated term loan facility, which was refinanced as a part of the Acquisition. See ‘‘—The Transactions—The _Acquisition—Sources and Uses for the Acquisition.’’ Refresco also closed deal-contingent U.S. dollar-_ denominated hedges for a total amount of $750 million to hedge the U.S. dollar cash out flow relating the transaction. The integration of the two companies in North America commenced after closing. In the UK, we were able to begin integrating Cott TB’s UK operations into our business following the acceptance by the Competition and Markets Authority of the sale of the Nelson A-PET facility to Sunmagic Juice. The Nelson A-PET facility accounted for 10 million liters of Cott TB’s volume of 3,937.9 million liters in the financial year 2017. The Cott TB Acquisition was completed to address expected retailer brands market growth in the U.S. driven by the expansion of discounters, expanding footprint of online retailers and macro factors. We believe that the acquisition of the Cott Traditional Business is a unique transaction for Refresco and that our customers will benefit from access to an enhanced network combining our strong European capabilities and Cott TB’s strength in North America. We are particularly enthusiastic about the opportunity to further develop our business for retail customers in North America. Refresco nearly doubled the size of its business through the Cott TB Acquisition gaining approximately 4,400 new colleagues and 29 manufacturing sites in North America and the UK and enabling it to provide retailers and A-brands with greater access to reliable supply chain solutions in key beverage markets. Cott TB is well established in this segment with more than 85% of its bottling activities being for leading retailers in the U.S. and the UK. In terms of contract manufacturing, Cott TB’s rapidly growing share of this market further strengthens our prominent position as an independent bottling partner for A-brands on both continents. Combining this strong market position with Refresco’s knowledge, experience and best practices across Europe will provide us a solid platform on which to support further growth.

Under the SPA, the parties have agreed that within a specified period following the closing date of the Cott TB Acquisition, Refresco will calculate the post-closing adjustments and deliver them to Cott Corporation, so that Cott Corporation can adjust the estimated consideration accordingly. Cott Corporation then has 45 days after the delivery of the post-closing adjustments to either accept or object to them. If Cott Corporation fails to reject Refresco’s post-closing adjustments, they will become binding. If Cott Corporation objects, the parties will attempt to negotiate an agreement, and if they cannot reach agreement, either party can submit the matter to a specified third party to reach a final and binding determination on the matter. Cott Corporation has provided Refresco with customary representations and warranties relating to, among other things, Cott Corporation’s organization and conduct, authority to enter into the agreement, and title to relevant equity interests, assets and liabilities and tax matters.

(the ‘‘Proceeds Loan’’), any other intercompany receivables owed to the Issuer by Sunshine Investments B.V. and the Issuer’s material bank accounts located in the Netherlands. See ‘‘Summary—The Offering—Collateral.’’ The Notes will be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Issuer and its subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes or the Note Guarantees or that is secured on a first-ranking basis over property and assets that secure the Notes or the Note Guarantees on a second-ranking basis (including obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations), to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness. (6) The Notes will be guaranteed by Sunshine Investments B.V. on the Issue Date. As of the date of this offering memorandum, Sunshine Investments B.V. owns approximately 99.4% of the Refresco Shares. We expect Sunshine Investments B.V. will own 100% of the Refresco Shares following the Squeeze-Out. See ‘‘The Transactions.’’ All subsidiaries of Sunshine Investments B.V. are 100% owned by members of the Group except for Refresco Deutschland Holding GmbH in Germany in which the Group holds a 90% interest, Northeast Retailer Brands LLC in the U.S. in which the Group holds a 51% interest, Entsorgungs GmbH in Germany in which the Group holds a 40% interest and Genprobio Srl in Italy in which the Group holds a 20% interest. Following the completion of the Squeeze-Out, Refresco Holding B.V. is expected to merge into Refresco Group N.V. (which will have already been converted into a private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid)). Refresco Group N.V. will subsequently merge into Sunshine Investments B.V. (collectively, the ‘‘Post-Squeeze-Out Mergers’’). (7) In connection with the Acquisition, Sunshine Investments B.V. entered into the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement. The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement provides for facilities in the form of (a) the Term Loan B Facility in an amount of A1,958.5 million (equivalent) based on an EUR/USD exchange rate of A1.00/$1.20 and a EUR/GBP exchange rate of A1.00/£0.89 as of December 31, 2017, (b) the committed Revolving Credit Facility in an amount of up to A200 million and (c) uncommitted ancillary facilities. All of the Guarantors and the Issuer will guarantee the Senior Credit Facilities on a senior basis and such guarantees will rank senior to the Note Guarantors of each Guarantor and pari passu with the Notes. The Senior Credit Facilities will be secured by the Shared Collateral on a firstranking basis as of the Issue Date. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Credit _Facilities Agreement.’’ As of the date of this offering memorandum, the Term Loan B Facility has been_ drawn in full and the Revolving Credit Facility has been drawn in an amount of A90.0 million. (8) On the Completion Date, Sunshine Investments B.V. contributed A1,817.5 million of the proceeds of the Term Loan B Facility to Refresco in order to repay Refresco’s syndicated term loan facility borrowed in connection with the Cott TB Transaction. A24.7 million of existing debt as of December 31, 2017 comprised of the Mortgage Loan, other loans and finance leases will remain outstanding following the Issue Date. (9) Refresco Group N.V. is currently listed on Euronext Amsterdam. We have filed a de-listing request with Euronext Amsterdam and we intend to subsequently convert Refresco into a private limited liability company. Euronext Amsterdam has given its consent to the de-listing request. De-listing will take place on April 26, 2018 and the last day that the Refresco Shares can be traded on Euronext will therefore be April 25, 2018. (10) Subject to certain adjustments and the agreed security principles in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement will require Sunshine Investments B.V. to ensure that its subsidiaries that are members of the restricted group under the Senior Credit Facilities that generate at least 80% of ‘‘Consolidated EBITDA’’ (as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement) are guarantors under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement: (i) on the date which is 120 days after the date on which Refresco Group N.V. has been converted into a private limited liability company (the ‘‘Control Date’’); and (ii) the date when the annual financial statements are required to be delivered to the agent under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement. We anticipate that following the accession of the guarantors to the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes will be guaranteed by either (a) Refresco Benelux B.V., 16 ----- Refresco Americas B.V., Gerber Emig Group Limited, Refresco Beverages UK Limited, Refresco Holding B.V., Refresco Europe B.V., Refresco Canada Inc., Refresco Beverages US Inc. (formerly Cott Beverages Inc.), Cliffstar LLC, DIS B.V. and Cott Beverages Limited, or (b) such other combination of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer as provide a guarantee of the Senior Credit Facilities on or prior to the date falling 120 days after the Control Date (the ‘‘Post-Control Date Guarantors’’ and, together with Sunshine Investments B.V., the ‘‘Guarantors’’). Only our subsidiaries that are required to provide a guarantee under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, will be Post-Control Date Guarantors. Certain of our subsidiaries in Italy and France that may provide a guarantee of the Senior Credit Facilities will not provide a Note Guarantee. In addition, none of our subsidiaries in Germany or Mexico will provide a Note Guarantee. Each Note Guarantee will be a senior subordinated obligation of the relevant Guarantor. The Note Guarantees will be subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior indebtedness of that Guarantor (including obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations). The Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes, including their obligations to trade creditors. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Issuer and the Post-Control Date Guarantors (as listed in clause (a) of the definition in the ‘‘Description of the Notes’’) accounted for 65.4% of our _pro forma Adjusted EBITDA. (11) OKIL Holding 2 B.V. has acquired 10% of the shares of Refresco Deutschland Holding GmbH from Refresco Europe B.V. for consideration of A15.6 million. Refresco Deutschland Holding GmbH has deferred OKIL Holding 2 B.V.’s obligation to pay consideration for the transaction.

For purposes of preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information, certain adjustments have been made to the bases mentioned above (the ‘‘unaudited pro forma adjustments’’). The unaudited _pro forma adjustments are based on currently available financial information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The unaudited _pro forma condensed consolidated financial information gives effect to_ _pro forma adjustments that are directly attributable to the transactions described in the preceding paragraph and it does not reflect anticipated opereating efficiencies, cost savings or other synergies that may be achieved from the same transactions. The unaudited _pro forma condensed consolidated financial information is presented solely for informational purposes and is not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated income statements or financial position had the Transactions been completed as of the dates and for the periods 30 ----- presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results.

213_2,Offerings 2018.md,861,SUMMARY HISTORICAL COMBINED CARVE-OUT FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA OF COTT TB,861.20,SUMMARY PRO FORMA AND OTHER ADJUSTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information,861.20.2,Accounting for the Acquisition and the Cott TB Acquisition,"The Issuer, through Sunshine Investments B.V., its wholly owned subsidiary, acquired 99.378% of the Refresco Shares as of April 9, 2018, for cash consideration of A1,613 million and expects to acquire the remaining Refresco Shares for cash consideration of approximately A10 million pursuant to the Squeeze-Out as described in ‘‘The Transactions—The Acqusition—The Squeeze-Out. On January 30, 2018, Refresco acquired Cott TB for a purchase price of $1,259.9 million. The Cott TB Acquisition and the Acquisition will be accounted for by the Issuer under IFRS, as adopted by the European Union, using the acquisition method as defined by IFRS 3 Business Combinations (‘‘IFRS 3’’). Under IFRS 3, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair value on the date of acquisition and the consideration transferred is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed separately from goodwill. As of the date of this offering memorandum, the unaudited _pro forma condensed consolidated financial information presented in this offering memorandum is based_ on a preliminary allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on the historical carrying amounts of such assets and liabilities included in the Refresco Financial Statements and the Cott TB Financial Statements, in each case, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017. The valuation studies necessary to finalize the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the related allocation of the consideration transferred have not been completed. Therefore, the difference between (a) the total expected consideration transferred and (b) the net carrying amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed by Refresco on the completion date of the Cott TB Acquisition and by the Issuer the Completion Date, respectively, has been fully allocated to goodwill in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet. A final determination of fair value on the date of acquisition of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed may differ significantly from the amounts reflected in the Issuer’s unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet included herein and, among other things, could result in a material change in our amortization and depreciation expense relating to identifiable assets acquired. Management believes that significant changes in the amount of goodwill recognized in relation to the Acquisition and/or the Cott TB Acquisition may arise due to the final dtermination of the purchase price allocation. 31 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Statements concerning our synergies are based on our Equity Investor’s and management’s current belief as to the outcome and timing of future events. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on numerous assumptions and that our actual synergies may differ materially from the forward-looking statements included here. You should read the information set forth in conjunction with ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Business, Strategy and Operations—We may fail to realize the business growth _opportunities, margin benefits and other synergies anticipated from, or may incur unanticipated costs or be exposed to unexpected liabilities associated with or resulting from the Cott TB Acquisition.’’ In addition, Pro Forma Synergies Adjusted EBITDA does not_ purport to indicate our future consolidated results of operations.

(b) Reflects management’s estimates of incremental EBITDA that would have been generated in the year ended December 31, 2017 in the event that the weather in the third quarter of 2017 had been consistent with historical temperature and precipitation levels. In the third quarter of 2017, Europe experienced unusually low temperature and high rain in summer 2017 compared to the five-year historical average. Refresco’s Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017, as further adjusted to include the operation and weather adjustments described in these footnotes (a) and (b), amounts to A227.9 million. (c) Our ambition is to achieve run-rate synergies of A62.8 million in the first three years after the transaction, which represents 4.3% of Cott TB’s 2017 revenue. The adjustment of A43.7 million reflects management’s and the Equity Investors’ estimates of the total potential forward-looking run-rate synergies that could be realized in the first 18 months as a result of the Cott TB Acquisition based on due diligence estimates. These synergies are described in further detail below: (i) Relates to integration and streamlining of our combined organization, which will be achieved through headcount and office space lease reductions. (ii) Relates to the realization of certain operating efficiencies, which will primarily be achieved through the transfer of production lines and plant closures.

Although we believe the flexibility of our manufacturing capabilities is one of our core strengths, our customers may demand changes to our product mix to which we may not be readily able to adapt in a timely manner or at all. Such changes could include a shift from one product category to another or changes to packaging sizes or types. There can be no assurance that we can successfully adapt our production sites or lines to meet our customers’ requirements. In addition, end-consumers are seeking increased variety in their drinks, and there is a growing concern among the public regarding the ingredients in soft drinks products, the attributes of those ingredients, and health and wellness issues generally. End-consumer interest in or concerns regarding nutrition, health and lifestyle changes in general, and legislative changes might result in a decrease in end-consumer demand for soft drinks with sugar and artificial ingredients, and could conversely increase end-consumer demand for products associated with health and wellness such as water, teas and juices not made from concentrates. For example, France and Finland have introduced taxes on sugar-sweetened drinks and similar measures are being considered in other places, including other EU member states. If such taxes were to be broadly introduced it could shift consumer demand away from CSDs and other sugar-sweetened drinks. A shift in product categories could result in lower margins which could potentially lead to the need for investments in new production lines. In particular, a shift away from products such as carbonated drinks, sugar-sweetened drinks, artificially sweetened drinks and caffeinated drinks, which represented over a third of our volumes in 2017, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. End-consumer preferences could also change due to a variety of other factors, including a downturn in the economy, aging of the general population, changes in social trends, the real or perceived impact that the manufacturing of our products has on the environment, changes in end-consumer demographics, changes in travel, vacation or leisure activity patterns, or negative publicity resulting from regulatory action or litigation against companies in our industry. See ‘‘—Our results depend on general economic conditions and _could be affected by deterioration in the economic conditions of our markets.’’ Any of these changes may_ reduce end-consumer demand for soft drinks in general and, consequently, customer demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we can adapt to meet our customers’ requirements or develop innovative products that respond to end-consumer trends.

However, these expected margin benefits, cost savings, business growth opportunities and other synergies may not develop, may be materially lower than estimated or may require significant unanticipated costs. In addition, other assumptions upon which we determined the consideration may prove to be incorrect. We may also face challenges with the following: - redeploying or reducing resources in different areas of operations to improve efficiency; - analyzing or implementing measures relating to purchase synergies; - the diversion of management attention from on-going business concerns; - addressing possible differences between our business culture, processes, controls, procedures and systems and those of Cott TB; - difficulties related to the integration of departments, information technology systems and accounting systems; - difficulties in conforming Cott TB’s accounting, book and records, internal accounting controls and procedures and policies to ours; - retaining employees who may be vital to the integration of Cott TB or to the future prospects of the combined business; - retaining the loyalty and business of the Cott TB customers; - unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual or other issues; and - unanticipated costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities. Additionally, we may need to increase staff, such as hiring additional staff in our corporate team, to accommodate the current size of the Group. Under any of these circumstances, the margin benefits, cost savings, business growth opportunities and other synergies we anticipate as a result of the acquisition may not be achieved as expected, or at all, or may be delayed materially.

The success of this strategy with respect to acquisitions, such as the acquisition of Cott TB, depends on our ability to identify suitable targets, conduct appropriate due diligence, negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions and integrate acquired businesses into our group within a reasonable timeframe and achieve anticipated synergies and benefits In addition, we may not complete future acquisitions at all, or not on the terms as contemplated, due to antitrust or competition constraints or for other reasons. For example, the purchase price demanded for a future acquisition, or the costs relating to such acquisition (including in connection with required remedies to address antitrust or competition constraints), may turn out to be higher than is justified. We may not achieve the integration of future acquisitions as expeditiously as expected or the related synergies may not be realized. The potential difficulties of integrating the operations of acquired businesses include, among others: - diversion of a significant amount of management’s attention; - analyzing or implementing measures relating to purchase synergies; - difficulty obtaining regulatory approvals and lack of experience in operating in new geographical markets; 37 ----- - assumption of and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of acquired businesses; - failure to smoothly implement our business plan for the combined businesses; - unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics and other systems; - possible inconsistencies in standards and controls between the acquired business and our structure; - failure to retain key customers, suppliers or employees; and - other unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities. If we acquire fewer other businesses than our competitors, or are less successful in the integration of acquired businesses than our competitors, then those competitors may grow more quickly than us or could realize synergies that we do not realize, or realize to a lesser extent, which they may be able to partially pass along to customers.

Customers in our contract manufacturing business generally source their own raw materials and so our exposure to price fluctuations primarily impacts our retailer brands business, consisting of 70% of our volume as of December 31, 2017. While we aim to purchase sufficient raw materials and packaging materials to meet our estimated sales volumes, these estimates may prove inaccurate, particularly as many customers do not commit to fixed volumes. See ‘‘—Our business depends on a significant supply of raw materials and packaging materials from a limited _number of third-party suppliers.’’ If we achieve higher than expected sales volumes, we may need to_ purchase additional raw materials and packaging materials at prevailing market prices. In addition, we are also exposed to fluctuations in the prices of commodities, such as electricity, natural gas and other energy sources and for which there are no long-term pricing commitments or arrangements which could have an effect on our operating costs. Further, our operations are dependent on local water supplies and any decrease in availability or increase in prices of water could also have an effect on our operating costs. If our raw materials or packaging materials costs or other operating costs increase, it may not be possible to pass these costs on to customers through price adjustments or in a timely manner or at all. In general, input price fluctuations can only be passed on to our customers at the renewal of the relevant contracts. Additionally, any price increases that we pass along to customers could reduce demand for our products.

For the supply of raw materials and packaging materials, we estimate the volume of supplies needed based on sales contracts with our customers. Our estimate of the supplies required may not be accurate and there may be a mismatch between the estimated and actual volumes sold, resulting in an increase or decrease in demand for raw materials and packaging materials. Although we attempt to ensure that sufficient raw materials and packaging materials are in stock, a number of factors may cause a shortage of materials available to meet the demand from our customers. Although we have adopted a policy to enter into forward purchase contracts for most raw materials and packaging materials up to 12 months in advance to cover sales positions with our customers, the limited number of suppliers for these materials undermines our negotiating position. As such, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective. In addition, this matching policy does not extend to all materials (PET for instance is only partly covered) nor to all situations (small contracts for example are not always covered). Further, we can only purchase certain raw materials, such as sugar, during the harvest season. 38 ----- The failure of suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons, including fires, natural disasters, weather, manufacturing problems, disease, crop failure, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, political instability and terrorism. A failure of supply could also occur due to our suppliers’ financial difficulties. The loss of any one of such suppliers could lead to a disruption in our supply chain, which could reduce the utilization rates of our manufacturing sites and deliveries to customers, and in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our reputation could be jeopardized by a failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for our activities, including human rights related challenges in our supply chains. While we require our suppliers to comply with local legislation, to sign our Supplier Code of Conduct and to be able to demonstrate compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct upon request, compliance by our third-party suppliers is outside of our control. Any such non-compliance with local legislation or our Supplier Code of Conduct could harm our business and/or our reputation.

Disaster recovery plans may not prevent business disruption, and reconstruction of any damaged facilities could require a significant amount of time and money. In addition, inventory of raw materials, packaging materials and finished products could be damaged or lost. Although we carry insurance to cover losses at production sites and interruptions in the business, such policies are subject to limitations such as deductibles and maximum liability amounts and, therefore, may not cover all losses, including loss of the business which customers may have placed with competitors as a result of such interruptions. We may also incur losses that are outside of the coverage of insurance policies. In the future, it may not be possible to obtain insurance coverage at current levels, or at all, and premiums may increase significantly on the coverage that is maintained. As a result, significant losses could occur if any of our production sites were damaged or ceased operation for any other reason. We are particularly dependent on ten sites: Bodegraven and Sittard in the Netherlands, Erftstadt in Germany, St. Alban and Marges in France, Bridgwater in the UK, Caslino al Piano in Italy, Ninove in Belgium and Wharton and Lakeland in the U.S. Together, these ten sites accounted for approximately 35% of our volume in 2017.

Currently, retailers work together at both the national and international level to apply pricing pressure, and further integration at the regional level can further strengthen the buying power of the retailers. Additionally, retailers cooperate with other retailers in purchasing groups, which give them significant buying power.

The retailer brands soft drinks market in which we are active is highly competitive and some of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources, lower costs, significant unutilized capacity or stronger customer relationships than we have. Certain retailer brands products, such as CSDs, also indirectly compete for retail shelf space with contract manufacturing products. An increase in the number of competitors in the retailer brands market may lead to a decrease of sales and prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. In our contract manufacturing business, we compete indirectly with soft drinks brand owners that either manufacture their own products or decide to take their production in-house. We also compete directly with other contract manufacturers on the basis of quality, ability to deliver a diversified product mix, pricing and customer service. The contract manufacturing soft drinks market is highly competitive and some of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources, lower cost bases, significant unutilized capacity or stronger customer relationships than ours. Contract manufacturing competitors could use their significant resources to develop new products with which we cannot easily compete. Our customers also could reduce their pricing to levels that we cannot match without adversely affecting our results of operations. It may also be possible for current or future competitors to develop new product manufacturing technologies or processes that would enable them to offer products at a cost or quality that gives them a significant advantage over our products. We may not be able to continue to compete successfully against existing or future competitors. Contract manufacturing products also compete indirectly for retail shelf space with retailer brands products. We do not engage in marketing or advertising for our contract manufacturing products and do not have direct influence over shelf space decisions by retail customers. A-brand competitors have significant financial resources that are heavily invested in promotional programs, which may earn them greater shelf space relative to retailer brands products. If A-brand owners with which we compete increase the frequency of their promotional activities in our key regions/countries, our retailer brands customers may not allocate adequate shelf space for the products supplied by us and, as a result, we could experience a decline in sales volumes, be forced to reduce pricing, forgo price increases required to offset increased costs of raw materials or packaging materials, increase capital and other expenditures or lose market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects. 42 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

We also typically experience a period of higher sales around the Christmas/New Year holiday period. While these end-consumer buying patterns lead to a natural seasonality in our sales, unseasonable weather can also significantly affect our sales and profitability. For example, during prolonged periods of unseasonably hot weather, end-consumers tend to switch to products such as water and ready-to-drink teas that may have lower profit margins as well as require us to adjust our product mix in other ways. Consequently, our operating results can fluctuate. Any inability to adapt to customers’ requirements in terms of seasonality may affect our working capital resulting in loss of sales, oversupply and inventory costs which we may be unable to recover and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Further, from time to time, we may not be in compliance with all aspects of such legislation in various jurisdictions. For instance, Cott TB and, we believe, other industry participants, are currently not in compliance with certain regulations under the Ontario Environmental Protection Act (‘‘OEPA’’), which are not currently being enforced by Ontario and provide that a minimum percentage of a bottler’s soft drink sales within specified areas in Ontario must be made in refillable containers. In the even that Ontario chooses to enforce the OEPA in the future, industry participants that are not in compliance with the regulations could be subject to monetary fines up to the amount of benefit realized as a result of the non-compliance, or in extreme cases, a prohibition of sales of soft drinks in non-refillable containers. We estimate that a de minimis amount of Cott TB’s sales in Canada would be affected. New or more stringent requirements may also be imposed on other aspects of our operations.

An important clarification is that the new withholding tax will only apply to intra-group payments. Payments of interest on, for instance, publicly held listed securities should therefore fall outside of the scope of this new withholding tax. If the envisaged withholding tax on interest payments is implemented in Dutch tax law, we will, pursuant to the provision in ‘‘Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,’’ not be required to pay any additional amounts to holders of the Notes who are a (deemed) tax resident of, or otherwise are connected to, a low-tax jurisdiction (as defined in any Dutch tax law implementing the policy intention presented by the Dutch coalition government) to compensate them for such withholding tax. 49 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indenture do not contain covenants requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be ‘‘benchmarks’’ are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the ‘‘FCA Announcement’’). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Senior Credit Facilities whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR).

Dutch law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside bankruptcy, the actio pauliana provisions. The actio pauliana provisions offer creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third-party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third-party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside the bankruptcy of the relevant person and may be nullified by the bankruptcy trustee in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, if: (i) the person performed such acts without an obligation to do so (onverplicht); (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (om niet) in which case such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on the grounds of fraudulent conveyance.

There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligations in favor of the Security Agent (‘‘Parallel Debt’’) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (‘‘Principal Obligations’’).

For example, under Dutch law, the creation respectively of a valid security interest under a 60 ----- Dutch law governed pledge agreement in relation to certain assets (such as bank accounts) may be subject to the delivery of a notice of pledge by the security agent or the security provider to a third party (for example, the notice of pledge to the account bank in case of a pledge over bank accounts). Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security provider in favor of the security taken over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor. Finally, since the ranking of pledges is determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a later date over the same Collateral, but which came into force for third parties earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate register or by notification) has priority.

Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in the respective jurisdiction of the Non-U.S. Guarantor.

If such an event were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or our other then-existing contractual obligations would allow us to provide such funds to the Issuer. A change of control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration or mandatory prepayment of, the Senior Credit Facilities and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under certain other indebtedness. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Change of Control.’’ The change of control provisions contained in the Indenture may not necessarily give you sufficient protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a ‘‘Change of Control’’ as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under ‘‘Description of _the Notes—Change of Control,’’ the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to_ offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘all or substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

The unaudited _pro forma condensed consolidated income statement of the Issuer for the year ended December 31, 2017 is based on and derived from (i) the audited consolidated income statement of Refresco for the year ended December 31, 2017, prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union (the ‘‘Refresco 2017 Income Statement’’); (ii) the audited combined carve-out income statement of Cott TB for the year ended December 30, 2017, prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP (the ‘‘Cott TB 2017 Carve-Out Income Statement’’); (iii) unaudited condensed income statement information of Sunshine Investments B.V. for the year ended December 31, 2017, prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP; and (iv) unaudited condensed income statement information of the Issuer for the year ended December 31, 2017, prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP. For purposes of preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information, certain adjustments have been made on the basis mentioned above (the ‘‘unaudited pro forma adjustments’’). The unaudited _pro forma adjustments are based on currently available financial information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The unaudited _pro forma condensed consolidated financial information gives effect to_ _pro forma adjustments that are directly attributable to the Pro Forma Transactions and it does not reflect anticipated operating efficiencies, cost savings or other synergies that may be achieved from such transactions. 77 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

On January 30, 2018, Refresco acquired Cott TB for a purchase price of $1,259.9 million. The Cott TB Acquisition and the Acquisition will be accounted for by the Issuer under IFRS, as adopted by the European Union, using the acquisition method as defined by IFRS 3 Business Combinations (‘‘IFRS 3’’). Under IFRS 3, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair value on the date of acquisition and the consideration transferred is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed separately from goodwill. As of the date of this offering memorandum, the unaudited _pro forma condensed consolidated financial information presented in this offering memorandum is based_ on a preliminary allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on the historical carrying amounts of such assets and liabilities included in the Refresco Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the Cott TB Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 30, 2017. The valuation studies necessary to finalize the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the related allocation of the consideration transferred have not been completed. Therefore, the difference between (a) the total expected consideration transferred and (b) the net carrying amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed by Refresco on the completion date of the Cott TB Acquisition and by the Issuer on the Completion Date, respectively, have been fully allocated to goodwill in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet. A final determination of fair value on the date of acquisition of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed may differ significantly from the amounts reflected in the Issuer’s unaudited _pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet included herein and, among other things, could result in a material change in our amortization and depreciation expense relating to identifiable assets acquired. Management believes that significant changes in the amount of goodwill recognized in relation to the Acquisition and/or the Cott TB Acquisition may arise due to the final determination of the purchase price allocation. 78 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Refresco has long-standing relationships with leading discounters and full-service retailers across Europe with a broad and sophisticated range of retailer brand offerings. Refresco is also a contract manufacturing partner for national and international branded beverage companies who can rely on Refresco’s efficient multi-user production platform and additional services. Refresco also manufactures and sells specialty soft drink products on a small scale under its own brands, which are included under the retailer brands segment for reporting purposes. Since 1999, Refresco has expanded its operations through a ‘‘buy-and-build’’ strategy, completing over 20 acquisitions that achieved synergies averaging 3.5% to 5.0% of target revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Refresco’s segments were divided into Europe and North America. Refresco’s European segment is divided into the following business units: Benelux (including the Netherlands and Belgium), Germany, France, Italy, the UK, Iberia (including Spain and Portugal), Finland and Poland. Refresco sold 7,104 million liters of soft drinks and had a gross profit margin per liter of 14.0 euro cents for the year ended December 31, 2017. Refresco’s consolidated revenue was A2,268.8 million and Refresco’s Adjusted EBITDA was A213.9 million, in each case, for the year ended December 31, 2017.

213_2,Offerings 2018.md,864,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF REFRESCO,864.2,Key Factors Affecting Refresco’s Results of Operations,864.2.1,Retailer Brands and Contract Manufacturing Growth,"Refresco’s revenue is derived from manufacturing soft drinks for retail chains under their own retailer brands and from contract manufacturing, the manufacturing of soft drinks for brand owners that have 92 ----- outsourced production to Refresco. In the year ended December 31, 2017, retailer brands accounted for approximately 70% of Refresco’s consolidated revenue and contract manufacturing accounted for the remaining 30%. Retailer brands has historically performed relatively well during economic downturns as end-consumers look to value-for-money alternatives. Retailer brands growth is also driven by consolidation of retail chains (in countries such as Italy and Poland), while in more mature markets such as the UK, the Netherlands and Germany, retailers continue to develop their retailer brands strategies to support growth. Further, the global financial downturn and the weakening of consumer sentiment thereafter helped discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl to gain a strong foothold in the UK market. Revenue derived from contract manufacturing is mainly driven by the outsourcing of production by brand owners. Reasons for outsourcing include: (i) increased focus on ‘‘asset-light’’ strategies; (ii) higher operational efficiency of specialist manufacturing players like us as a result of more management focus and greater ability to optimize line utilization; (iii) a need for backup capacity covering peak demand or breakdowns of their own production lines; and (iv) smaller branded players and new entrants looking for manufacturing capacity throughout the footprint.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Volume (expressed in liters) is the most important driver of revenue. Because changes in revenue are largely driven by fluctuations in input prices that are passed on to customers, volume as well as gross profit margin per liter, Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow may be more meaningful indicators of business performance than revenue. Refresco strives to increase sales volume in order to maximize utilization of its production lines and obtain more competitive input pricing. Volumes are affected by the overall performance of the European and North American economies. Weaker market conditions in Western Europe during 2017 put pressure on retailer brand volumes during the second half of the year due to unusually low temperatures and high levels of precipitation during the summer in almost all markets. In 2017, however, contract manufacturing showed solid growth across most of Refresco’s geographies. Pricing also has a significant impact on Refresco’s revenue and profitability. Refresco’s sales prices for retailer brands are affected by a variety of factors, in particular the cost of raw materials and packaging materials, manufacturing and distributing products and the availability and price of competing products. Refresco invoices the customer for all of these inputs. In contract manufacturing, Refresco operates as a tolling manufacturer and as such the customer provides the raw materials and packaging materials and Refresco bases its pricing on a filling fee. As a result, larger packaged products generate less revenue per liter. The trend over the past years towards smaller sized products has caused revenue to grow at a higher rate than liter volumes. The soft drinks market is fragmented, causing Refresco to adopt different pricing policies per product category. Some of Refresco’s retailer brands products, such as RTD teas, energy drinks and water, compete directly with comparable retailer brands and A-brand products, which constrains Refresco’s ability to set prices. In less competitive categories such as NFC juices and A-PET, Refresco has greater flexibility to adopt pricing strategies that maximize revenue. In newer product categories such as energy drinks packaged in PET and cans, there is also usually greater scope to use new packaging types and sizes to effect price changes. In addition, higher prices can be charged in more remote regions, reflecting the higher transport costs involved in manufacturing and distributing products. _Gross profit margin_ Refresco balances execution of its strategy around gross profit margin and volume growth in order to improve profitability. Refresco’s management tracks the development of price movements relative to volume by the key performance indicator of gross profit margin per liter, calculated as revenue and other income minus raw materials and consumables used, expressed per liter of volume. In general, Refresco considers a higher gross profit margin per liter more important than volume growth, and may therefore decide not to tender for certain low margin customer contracts, move production to other plants or even shut down production at one location altogether in order to protect or increase its gross profit margin per liter. In 2017, gross profit margins were better than expected in spite of the lower volumes in Western Europe, due largely to Refresco’s decision to decrease low margin retailer brand contracts in Germany and Iberia. 93 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

In addition to increasing volume and revenue, Refresco incurs certain one-off costs and expenses in connection with any potential acquisition. Refresco has adjusted for certain of these one-off costs in its Adjusted EBITDA for the period. See ‘‘—Non-GAAP Financial Measures’’ for further information on these adjustments. Refresco completed four acquisitions in 2016 and 2017. Refresco acquired the PepsiCo bottling facility in Germany in February 2016, the Dutch contract manufacturing business DIS in March 2016, Whitlock Packaging (a large-scale bottler focused on contract manufacturing in the U.S.) in July 2016 and San Pellegrino’s bottling facility in Recoaro, Italy in March 2017. Refresco also completed the transformative Cott TB Acquisition on January 30, 2018 nearly doubling the size of its business, gaining 29 manufacturing facilities in North America and the United Kingdom. It is Refresco’s ambition to achieve run-rate synergies relating to procurement, operations and overhead in a total amount of approximately A62.8 million in the first three years following the Cott TB Acquisition. See ‘‘Summary— _Recent Developments—The Cott TB Acquisition.’’_ As a general matter, following an acquisition, Refresco’s results of operations are impacted by the results of the newly acquired business, the purchase accounting for the acquisition, any debt incurred to acquire the business and expenditures made to integrate the newly acquired business. When intending to integrate and improve a newly acquired business, Refresco will: (i) review current sales prices and product engineering to achieve increased margins on products sold; (ii) evaluate ways to further enhance purchasing power towards suppliers to benefit from economies of scale; (iii) reduce duplicated overhead; (iv) move production to the most efficient locations, subject to geography and logistics; (v) share knowledge and experience; (vi) create synergies with and benefits to the existing businesses; and (vii) improve management of working capital. Many of these integration measures require investment in the form of operating costs and capital expenditures.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

In 2017, Refresco spent A1,277.2 million on raw materials and consumables costs. Raw materials constituted 57.7% of this amount, with packing materials and product tax constituting the remaining 41.1% and 1.2%, respectively. Refresco’s exposure to price fluctuations of raw materials and packaging materials mainly impacts its retailer brands business. In contract manufacturing, this price risk is typically borne by the customer, as Refresco operates as a tolling manufacturer. Raw materials include primarily orange juice, apple juice and sugar. Packaging materials are mainly aluminum cans, liquid paperboard and PET. Where feasible, Refresco has a policy of forward purchasing raw materials and packaging materials to cover sales positions with customers. Refresco hedges the raw material aluminum through derivatives. The fair value of this raw material derivative is recognized in profit and loss. The fair value for the year ended December 31, 2017 is A1.0 million debit as compared to A0.8 million debit for the year ended December 31, 2016. Some of Refresco’s raw materials are priced only in U.S. dollars, and Refresco mitigates the effect of exchange rate fluctuations by using U.S. dollars purchase options and forward contracts. Historically, prices for raw materials and packaging materials have fluctuated considerably. In 2017, prices for raw materials generally increased, with the exception of sugar as Europe’s sugar crop was better than anticipated leading to improved availability. The sugar market experienced important changes in October 2017, with the abolition of the quota system for food-use sugar. This resulted in competitive prices from suppliers and caused the European market to shift from an import to an export market. Key packaging material prices were affected by the more favorable economic circumstances and the increasing oil price, resulting in higher overall prices. In addition, the supplier base is highly concentrated, with only a few suppliers available for each category of products sourced. Again, this dependency mainly impacts the retailer brands business, which is more reliant on Refresco’s sourcing than contract manufacturing, where customers largely source the raw materials used. Refresco focuses on creating alternative supply chains to mitigate this dependency by sourcing from smaller suppliers or replacing certain supplies with alternative products. An increase in the prices of raw materials and packaging materials generally leads to an increase in the sales prices of Refresco’s products as these increases can typically be passed on to customers when contracts are renewed because most of the costs, such as sugar and packaging costs, generally affect the 94 ----- entire industry. Refresco attempts to ensure that it always has sufficient raw materials and packaging materials in stock. Refresco has adopted a policy to enter into forward purchase contracts—up to 12 months in advance—for most raw materials and packaging materials to ensure that it can cover sales positions with Refresco’s customers. This allows Refresco to limit its exposure to sales are under- or over-covered by corresponding forward purchase contracts. This matching policy does not extend to all materials (for instance, PET is only partly covered as there is no market and it must be physically stored) or to all situations (for instance, small contracts). A small portion of materials costs experience approximately a half-year delay in passing through the commodity price changes to the agreed sales pricing, resulting in a small upside or downside deviation of gross profit margin per liter over time. In some cases, Refresco may decide not to fully increase the prices of its products in order to sell a greater volume of products.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Higher sales of water and CSDs are also achieved around the Christmas/New Year holiday period in late December. Fruit juice sales are generally evenly spread across the year. Seasonal changes are almost entirely sales relating to the retailer brands business, as Refresco can produce for its contract manufacturing customers upfront. While these end-consumer buying patterns lead to a natural seasonality in sales, unseasonable weather could significantly affect sales and profitability. For example, retailer brand volumes were adversely impacted in 2017 due to unusually low temperatures and high levels of precipitation during the summer in almost all of Refresco’s markets. The geographical diversity and diverse product mix mitigates part of the effect of seasonality.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Typically, Refresco aims to align costs with revenue denominated in the same currency, but Refresco is not always able to do so, and results of operations are consequently impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations. Some raw materials, such as frozen concentrated orange juice, are only available for sale in U.S. dollars. As with raw materials prices, Refresco hedges its currency exposures back-to-back. During the periods under review, Refresco hedged 80% to 100% of its foreign currency exposure on contracted forecasted purchases. Refresco uses currency option contracts and forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risks, most of which have a maturity date of less than one year from the reporting date. When necessary, foreign currency contracts are rolled over on maturity. Further, annual changes to raw material costs driven by exchange rates can generally be passed on to the customers with a slight time lag, in the same way as fluctuations in raw materials prices, at the time a customer’s contract is renewed. In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, Refresco aims to ensure that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates. The fair value of foreign currency instruments as at December 31, 2017 was A2.6 million as compared to A9.7 million debit as at December 31, 2016. Additionally, Refresco entered into deal contingent hedges of a total amount of $750.0 million to hedge the cash out flow for the acquisition of Cott TB. The contracts were valued as at December 31, 2017 at a fair value of A2.8 million debit. The deal contingent hedges settled on January 29, 2018 in line with management’s estimate. For further information, please refer to note 6.5 of the Refresco Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The amounts deferred in equity at year-end are expected to occur and to affect profit or loss for majority in 2017. See footnote 3 to the Refresco Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 for further information. _Translational_ Refresco reports its consolidated financial statements in its functional currency which is the euro. As a result, the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of all of its operations with a currency other than the euro are translated into euro at then applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of the euro affect the value of these items with respect to the non-euro-denominated businesses in the consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. For example, a stronger euro will reduce the reported results of operations of non-euro businesses and 95 ----- conversely a weaker euro will increase the reported results of operations of non-euro businesses. These translations could significantly affect the comparability of Refresco’s results between financial periods and/or result in significant changes to the carrying value of Refresco’s assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity. The effects of these translations are recorded in the consolidated income statement as exchange differences on retranslation of foreign operations.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

This is mainly due to the acquisition of Whitlock Packaging and significant costs relating to the introduction of new products and new production lines across the business. These differences resulted in relatively higher other operating costs such as temporary staff, direct production cost, external warehousing cost and maintenance cost.

As a percentage of total volume retailer brands volume comprised 73.2% of total volume in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 80.9% in the year ended December 31, 2015. The retailer brands market faces competition from A-brand products as the price gap has decreased, which is directly linked to raw material price movements. A smaller price difference between A-brand and retailer brands products makes it easier for consumers to choose A-brand products. In particular, retailer brands had a challenging start of the year in 2016 as a result of Refresco’s commercial decision to discontinue low margin-large volume contracts for water and CSD products in Poland and Germany, which impacted its volumes, but did not impact its profitability.

It started up the commercial production of a second A-PET line in the Benelux, enabling the production of more natural, preservative free drinks. Refresco also invested in a third autoclave in the Benelux, a production technology that enables it to produce cold coffee drinks and protein drinks in can format. In France, Refresco installed new A-PET lines and invested in a new Elopak carton line to match the growing demand for organic and premium juices in more sustainable carton packaging. A new low-acid line became operational in 2017 in the UK and Refresco additionally invested in a new A-PET line to meet the demand for low- and high-acid drinks, which is expected to become operational in 2018. Refresco’s investments in a high-speed water line in Poland during 2016 also came on line this year. In Germany, Refresco decided to transfer A-PET bottling activities from its Hamburg manufacturing site to Calv¨orde because this site runs more modern facilities for the bottling of ice tea, juice drinks, juices and flavored water and provides sufficient opportunities for capacity expansions and growth initiatives going forward. Refresco also expanded capabilities at its Recoaro site to further optimize its footprint in Italy and acquired land and building in Keighley, UK, including a water well to tap into this growing category. In the U.S., Refresco invested in a new high-speed carton line. In addition to normal maintenance investments, Refresco invested in further efficiencies by replacing fillers and other production line components across its businesses. Furthermore, Refresco continued to roll-out its continuous improvement program PEX focused on helping to drive leadership development 110 ----- and to advance standardized activities and processes across Refresco. As a result UK and Poland received their first PEX certificates, Benelux was re-certified and Refresco started to roll-out the PEX program in the U.S. In 2016, capital expenditures spending was A87.7 million, comprising of investments in the installation of two A-PET lines, one low-acid line and three PET filling lines in the Benelux, UK, Poland, Spain and Italy, respectively. In 2015, capital expenditure spending was A80.8 million, primarily attributable to investments in a new warehouse facility in Gr¨unsfeld, Germany and new A-PET bottling lines in France and invested in additional A-PET capacity in the UK, Italy and Poland.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, Refresco re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognized at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognized in profit or loss. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of Refresco’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit (‘‘CGU’’) and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained. Refresco assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, Refresco estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized in the income statement in expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset, except for properties previously revalued with the 111 ----- revaluation taken to OCI. For such properties, the impairment is recognized in OCI up to the amount of any previous revaluation. _Other Intangibles_ Software acquired by Refresco is measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only to the extent that it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Amortization is recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, generally 3 years. Brands acquired, separately or as part of a business combination, are capitalized if they meet the definition of an intangible asset and the recognition criteria are satisfied. Brands acquired as part of a business combination are valued at fair value based on the relief from royalty method. Brands are amortized on an individual basis over the estimated useful life of the brand. Customer and sales channel-related and contract-based intangibles are capitalized if they meet the definition of an intangible asset and the recognition criteria are satisfied. The relationship between brands and customer and sales channel-related intangibles is carefully considered so that brands and customer and sales channel-related intangibles are not both recognized on the basis of the same cash flows. Customer and sales channel-related and contract-based intangibles acquired as part of a business combination are valued at fair value and amortized over the period of the contractual arrangements or the remaining useful life of the customer relationships.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognized in profit or loss with the exception of monetary items that are designated as part of the hedge of the Refresco’s net investment of a foreign operation. These are recognized in other comprehensive income (‘‘OCI’’) until the net investment is disposed of, at which time, the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those monetary items are also recorded in OCI. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item i.e. translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognized in OCI or profit or loss are also recognized in OCI or profit or loss, respectively. _Foreign operations_ The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into euros at the exchange rate at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into euros at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions (or at an average rate if this is not an unreasonable approximation). Foreign currency differences arising thereon are recognized, in OCI, in the foreign currency translation reserve. When a foreign operation is disposed of, either in part or in full, the associated cumulative amount in the foreign currency translation reserve is transferred to profit or loss as an adjustment to the profit or loss on disposal. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of the net investment in the foreign operation and are recognized in other comprehensive income in the foreign currency translation reserve. 112 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Refresco seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to minimize the effects of fluctuations of foreign currencies and interest rates in the profit or loss. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. The method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Refresco applies cash flow hedge accounting. Refresco documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. Refresco also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized in the income statement immediately. When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when it is recognized. In other cases the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred to the same line of profit or loss in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss. Where the financial instruments are held to hedge foreign currency purchases of raw materials and consumables, the changes are included in raw materials and consumables used. Where the instruments are held to hedge interest rate risk exposure, the changes are included in finance income and expense. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued. The cumulative unrealized gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity, is recognized in profit or loss immediately, or when a hedging instrument is terminated. If the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in other comprehensive income and is recognized in accordance with the above-mentioned policy when the transaction occurs. The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 3.3 of the Refresco Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. Movements of the hedging reserve in other comprehensive income are shown in note 5.8 of the Refresco Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Refresco has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. For defined contribution plans, Refresco pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. Refresco has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available. 113 ----- _Defined benefit plans_ A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan. Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognized in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates on government bonds are used. For pension plans whereby a limit on the employer’s future contribution to the pension plans exist, Refresco will reflect this limit in its calculations. For these plans, Refresco will apply a liability cap in case the present value of the future service cost exceeds the present value of the future maximum employer contributions and the defined benefit obligation exceeds the asset value. The liability cap does not exceed the difference between the defined benefit obligation and the asset value. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past-service costs are recognized immediately in income. _Multi-employer plans_ Refresco also facilitates multi-employer plans, in which various employers contribute to one central pension union. In accordance with IAS 19R, as the pension union managing the plan is not able to provide Refresco with sufficient information to enable Refresco to account for the plan as a defined benefit plan, Refresco accounts for its multi-employer defined benefit plan as if it were a defined contribution plan. _Other long-term employee benefits_ The net obligation in respect of long term employee benefits other than pension plans is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any related assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the obligations of Refresco. The calculation is performed using the projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. _Termination benefits_ Termination benefits are employee benefits provided in exchange for the termination of an employee’s employment as a result of either an entity’s decision to terminate an employee’s employment before the normal retirement date; or an employee’s decision to accept an offer of benefits in exchange for the termination of employment. A liability is recognized at the earlier of the following dates: when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and when the entity recognizes costs for a restructuring and involves the payment of termination benefits. _Short term benefits_ Short term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if Refresco has a legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be reliably estimated. 114 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

The Cott TB Acquisition was completed to address expected retailer brands market growth in the U.S. driven by the expansion of discounters, the expanding footprint of online retailers and macro factors. Cott TB is well established in the retailer brands segment with more than 85% of its bottling activities being for world leading retailers. Cott TB also operates in the contract manufacturing segment. Cott TB has three reporting segments: Cott TB North America, Cott TB UK and Cott TB Mexico.

Industry-wide CSD sales declined during the periods under review, which had an overall impact on volumes. Cott TB experienced distinct trends in its three segments. _Cott TB North America_ Cott TB North America’s retailer brands volumes declined but were replaced by contract manufacturing volumes during the periods under review. Overall, Cott TB North America’s volumes were largely stable between 2015 and 2017, experiencing a decline of 4.6%, or 143.3 million liters, from 3,137.7 million liters in 2015 to 2,994.4 million liters in 2017. The retailer brands business was responsible for the decline, with volumes reducing by approximately 219 million liters between 2015 and 2017. The decrease in retailer brands volumes was offset by Cott TB North America’s shift towards contract manufacturing, which grew from 385.0 million liters to 427.1 million liters between 2015 and 2017, supported by new customer acquisitions (such as Monster and Campbell). Cott TB’s acquisition of Pri-Pak, which was completed in April 2017 had a positive impact on Cott TB North America’s contract manufacturing volumes in the financial year ended 2017. _Cott TB UK_ The retailer brands market in the United Kingdom experienced a general decline similar to the market in North America largely due to decreases in the Sports & Energy and CSD segments, but Cott TB UK has 115 ----- not experienced a corresponding increase in contract manufacturing volumes. Cott TB UK’s volumes experienced a 16.3% decline between 2015 and 2017, decreasing by 171.7 million from 1,054.5 million liters to 882.8 million liters, in part, because of losses of certain contracts, resulting in a loss in market share which has primarily been captured by Refresco. _Cott TB Mexico_ Cott TB Mexico’s volume declined by 38% from 97.8 million liters in 2015 to 60.7 million liters in 2017.

The cost of these raw materials can fluctuate substantially over time for a variety of reasons, including based on fluctuations in demand for products and the timing of fruit-growing seasons. During the periods under review, Cott TB managed such exposures to fluctuations in ingredient and packaging costs to a limited extent by entering into fixed price commitments for a portion of its ingredient and packaging requirements and otherwise managed its exposure to such fluctuations by passing through the costs to customers through price increases.

During the periods under review, Cott TB maintained a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that its procurement activities would be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Cott TB entered into forward contracts to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These foreign currency contracts typically have maturities of less than twelve months. Further, changes to raw material costs driven by exchange rates can generally be passed on to the customers with a slight time delay, in the same way as fluctuations in raw materials prices, at the time a customer’s contract is renewed. _Translational_ Cott TB reports its consolidated financial statements in its functional currency, which is the U.S. dollar. As a result, the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of all of its operations with a currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollar at then applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar affect the value of these items with respect to the non-U.S. dollardenominated businesses in the consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. For example, a stronger U.S. dollar will reduce the reported results of operations of non-U.S. dollar businesses and conversely a weaker U.S. dollar will increase the reported results of operations of non-U.S. dollar businesses. These translation effects could significantly affect the comparability of Cott TB’s results between financial periods and/or result in significant changes to the carrying value of Cott TB’s assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity. In the periods under review, Cott TB’s reported financial performance is impacted by currency translation effects, particularly due to the depreciation of the British pound relative to the U.S. dollar.

This decrease was primarily due to lower intercompany sales of water to DSS Group Inc. (a subsidiary of Cott Corporation) as well as the result of higher contract manufacturing volumes, for which a tolling fee is received, and lower retailer brands volumes. Cott TB UK Cott TB UK’s revenue decreased by $15.9 million or 4.3% to $347.8 million in the financial year ended 2017 from $363.7 million in the financial year ended 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the variances between the U.S. dollar and British pound exchange rates during the period. Cott TB Mexico Cott TB Mexico’s revenue decreased by $3.2 million or 16.8% to $15.8 million in the financial year ended 2017 from $19.0 million in the financial year ended 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the loss of a significant contract but partially offset by the gain of a different contract. _Cost of sales_ Cost of sales increased by $6.3 million, or 0.4%, to $1,442.0 million in the financial year ended 2017 from $1,435.7 million in the financial year ended 2016. This increase was primarily due to increases in Cott TB UK’s cost of sales due to costs associated with extra waste, labor and repair costs due to quality issues with certain production lines, the write-off of certain inventory related to a product recall, increased quality testing costs, higher transport costs between locations due to the recall and losses of certain margins to two larger retailers in the United Kingdom. _Selling, general and administrative expenses_ Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $2.8 million, or 1.6%, to $171.0 million in the financial year ended 2017 from $173.8 million in the financial year ended 2016. This decrease was mainly caused by a decrease in the amount of corporate costs allocated by Cott Corporation to Cott TB in 2017. _Other (income) expense, net_ Other (income) expense, net changed to an expense of $21.0 million in the financial year ended 2017 from income of $1.7 million in the financial year ended 2016. This change was primarily due to losses related to 119 ----- the early repayment of senior notes due 2020 of Refresco Beverages U.S. Inc. (formerly Cott Beverages Inc.) in the first quarter of 2017, but was partially offset by currency exchange gains. _Interest Expense, net_ Interest expense, net decreased by $31.7 million, or 39.0%, to $49.5 million in the financial year ended 2017 from $81.2 million in the financial year ended 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the repayment of senior notes due 2020 in the first quarter of 2017. _Related party income and expense_ Related party interest income increased by $12.9 million, or 28.0%, to $58.9 million in the financial year ended 2017 from $46.0 million in the financial year ended 2016. This increase was primarily due to the assumption of a 6% note receivable with S. & D. Coffee, Inc. (a subsidiary of Cott Corporation) for $200 million in April 2017 and issuance of a new 5.75% note to DSS Group Inc. (a subsidiary of Cott Corporation) for $109.5 million by Refresco Beverages U.S. Inc. (formerly Cott Beverages Inc.). Related party interest expense increased by $37.5 million, or 139.9%, to $64.3 million in the financial year ended 2017 from $26.8 million in the financial year ended 2016. This increase was primarily due to the entry into a new 5.75% $750 million note by Refresco Beverages U.S. Inc. (formerly Cott Beverages Inc.) with its parent company in the first quarter 2017 (the proceeds of which were used to repay its senior notes due 2020 and issue the 5.75% note). Other related party income increased by $3.0 million, or 14.4%, to $23.9 million in the financial year ended 2017 from $20.9 million in the financial year ended 2016. This increase was primarily due to a lower dividend paid to Cott TB by a subsidiary of Cott Corporation. _Income Tax Expense_ Income tax expense changed to an income tax benefit of 13.0 million in the financial year ended 2017 from an income tax expense of $5.9 million in the financial year ended 2016. This change was primarily due to losses in Canada that favorably impacted tax rates. See note 5 to the Cott TB 2017 Carve-out Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. _Net income (loss)_ As a result of the factors described above, net income decreased to a loss of $28.9 million in the financial year ended 2017 from income of $5.8 million in the financial year ended 2016. _Net income attributable to non-controlling interests_ Net income attributable to non-controlling interests increased to $8.5 million in the financial year ended 2017 from $6.4 million in the financial year ended 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the amount of income received as owners of Northwest Retailer Brands LLC. _Net loss attributed to Cott TB_ As a result of the factors described above, Cott TB made a loss of $37.3 million in the financial year ended 2017 as compared to a loss of $0.5 million in the financial year ended 2016. 120 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

This decrease was primarily due to mix effect due to an increase in contract manufacturing volumes, for which a tolling fee is received, and lower retailer brands volumes and price decreases but was partially offset by an increase in added retailer brands water volumes. 121 ----- Cott TB UK Cott TB UK’s revenue decreased by $91.6 million or 20.1% to $363.7 million in the financial year ended 2016 from $455.3 million in the financial year ended 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the loss of a significant customer in the financial year ended 2016. This decrease was also attributable to variances between the U.S. dollar and British pound exchange rates during the period. Cott TB Mexico Cott TB Mexico’s revenue decreased by $6.7 million or 26.1% to $19.0 million in the financial year ended 2016 from $25.7 million in the financial year ended 2015.

Other related party income increase by $34.0 million, or 61.9%, to $20.9 million in the financial year ended 2016 from $54.9 million in the financial year ended 2015.

The asset, liabilities, revenues and expenses included in the Cott TB Carve-out Financial Statements represent only those that were sold to Refresco as well as certain allocated expenses as deemed appropriate by management of Cott Corporation as disclosed in the accompanying notes to the Cott TB Carve-out Financial Statements. See also ‘‘Summary—Recent Developments—The Cott TB _Acquisition.’’ The Cott TB Carve-out Financial Statements may not necessarily be indicative of the_ historical results that would have been obtained if the Cott Traditional Business had been a separate company during the periods presented or the results that may be obtained in the future. All intercompany balances and transactions within the Cott Traditional Business have been eliminated and transactions and balances between the Cott Traditional Business and Cott Corporation and its subsidiaries are reflected as related party transactions in the Cott TB Carve-out Financial Statements. Such transactions with Cott Corporation are no longer considered related party following the closing of the Cott TB Acquisition. See ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information.’’ Cott Corporation’s net investment in Cott TB (invested equity) includes the net assets of this business, as well as the accumulated earnings (losses) of Cott TB and transactions with Cott Corporation. The Cott TB Carve-out Financial Statements include the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses that are specifically identifiable to those sold to Refresco, as well as certain allocations as described below: _General Corporate Expenses_ Total corporate costs included in the Cott TB Carve-out Financial Statements, including the amounts allocated, amounted to $56.6 million for the financial year ended 2017. General corporate expenses are 126 ----- included in ‘‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’’ on the combined carve-out statement of operations. The costs associated with these general corporate costs have been allocated to the Cott TB using the most meaningful allocation methodologies, which were based primarily on time surveys (direct costs) and actual revenue (indirect costs). The general corporate expense allocations which were not directly or indirectly attributable to the Cott TB are primarily for legal, treasury, insurance, finance, internal audit, strategy and public affairs, and amounted to $7.8 million for the financial year ended 2017. The costs allocated are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if Cott TB had performed the functions as a stand-alone entity, nor are they indicative of costs that will be incurred in the future or as a member of the Group. _Stock-based Compensation_ For the financial year ended 2017, share-based compensation expense in the Cott TB’s combined carve-out statement of operations included Cott Corporation’s expenses related to the directly attributable fair value of awards held by certain employees of Cott TB during the periods presented. Additionally, there was an allocation for certain employees of Cott Corporation’s corporate function, calculated based on time studies and actual revenues. These expenses are not necessarily indicative of what the expenses would have been had Cott TB been a separate stand-alone company during the financial year ended 2017. _Retirement Plans_ During the financial year ended 2017, certain employees of Cott TB participated in pension plans sponsored and administered by entities included in the Cott Traditional Business. An attribution of assets and obligations, and an allocation of the related pension expenses, was reflected in the combined carve-out financial statements on the basis of historical amounts included within these reporting units. In the case of legal plan separations in the United States, the Employment Retirement Security Act of 1974 (‘‘ERISA’’) includes explicit guidance on how the plan assets must be allocated, which may differ from the preliminary allocation used in the Cott TB Carve-out Financial Statements. The amounts recorded in the Cott TB Carve-out Financial Statements and the finalized ERISA allocation could be materially different. _Interest Expense (Income) and Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs—Net_ Third-party long-term debt specific to Cott TB has been reflected in Note 13 to the Cott TB 2017 Carve-out Financial Statements. The interest expense included in the Cott TB Carve-out Financial Statements includes interest expense related to the long-term debt included in the balance sheet. In addition, certain legal entities of Cott Corporation outside Cott TB incurred third-party debt and provided intercompany financing to Cott TB. This financing is recognized in Cott TB’s combined carve-out balance sheet as of December 30, 2017 as amounts due to Cott Corporation within Related party notes payable and is interest-bearing as described in note 19 to the Cott TB 2017 Carve-out Financial Statements. As a result of this arrangement, the Cott TB Carve-out Financial Statements include related party interest expense (and interest payable) at the exchange amount, which is the amount established and agreed to by the related parties. Interest expense included in the Cott TB Carve-out Financial Statements is not necessarily indicative of the interest charges that would have been incurred had Cott TB functioned as a stand-alone company. In addition, historically, certain legal entities included in the Cott Traditional Business have incurred thirdparty debt and provided intercompany financing to other business units of Cott Corporation outside the Cott Traditional Business. This financing is recognized in Cott TB’s combined carve-out balance sheet as of December 30, 2017 as amounts due from Cott Corporation within Related party notes receivable and is interest-bearing as described in note 19 to the Cott TB 2017 Carve-out Financial Statements. As a result of this arrangement, the Cott TB Carve-out Financial Statements include related party interest income (and interest receivable) at the exchange amount. Interest income included in the Cott TB Carve-out Financial Statements is not necessarily indicative of the interest charges that would have been incurred had Cott TB functioned as a stand-alone company. 127 ----- _Income Taxes_ Income taxes are calculated as if all of operations of Cott TB had been a series of separate taxpaying legal entities, filing separate tax returns in their local tax jurisdiction. Accordingly, the tax provision for the Cott TB Carve-out Financial Statements was prepared using the separate-return method, in which taxable income or loss is calculated as if the carve-out operations represented a taxable group that is separate from the existing parent. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax attributes and related deferred taxes associated with the legal entities that the combined carve-out financial statements comprise, as well as adjustments arising from any cost allocations recorded as part of the carve-out process. Certain income tax balance sheet items included in the Cott TB Carve-out Financial Statements are adjusted through Net Parent Investment and thus do not necessarily reflect Cott TB as a stand-alone company. _Intangible Assets_ Cott Corporation has directly attributed historical intangible assets to Cott TB based on the historical carrying amounts attributed to Cott TB. With respect to all intangible assets, this attribution of specifically identifiable intangible assets to Cott TB is not necessarily indicative of the fair value allocated to the intangible asset by Refresco upon the completion of the Cott TB Acquisition. _Goodwill_ Cott Corporation has directly attributed historical goodwill to Cott TB based on the historical goodwill amounts attributed to Cott TB. No goodwill allocation was required as the carved-out entities already held their own historical goodwill amounts when combined to form Cott TB. This goodwill attribution is not necessarily indicative of the fair value allocated to goodwill by Refresco upon the completion of the Cott TB Acquisition. _Earnings Per Share_ Cott TB is not a separate legal entity with common shares outstanding. Therefore, historical earnings per share have not been presented in the Cott TB Carve-out Financial Statements. 128 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

As the number of variables and assumptions affecting the possible future resolution of uncertainties increases, those judgments become even more subjective and complex. In order to provide an understanding of how Cott TB’s has prepared its carve-out financial statements, including the variables and assumptions underlying its estimates, and the sensitivity of those judgments to different circumstances, Cott TB has identified the significant accounting policies discussed below. While Cott TB believes that all aspects of its financial statements should be studied and understood in assessing its current and expected financial condition and results of operations, it believes that the following significant accounting policies warrant particular attention.

We do not have any significant concentration of credit risk. In order to reduce the exposure to credit risk, we carry out ongoing credit evaluations of the financial position of customers but generally does not require collateral. Use is made of a combination of independent ratings and risk controls to assess the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors. Sales are subject to payment conditions which are common practice in each country. The banks and financial institutions used as counterparty for holding cash and cash equivalents and deposits and in derivative transactions can be classified as high credit quality financial institutions (institutions that receive a minimum of an A rating from Standard & Poor’s).

213_2,Offerings 2018.md,866,LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES,866.8,Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Financial Risk,866.8.3,Market Risk,"_Foreign Currency Risk_ We are exposed to currency risk mainly on purchases denominated in U.S. dollars. At any point in time we aim to hedge 80% to 100% of its foreign currency exposure on contracted forecasted purchases. Following the Cott TB Acquisition, we are in the process of covering our exposure from taking U.S. dollars out of our North American operations. We use currency option contracts and forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risks, most of which have a maturity date of less than one year from the reporting date. When necessary, foreign currency contracts are rolled over on maturity. In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, we attempt to ensure that our net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates, as necessary, to address short term imbalances. In order to minimize the impact of accounting mismatches in the profit or loss account, we apply cash flow hedge accounting. The effectiveness of the hedge relationship is measured based on changes in intrinsic value of options and fair value of forward contracts. The changes in time value of the currency options are directly recorded in the income statement, as part of raw material costs. Per year-end the cash flow hedge accounting relationships were fully effective. There are no forecasted transactions for which hedge accounting has been applied, but which are no longer expected to occur. _Interest Rate Risk_ We are exposed to the effects of variable interest rates on interest-bearing long term liabilities, which is partly offset by cash held at variable rates. On fixed interest receivables and liabilities, we are exposed to market value fluctuations. For certain variable interest rate long term liabilities, Refresco has entered into 131 ----- interest rate swap agreements through which Refresco effectively pays fixed interest rates on these liabilities. We apply cash flow hedge accounting to offset the profit or loss impact resulting of timing differences between variable interest rate liabilities and the interest rate swap. Throughout 2015, 2016 and 2017 as well as at year-end the cash flow hedge accounting relationships in respect of Refresco were effective. _Price Risk_ We are exposed to commodity price risks. To manage these risks procurement operates within the framework of centrally specified policies and guidelines and must act in conformance with the required internal control measures. Our contract positions are based on a thorough understanding of the raw material markets and in principle contracted sales are covered back-to-back. We centralize the procurement of raw materials, packaging materials and indirect spend for Europe and North America. Authority levels of local management have been shifted towards our central procurement organization which is executing and monitoring the main contracts and important purchase decisions. Commodities are only purchased locally after approval of the central purchasing department. Contracts exceeding predefined limits must be authorized by the Executive Board. Existing contract positions are closely monitored and, when necessary, corrective actions are evaluated and implemented. To enable us to stay in line with developments in the raw materials markets and maintain its gross margins, it implements pass-on clauses into sales contracts with customers. In parallel, the quality of management information has been enhanced by the development of a network enabling knowledge of markets, suppliers and conditions of raw materials to be shared at the operating group level. We hedge the raw material aluminum through derivatives. _Pension Risk_ Refresco contributes to a number of defined benefit plans that provide pension benefits to employees upon retirement in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Belgium and the UK. The amount of the benefits depends on age, salary and years of service. Furthermore, Refresco has an indemnity plan in France and obligations for jubilee plans in the Netherlands, Germany and France. The financial figures are affected by the market interest rates and fair value of listed bonds and equity shares included in plan assets. Cott TB also maintains three defined benefit (‘‘DB’’) plans acquired as a part of prior acquisitions. One DB plan covers certain employees at one plant in the United States under a collective bargaining agreement and is referred to as the U.S. Plan. Two of these DB plans cover certain employees of Cott TB in the UK and are referred to collectively as the UK Plans. Retirement benefits for employees covered by the U.S. Plans and UK Plans are based on years of service multiplied by a monthly benefit factor. Pension costs are funded in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law. All DB plans are closed to new participants and are frozen.

Soft drinks are sold to end-consumers through two main channels: on-trade and off-trade. On-trade consists of sales through restaurants, bars, cafes, hotels and catering businesses. The on-trade channel sells primarily branded products. Off-trade consists of sales through retail outlets such as supermarkets, discounters, small grocers and other retail formats. Our products are primarily sold through off-trade channels. Although some of the products we produce for contract manufacturing customers may be sold through on-trade channels, given the significantly larger size of the off-trade market compared to the on-trade market and our strong focus on customers in the off-trade channel, only off-trade data will be referenced in this section. In 2016, the total European Soft Drinks Market and the North American Soft Drinks Market volume was approximately 225 billion liters in off-trade (branded products and retailer brands) sales and that market volume is expected to grow to approximately 237 billion liters by 2021, representing a CAGR of 1.1% which is an increase of 0.6% from 2011 to 2016 according to GlobalData, 2017.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

CSDs exclude carbonated bottled water, still drinks and RTD tea. _Fruit and Vegetable Juice_ Fruit and vegetable juice comprises juice not from concentrate (‘‘NFC’’) and juice reconstituted from frozen concentrate, and nectars. Nectars are produced using a base of concentrated juice or a pasteurized pur´ee of fruit pulp, to which sugar and water can be added, and contain 10% to 99% juice. _Bottled Water_ Bottled water comprises still and sparkling water, including flavored and functional water. Flavored water typically contains a very limited quantity (amount to approximately one gram per liter) of fruit juice or essence. Functional water is water which has been fortified or enhanced with nutrients, vitamins, oxygen or herbs. _Sports and Energy Drinks_ Sports drinks (including isotonic, hypotonic and hypertonic sports drinks) usually depend on the provision of fluids, carbohydrates or both. Energy drinks are designed to boost energy levels and usually contain high levels of caffeine and taurine. 133 ----- _Dilutables_ Dilutables comprise concentrates, syrups and squashes. They must be diluted with water before consumption. The largest category is bottled water, which accounted for approximately 50% of the total retail sales volume in the European Soft Drinks Market in 2016, followed by CSDs and fruit and vegetable juice, with 27% and 5%, respectively. Dairy is generally not considered a category of the soft drinks market according to GlobalData, 2017. In the North American Soft Drinks Market, a slightly different distribution is visible in 2016, with CSDs accounting for approximately 37%, followed by bottled water and juice with 33% and 6%, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623
213_2,Offerings 2018.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.1,The Off-Trade European Soft Drinks Market and North American Soft Drinks Market,521.1.3,Key Trends,"_Health and Nutrition Awareness_ Consumers are increasingly reducing the intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, which has created a shift in demand towards healthier alternatives. This recent trend is a consequence of a growing concern around lifestyle-related diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, cholesterol as well as a growing number of programs in place to raise consumers’ awareness. Spurred by recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO), the EU member states have agreed by 2020 to reduce the volume of so-called added sugar in the overall marketed volume of food by 10% as compared to 2015, which would imply higher sugar taxes. In the U.S., sugar taxes have been introduced in several cities, which has required certain consumer packaged goods companies (‘‘CPGs’’) like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo to shift portfolio to lower sugar content (e.g. Light, Zero). At the same time, the threat of import tariffs has grown since the beginning of the Trump presidency. Higher import taxes could potentially lead to lower imports of soft drink products. Any changes in regulations or imposed taxes could soften consumer demand for products or lead companies to raise prices. In Europe, taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (‘‘SSBs’’) are likely to decrease volume growth. Thirteen European countries have already introduced SSBs taxes and more are considering them. Approximately 25% to 30% of a person’s daily sugar intake comes from soft drinks and juices. As such, governments have concluded that SSBs are an ideal place to target with taxes. The UK, Ireland, and Portugal announced they would introduce taxes on SSBs between 2017 and 2018, following the path set by Mexico, France, Finland, Hungary, and several cities in California. As a consequence to the overall increase in health awareness, consumers are moving towards healthier options such as waters, teas and alternative still beverages while reducing their consumption of SSBs. We also believe that consumers perceive that ‘‘what is natural is healthy,’’ which causes artificial ingredients to come under attack, thus forcing the continuous label changes (clean labels). A company’s ability to quickly respond to market trends allows it to innovate their recipes formulas and continue to meet consumer needs. For example, manufacturers have responded to the health conscientiousness trend by using sucralose instead of sugar or CSDs that are preservative free and with no added sugar. Companies are also increasing their innovation capabilities and making their facilities as flexible as possible in order to adapt their products to customer needs in a quick time to market. High-growth pockets remain within the soft drinks category, with sports/energy drinks, RTD tea and bottled water projected to have faster growth than the broader market. _Time Compression_ Increasing time constraints are having an important impact on consumer behavior and segment shift. This is due to changes in consumer lifestyles leading to a reduction of time spent at home. Another factor is the increase in proportion of households where both spouses are employed, thus reducing meal preparation time. The increasing household fragmentations are also impacting the market demand. As a consequence, there is an increasing demand for convenient and portable products. Consumers want to have access to on the go packaging with single-serve portions. Furthermore, consumers are also seeking to reduce the preparation time required for a meal and focusing on buying their groceries online and at discounters. Frequent and smaller top up shopping trips are also becoming more prevalent. 134 ----- _Budget Constraints_ There is a polarization among consumers within the sector as some of them trade down to less expensive product categories while some of them trade up to exclusive products with perceived benefits. Some consumers switched over to lower product categories to save money, including reducing soft drink consumption due to budget constraints. Consumer confidence, however, has been improving with the rise of real incomes. Premiumization is also a growing trend as some consumers are more selective, choosing exclusive products with perceived benefits, such as health or energy drinks. Deluxe waters and tonics are increasingly available on the high-street and there is an increasing willingness to pay higher prices for better quality or functionality. For example, there is a niche but growing interest in ‘‘craft’’ sodas, reflecting a transition into mainstream. Finally, the demand for functional beverages is driving specialty and premium drinks as the functional drinks segment is forecast to grow over the next five years. _Sustainability_ Environmental concerns are a major factor impacting consumer behavior as a growing number of consumers are becoming aware of the environmental challenges faced by the global community. Consumer awareness of issues such as food and packaging waste and global warming is spreading and has been impacting consumer purchasing behavior. Customers are increasingly aware of avoiding food and packaging waste when making shopping decisions. In comparison, increasingly stringent rules for businesses are forcing companies to take into account the overall environmental impact of their activity and adapt their sourcing and packaging items for example. This means that soft drinks producers need to be innovative and efficient in their approach to bottling the products in order to comply with the highest environmental standards.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

This has been driven by industry consolidation and geographic expansion among supermarkets that are increasingly requiring their suppliers to have similar geographic span and production capabilities. Regional supermarkets tend to look for independent retailer brands manufacturers with local production capacity and ability to meet their product requirements. While brand owners manufacture the majority of branded products themselves, some brand owners outsource the production of their branded products to contract manufacturers. There are various reasons for this, such as outsourcing by larger groups of low volume brands that are too small to produce in-house, outsourcing by small brand owners that lack scale to produce in-house, and outsourcing of peak or contingency volumes.

It is a resilient category that attracts consumers during a downturn but is also able to generate loyalty due to product quality. Fundamental growth is present because customers perceive retailer brands as high quality viable alternatives with better value for money. Consumer demand drives the retailer brands assortment and the expansion of advertising has a positive impact on growth. In addition, A-brand promotions are forecasted to reduce in intensity. Another positive dynamic is the increasing number of discounters with the launch of new store formats and innovation in drinks or packaging types. Discounters are still gaining share from traditional retailers in a number of geographies. Lastly, overall diversification and increased presence of retailer brands in higher growth categories offsets the short-term decline of segments such as juice with historically high share of retailer brands. While Aldi has been present for some time, discount stores are still under-represented in the U.S., creating an opportunity for Lidl and for existing operators, including Aldi, to expand. Going forward, the growing presence of discounters is expected to have a positive effect on retailer brands penetration. Aldi is currently investing in expanding its store network and Lidl opened its first stores in 2017 and aims to open 100 stores over the course of its first full year of presence in the U.S. Additionally, Aldi’s growth and Lidl’s market entrance is encouraging other retailers to embrace retailer brands as part of their strategy.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

However, the growth rate is expected to be lower than in the last few years. 138 ----- - Supermarkets are expanding and re-launching their retailer brands product lines. Supermarkets in the Netherlands look to the Albert Heijn group’s retailer brands penetration as a benchmark and aim to grow their respective market shares accordingly. In addition, retailers have launched re-vamped lines, such as Albert Heijn’s ‘Basics’ range, Superunie’s OKA range and Colruyt’s Bon Selection line. - Brand promotions are expected to reduce in intensity. _Germany_ - Discounters are expected to grow their market share with the launch of new store formats. - We expect that product categories with high retailer brands penetration, such as juice, will continue to decline. However, the rate of decline is expected to be lower than in the past few years. Bottled water, which has a low retailer brands penetration, is expected to grow. - Supermarkets are expected to continue to strive to increase sales of their retailer brands products by increasing their retailer brands assortment and increasing advertising for retailer brands products. _France_ - It is expected that there will be a further increase of large supermarkets at the expense of discounters. This will have a negative impact on the retailer brands market as discounters have higher retailer brands penetrations. - Discounters increased their market share until 2010, but have since suffered from an end-consumer trend towards higher-quality products. In addition, retailers have responded to end-consumer preferences and successfully parried the discounters’ business model. One strategy has been to lower the prices of high quality branded products. - Like-for-like retailer brands penetration is expected to continue to be negatively affected, mainly driven by a decrease of retailer brands penetration at discounters. However, this is partly offset by large retailers which are expected to have a slight increase in retailer brands penetration due to the launch of new premium retailer brands products and the decline of brand promotions. _Iberia_ - The retailer mix is expected to shift away from supermarkets towards discounters, (including full service retail chains with high retailer brands shares such as Mercadona), convenience stores and smaller retailers. - After 2008, retailer brands’ market share grew as a result of the economic recession. This was because retailer brands provided an attractive option for end-consumers with tight household budgets and this trend has not reversed during the economic recovery. In addition, retailers and discounters are expected to continue to address end-consumer preferences by expanding retailer brands product ranges and improving the quality of their retailer brands products. _Italy_ - Discounters are expected to continue to grow their market share to the detriment of traditional retailers and convenience stores. However, the growth rate is expected to be slightly lower than in the last few years. - The bottled water category (which has a low retailer brands penetration compared to other soft drinks categories) is growing at a faster pace than other soft drinks categories. After 2008, retailer brands market share grew due to as a result of the economic recession because retailer brands provided a cheaper option for end-consumers with tight household budgets. End-consumers now perceive retailer brands as a high quality viable option, thus raising expected future growth. In addition, supermarkets and discounters are expected to continue to address end-consumer preferences by expanding retailer brands product ranges and improving the quality of the existing retailer brands products. _UK_ - Discounters are expected to continue to gain market share and supermarkets are expected to lose market share. 139 ----- - After declining since 2011, the highly penetrated category of juice has begun to stabilize, and the negative volume effect on retailer brands product lines is expected to slow. - Like-for-like retailer brands penetration is expected to slow its historic decline. The decline reflects the stagnation of retailer brands product offerings. However, with all players engaged in a price war, retailer brands products offer a chance for increased margins and differentiation and are expected to regain priority status. _Poland_ - Retailer brand market declined (�3.0%) CAGR in 2011-16A, despite overall soft drinks market growing at 2.3% CAGR during that period. - Decline led by fall in CSD, Packaged Water and Dilutables consumption (�10.5%, �3.5% and �10.3% CAGRs, respectively), somewhat offset by growth in Juice (17.4% CAGR). _Finland_ - Retailer brand market flat (�0.0%) CAGR in 2011-16A, despite overall soft drinks market declining at �1.8% CAGR during that period. - Fall in Juice consumption (�11.0% CAGR), offset by growth in Energy Drinks and Packaged Water (32.2% and 8.8% CAGRs, respectively). _North America_ - Penetration of retailer brands is expected to grow, driven by expansion of Aldi and Lidl in the U.S., the ongoing consolidation of the food retail landscape, and the large retailers improving their retailer brand offering, in response to renewed pressure from discounters. - Water, the most penetrated category for retailer brands, is expected to continue to lead retailer brand growth, due to the overall shift in consumption and relatively limited pressure from branded players, both of which negatively affect categories such as CSDs and juice. 140 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

213_2,Offerings 2018.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.11,Contract Manufacturing,521.11.1,Overview,"The contract manufacturing market is split between various groups of branded players and is increasingly commonplace among the three main categories or product types of A-brand owners: large groups players, large new entrants and local players. Ongoing structural market trends are also leading to an increase in the contract manufacturing market: - limited branded growth, product fragmentation and pressure on branded margins and increased focus on returns. The flat branded market in Europe is partly explained by the market share gain of retailer brands putting pressure on efficiency gains and focusing on growth in faster-growing niche categories; - consumers are looking for more differentiated offerings resulting in more product and packaging innovations; and - pressure on branded margins and increased focus on returns on branded margins and overall profitability of A-brand owners led to increased attention to more value creating activities, such as marketing. Increased investor scrutiny on capital allocation also continues to drive brand owners’ focus on returns. 141 ----- The outsourcing decision is mainly triggered by an asset-light strategy, brand-focus, operational efficiency and risk volatility and management: - **Asset-light strategy: Established A-Brands and newer market entrants both in the United States and in Europe are increasingly implementing an asset-light strategy whereby they outsource a majority of their production and distribution while focusing on more profitable businesses and branding. These trends are leading to the outsourcing of additional volumes. - Established A-brands are increasingly focused on an ‘‘asset-light’’ strategy given the lower returns on manufacturing investment than in core marketing activities. Larger brands and products may still be effectively produced in-house through lean manufacturing. Increasingly, A-brands are pursuing even more asset-light strategies. For instance, Coca-Cola sold its manufacturing and distribution assets in the United States to focus on its more profitable concentrate-making business. Other established A-brands have announced similar strategies. The majority of volumes from A-brands are represented by the lower volume brands and products in their portfolio (e.g. Innocent, Tropicana), which are too small to be produced in-house. - Newer market entrants, on the other hand, are not spending on building out manufacturing or production facilities. Instead, they focus on investing in sales and marketing to create popular brands and outsource the production and distribution functions. - The proliferation of multiple brands and growth in packaging varieties, such as 250ml cans, has encouraged large bottlers to outsource to bottlers with greater production flexibility instead of investing in in-house production. - **Operational efficiency and operating expenditure: Specialist manufacturing businesses have greater opportunities and capabilities to utilize lines. Thus, branded players are increasingly looking for manufacturing players able to serve them throughout the footprint. These are typically large new entrants and local brand owners with low volume brands and products. There are also brands which lack the scale to produce in-house, with Monster, Ferrero and Arizona being prominent examples. - **Risk volatility and management: A-brands experience uncertainty and variability of volumes experienced by A-brands, requiring flexibility and the necessity of back-up capacity for either peak demand or breakdowns. When a contract is gained with larger brands or products, such as Coca Cola or PepsiCo, additional contracts usually follow. For example, the Innocent contracts came through as a result of a proven relationship with Coca-Cola and Naked contracts came through as a result of a proven relationship with PepsiCo. This was also the case for Tropicana and 7-up, which were products of the PepsiCo relationship.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Juices may benefit from a repositioning as a cold-pressed fresh product, while nectars also continue to add volume.

213_2,Offerings 2018.md,521,INDUSTRY OVERVIEW,521.11,Contract Manufacturing,521.11.4,Key trends,"Manufacturers of branded soft drinks have increasingly outsourced the production of some of their products. The reasons for outsourcing vary from providing for contingency volumes to enabling brand owners to focus resources on product development and advertising. This trend continues to accelerate. The branded product range is growing increasingly fragmented, as end-consumers look for more differentiated offerings, resulting in more product and packaging innovations and a growing share of lower volume brands and product lines. As a result of increasing cost pressures (such as increasing costs in raw materials, packaging materials and energy), the manufacturers of branded soft drinks must manage their cost base proactively. In addition, demand for branded soft drinks is flat, partly due to the share gain of retailer brands products, thus putting additional pressure on efficiency gains. As a result, manufacturers of branded soft drinks are expected to increasingly outsource part of their production to third-party bottlers in order to ensure manufacturing efficiency and enable capital allocation towards marketing and sales activities. When outsourcing, brand owners typically look for manufacturers with high quality standards, sufficient scale and geographic scope. Manufacturers must be able to provide both production flexibility and reliability and also meet their requirements in a multitude of markets. It is expected that the volume of contract manufacturing as part of European soft drinks off-trade volumes (excluding water) will continue to increase.

In the U.S., consumption per capita is approximately 381 liters per year on average, whereas consumption per capita is approximately 206 liters per year in Western Europe, approximately 169 liters per year in Latin America, approximately 70 liters per year in China and approximately 42 liters per year in the rest of Asia. 145 ----- From 2016 to 2021, volume in the North American Soft Drinks Market, is expected to increase at a rate of 1.4% per year. Between 2011 and 2016, volume grew at approximately 1.0% per year according to GlobalData, 2017. The European Soft Drinks Market is the second largest market globally with an annual consumption of 102 billion liters. Volumes are expected to increase by 0.7% per year from 2016 to 2021, compared to 0.2% per year from 2011 to 2016. Our largest market within Europe in terms of volume is the UK, where volume growth has been relatively flat between 2011 and 2016 but is expected to grow at a forecasted CAGR of 0.8% from 2016 to 2021 according to GlobalData, 2017. Furthermore, the UK is expected to contribute 13% to the European Soft Drinks Market’s volume by 2021 according to GlobalData, 2017. We expect that contract manufacturing will be the key growth driver for us in the short-term with strong underlying structural drivers supporting long-term growth. We are the largest contract manufacturing player in both the European Soft Drinks Market and the North American Soft Drinks Market, with our contract manufacturing operations generating approximately 30% of our combined volume in 2017. We have also entered into contract manufacturing of water and mineral water, which we believe provides us with an additional opportunity for growth. Historically, contract manufacturing volumes have grown slightly faster than expected due to increased outsourcing. A-brands have increasingly focused on asset-light strategies and look to outsource non-core bottling processes. Further, the market has evolved to a point where a large number of small brands and independent manufacturers are creating successful brands (e.g. Arizona, Monster), which generally lack bottling capabilities and outsource the bottling and fill function. The proliferation of multiple brands and packaging varieties, such as 250ml cans, has encouraged large bottlers to outsource, especially for small volume, to bottlers with greater production flexibility. The industry has also seen a trend of volume shifting away from CSD to juices and still drinks, which are typically lower volume products and are therefore more likely to be outsourced. Additionally, high-growth functional beverages, such as enhanced waters and iced teas, that require greater sophistication in the beverages production process. The production process for these categories chiefly uses aseptic PET (‘‘A-PET’’) filling technology in Europe and hot-fill technology in the U.S., requiring high capital investment and expertise to properly operate, and as a result are often outsourced. We expect these trends to continue driving growth going forward.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

This combination provides us with several structural competitive advantages. Our business model positions us to take advantage of growth trends in the European Soft Drinks Market and North American Soft Drinks Market as both the retailer brands and contract manufacturing segments are expected to grow between 2017 and 2021. In addition, our focus on retailer brands and contract manufacturing means that, other than for specialty regional drink products, we have limited competition with A-brands, which provides us with an advantage when competing for outsourced branded volumes as compared to the manufacturing and bottling subsidiaries of large A-brand owners that are direct competitors. This is beneficial because the long-term nature of contract manufacturing contracts adds resilience, stability and predictability to our business. A-brand owners are outsourcing the manufacturing of their new and lower volume products because of the increased production complexity as a result of product and packaging diversification. We are able to manufacture these volumes using our optimized plant/line specialization, and reduce overall complexity and switch-over costs as these volumes are relatively large in comparison to our retailer brands product portfolio. Our global platform gives us an advantage because we can service our customers across all key product categories in Europe and North America and are differentiated from our competitors through our pan-European footprint and our national presence in the United States.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

The Cott TB Acquisition provides meaningful diversification to our customer base, reducing dependency on single accounts as well as consolidating A-brand customers. In 2017, on a standalone basis Refresco’s top 10 customers accounted for 58% of its volumes and Cott TB’s top 10 customers accounted for 66% of its volumes. Together, our top 10 customers accounted for 49% of our total combined volumes in 2017. We have longstanding relationships with our customers. Refresco has maintained relationships with 19 of its top 20 customers for over 15 years, which we believe is a testament to the high quality of our products and service. Further, Cott TB has maintained a strong relationship with Walmart for more than 20 years and, following the Cott TB Acquisition, it is now one of our largest customers. We build and maintain these relationships through customer integration, coordinating with our customers in areas such as supply chain (to minimize freight costs and reduce working capital requirements), new product development and packaging designs, market expertize (trends and opportunities) and customer service. The high level of customer integration coupled with our ability to provide a full range of soft drinks products and packaging increases our current and future customers’ dependence on our services, thus leading to long-lasting relationships. We believe that the complementary geographic locations of Cott TB will allow us to consolidate our customer relationships internationally, thus reinforcing partnerships and increasing customer reliance on our business, and thereby reducing the likelihood of potential account losses. Moreover, we will now be able to offer access to a global network, combining Refresco’s strong European capabilities and Cott TB’s strength in North America and the UK. We also believe that this combination will afford us the opportunity to grow alongside our existing European customers, Aldi and Lidl, as they expand in the U.S. We therefore believe that we are well-positioned to strengthen our relationships with our current customers, from both a geographic and product perspective and also to develop relationships with new customers, thus achieving additional utilization from our existing footprint.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

We are currently the number one retailer brands bottler and a leading contract manufacturer across Europe and North America by volume. As we evolved in scale, we gained greater awareness of achievable procurement and footprint optimization synergy opportunities throughout our business. One example is our combination with Gerber Emig, which demonstrated our extremely successful approach to consolidation. We were able to realize synergies from the transaction well ahead of our plan, mainly as a result of faster and higher than expected realization of procurement synergies. Our acquisition of Cott TB similarly offers a substantial synergy potential, particularly through scale benefits. Based on our strong track record of integrating acquisitions and realizing synergies, we expect to generate A34 million of savings through price harmonization and volume bundling, which we believe can be realized relatively quickly. We also believe we can achieve A22 million of operational synergies by optimizing footprint and operational efficiencies through the transfer of lines and manufacturing footprint rationalization. Lastly, we have targeted A6.8 million of achievable overhead synergies through headcount and office space lease reductions as we integrate and streamline our combined operation. Altogether, we anticipate total run-rate synergies of A62.8 million in the first three years following our consolidation, representing 4.3% of Cott TB’s 2017 revenue.

The first edition 161 ----- of Happy Awards resulted in 32 high quality project ideas from across the business units. The winning ideas focused on giving young people a change in the labor market (Italy), producing organic fruit juices in 100% recyclable carton packaging (France) and replacing road transport of NFC and concentrate juices with a sea-going barge from mainland Europe to the UK. In 2018, we plan to further embed responsibility into our operations. Until now we have applied our approach for our business units in Europe and starting from 2018 we aim also to begin roll out also in our operations in North America. 162 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Refresco and certain of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are organized in the Netherlands, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom are expected to 195 ----- become Post-Control Date Guarantors. Certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may be required to guarantee the Notes in the future under certain circumstances. Each Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will: - be senior subordinated obligations of that Guarantor; - be subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior indebtedness of that Guarantor, including that Guarantor’s guarantee of indebtedness incurred under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement; - rank _pari passu in right of payment with all of such Guarantor’s existing and future senior subordinated debt that is not subordinated in right of payment to its Note Guarantee; - rank senior in right of payment to all of such Guarantor’s future debt that is subordinated in right of payment to its Note Guarantee; - be secured by the Collateral; - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future debt of that Guarantor that is secured on a firstpriority basis by property or assets that secure the Note Guarantee on a second-priority basis (including obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement), or by property or assets that do secure the Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such obligations or indebtedness; - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt of such Guarantor’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes, including their obligations to trade creditors; and - be subject to limitations described herein and in ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the _Security Interests and Any Note Guarantees’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.’’_ Substantially all the operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries, generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not Guarantee the Notes. Although the Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, these limitations will be subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See ‘‘—Certain Covenants— _Limitation on Indebtedness.’’_ For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Issuer and the Post-Control Date Guarantors (as listed in clause (a) of the definition thereof) accounted for 65.4% of our pro forma Adjusted EBITDA.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

The ability to take enforcement action against the Guarantors under their Note Guarantees is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement and the terms of the Note Guarantees, and potentially any Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date. In addition, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral are subject to release under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, certain enforcement actions taken by the Security Agent acting at the direction of an instructing group of senior secured creditors. Because of the foregoing subordination provisions, it is likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors would recover disproportionately more than the holders of the Notes in any insolvency or similar proceeding relating to such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the principal of or interest on the Notes after the repayment in full of all Senior Indebtedness. The Note Guarantees will also be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, including payment blockage upon a senior default and standstill on enforcement.

By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time, if at all. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement places limitations on the ability of the Security Agent to cause the sale of some of the Collateral. These limitations may include requirements that some or all of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or certain other competitive sales processes or only at a price confirmed by a valuation, subject to certain exceptions.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control, or an offer or other transaction that if consummated would result in a Change of Control has been publicly announced and, if applicable, not withdrawn, at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 of the Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict. The occurrence of a change of control would entitle each lender under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (individually) to cancel its commitments and require prepayment of amounts outstanding to it under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement. Future debt of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may prohibit the Issuer from purchasing Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or requires repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to purchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the Issuer. 210 ----- If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days’ prior notice (provided that such notice is given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above) to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to the applicable Change of Control Payment plus, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Notes. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks _Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture and the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events and change of control events.’’_ The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of the phrase ‘‘substantially all’’ under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. In addition, the definitions of ‘‘Change of Control’’ and ‘‘Permitted Holders’’ expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Issuer in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

(2) all Indebtedness Incurred under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement to fund the Transactions on the Closing Date and/or the Completion Date or in connection with the applicable Squeeze-Out procedure shall be deemed Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant and may not be reclassified;

(9) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

and (11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance, costs and fees in connection with such refinancing. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this caption ‘‘—Limitation _on Indebtedness.’’ The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be calculated as_ specified under the definition of ‘‘Indebtedness.’’ If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date. For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the euro equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing; (b) the euro equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness, if denominated in euro, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the euro equivalent of such amount plus the euro equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement. 216 ----- For purposes of determining ‘‘Consolidated EBITDA’’ under the Indenture, Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured for the Issuer’s most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal consolidated financial statements are available as at the time that the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries obtains new commitments (in the case of revolving facilities) or Incurs new Indebtedness (in the case of term facilities or other Indebtedness). Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph within the applicable time period will be deemed to constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds’’ under the Indenture. Within 10 Business Days after the expiration of the applicable time period, or at such earlier date that the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds A30.0 million, the Issuer will be required to make an offer (‘‘Asset _Disposition Offer’’) to all Holders of Notes issued under the Indenture and, to the extent the Issuer elects,_ to other holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to, respectively, repay, prepay or purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes in minimum denominations of A100,000 and in integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof at an offer price equal to or greater than 100.0% of the principal amount of the Notes, and to repay, prepay or purchase any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be repaid, prepaid or purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repayment, prepayment or purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may make an Asset Disposition Offer prior to the expiration of the applicable time period referred to above. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid, prepaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such aggregate principal amounts into their euro equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into such currency. The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the ‘‘Asset Disposition Offer Period’’). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period, the Issuer will redeem (or procure the redemption of) the aggregate principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be repaid, prepaid or repurchased pursuant to this covenant (the ‘‘Asset _Disposition Offer Amount’’) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly_ tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall be permitted to delay the repayment, prepayment or purchase of Pari Passu Indebtedness until the last day of the first interest period ending at least 5 Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period. For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the Issuer or Indebtedness or other liability of a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and the release of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition; (2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer from the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; 228 ----- (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; provided that such Indebtedness is not, directly or indirectly, secured by any Lien on any of the assets or property of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer); (4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; (5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (i) A60.0 million and (ii) 15.0% of Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date of calculation (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); and (6) any Capital Stock or assets of a kind referred to in clause (3)(b) of the first paragraph of this covenant. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement contains, and future credit agreements or other similar agreements to which the Issuer (or one of its Restricted Subsidiaries) becomes a party may contain restrictions on the Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes. In the event an Asset Disposition occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the repurchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing Notes. In such a case, the Issuer’s failure to repurchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such other agreements.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

However, a Default under clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee security and/or indemnity (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; 244 ----- (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of such security and/or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) reasonably satisfactory to it against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 125 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 45 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute a Default, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an ‘‘Initial Default’’) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Reports’’ or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Notes provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of pre-funding) to its reasonable satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Transaction Security Documents except as provided in such Transaction Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast) (the ‘‘EU Insolvency Regulation’’), which became fully effective on 26 June 2017 and applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), the courts of the Member State in which a debtor’s ‘‘center of main interests’’ (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the center of main interests, or ‘‘COMI’’ of a ‘‘debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.’’ It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a rebuttable presumption that a debtor has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption shall only apply if the registered office of the legal person has not been moved to another Member State within the 3-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital (30) provides that it should be possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual center of management and supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other Member State Under the previous EU insolvency regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000), which defined the COMI in similar terms, the courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining a debtor’s COMI, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. If a debtor’s COMI is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another Member State. If a debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary (territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an ‘‘establishment’’ (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in the 3-month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings. An ‘‘establishment’’ is defined to mean ‘‘any place of operations where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to commence main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.’’ Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI, any proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment shall be secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, secondary insolvency 287 ----- proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the secondary insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of (i) a creditor which is domiciled, habitually resident or has its registered office in the other Member State or whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the _lex fori _concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency_ proceedings of the debtor. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets. The EU Insolvency Regulation provides for cooperation between (i) insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings, (ii) jurisdictions and (iii) jurisdictions and insolvency practitioners. It also provides for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part of the same group. Under Article 61 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary. As from June 26, 2018, the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings and, as from June 26, 2019, the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection of such insolvency registers.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623
213_2,Offerings 2018.md,867,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND ANY NOTE GUARANTEES,867.2,The Netherlands,867.2.1,Insolvency Proceedings,"The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are incorporated under Dutch law (the ‘‘Dutch Guarantors’’). Accordingly, where debtors have their ‘‘center of main interests’’ or an ‘‘establishment’’ in the Netherlands they may be subject to Dutch insolvency proceedings governed by Dutch insolvency laws, subject to certain exceptions provided for in the EU Insolvency Regulation. See ‘‘—European Union.’’ The Dutch insolvency laws may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the Dutch insolvency laws. Any insolvency proceedings applicable to the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors may be governed by Dutch insolvency laws. There are two insolvency regimes under Dutch law. The first, a suspension of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate the assets of a debtor and distribute the proceeds thereof to its creditors. In practice a suspension of payments often results in the bankruptcy of the debtor. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). Only the management board of the debtor can make an application for a suspension of payments, and only if it foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the application has been filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint one or more administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments.If a draft composition (ontwerp akkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium. If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted, 288 ----- unless a qualified minority (i.e., more than one-quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third of the number of creditors of the amount of claims held by creditors) of the unsecured, non-preferential, creditors declare against it or if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. That the debtor must be able to satisfy its creditors does not mean that they must be paid in full. It suffices that creditors can be satisfied to some extent (for example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within the framework of a composition). Other than in the case of the ordering by a competent court of a statutory stay of execution of up to two months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order pursuant to Article 241a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act, a suspension of payments will only affect unsecured, non-preferential creditors. During such stay of execution, a secured creditor may not, without the court’s consent (i) claim the asset subject to the security right if it is under the control of (in de macht van) the debtor subject to a suspension of payments or (ii) seek recourse against the asset. Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. Bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het _Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest_ (openbaar belang). In Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, a debtor’s assets are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors according to the relative priority of those creditors’ claims and, to the extent certain creditors’ claims have equal priority, in proportion to the amount of such claims. Certain parties, such as secured creditors, will benefit from special rights. Secured creditors, such as pledgees and mortgagees, may enforce their rights regardless of suspension of payments or bankruptcy and do not have to contribute to the liquidation costs; however, enforcement of the security right might be subject to the following: (a) a statutory stay of execution of up to two months extendable by another period of up to two months imposed by court order pursuant to Article 63a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet), which has the same effect as set forth above for stays of execution in suspensions of payment; (b) a receiver (curator) can force a secured party to foreclose its security right within a reasonable time (as determined by the receiver pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act), failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the relevant rights or assets and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of liquidation costs; and (c) excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the company’s receiver and may not be offset against an unsecured claim of the company’s secured creditor. Consequently, Dutch bankruptcy laws could reduce your potential recovery in Dutch bankruptcy proceedings. Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, where both secured and unsecured creditors are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims, suspension of payment and bankruptcy proceedings against the Issuer, Dutch bankruptcy law allows secured creditors (and in case of suspension of payments also preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities)) to satisfy their claims by proceeding against the assets (that secure their claims) as if there were no bankruptcy or suspension of payments. However, a statutory stay of execution of up to two months, extendable by another period of up to two months, may be declared applicable. Furthermore, certain preferred creditors have a preference by virtue of law. Unlike secured creditors, preferred creditors are not entitled to foreclose on assets of the bankrupt. They do have priority in the distribution of the proceeds of the bankrupt’s assets. Remaining amounts, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will—in principle—be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination will be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. However, the actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed. In exceptional circumstances, a compulsory plan of composition may limit the contractual subordination. Restrictions on the enforcement of security rights may apply. For instance, higher ranking rights must be respected. These may include secured creditors with a higher-ranking security right and tax and social security authorities. A statutory stay of execution of security rights and other rights of up to two months, extendable by another period of up to two months, may be imposed. Further, a receiver in bankruptcy can force a secured creditor to enforce its security right within a reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have a preferred claim in respect of the proceeds, meaning that the secured creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy costs, which may be significant. Excess proceeds of any enforcement must be returned to the bankrupt estate; they may not be set-off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor. Such set-off may be 289 ----- allowed prior to the bankruptcy, provided that there are no creditors with a security right, although there it may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set-off. Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by operation of law when suspension of payments is granted and terminate by operation of law when bankruptcy is declared. In addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the suspension of payments having become definitive, a composition having been ratified by the court or the declaration of bankruptcy (as the case may be) subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for such termination. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. Both in a definitive suspension of payments and bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is: (i) approved by a simple majority (gewone meerderheid) of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Since the unsecured and non-preferential creditors (including subordinated creditors) can vote on the composition plan and enforcement of security rights remains possible, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding or bankruptcy. Interest accruing after the date on which a suspension of payments or bankruptcy is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition. The claim of a creditor, other than a claim to the extent that it is secured by Dutch law security, may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Claims that fall due more than one year after the date of the bankruptcy, will be valued for distribution purposes as of the date the bankruptcy was declared. Claims that become payable within one year after the bankruptcy was declared will be considered payable from the day the bankruptcy was declared. All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims will have to be verified in the insolvency proceedings in order to be entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, to be entitled to distributions. ‘‘Verification’’ under Dutch law means, in the case of a suspension of payments, that the treatment of a disputed claim for voting purposes is determined and, in the case of a bankruptcy, the unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims are submitted to a receiver for verification, and the receiver then makes a determination as to the claim’s existence, ranking and value and whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings (for voting). In the situation of bankruptcy, creditors that wish to dispute the receiver’s verification of their claims will be referred to a claim validation proceeding (renvooiprocedure) in order to establish the amount and rank of the disputed claim, while in suspension of payments the court will decide how a disputed claim will be treated for voting purposes. These procedures could cause holders of Notes to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. The renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the holders of Notes to be delayed. Interest on the Notes accruing after the bankruptcy order date cannot be admitted unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro memoria, such as in case of the Notes. To the extent that an interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security, the creditor may not derive any rights from the admission. No interest is payable in respect of unsecured claims as of the date of a bankruptcy.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to have a secured claim, the documentation relating to the Notes will provide for the creation of a ‘‘parallel debt.’’ Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by Dutch law will directly secure the parallel debt.

Under Dutch law, any creditor of the Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor or its 290 ----- receiver (curator) may nullify any transaction or legal act entered into by the Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor in connection with the Notes, under certain circumstances, if (i) the transaction or legal act entered into by the Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor in connection with the Notes was conducted without a prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht); (ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of its or their bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of such transactions or legal act (irrespective of whether a creditor’s claim arose prior to or after such transactions); and (iii) at the time of the transaction or legal act entered into by the Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor in connection with the Notes was conducted (including the granting of the Guarantees or any security), the Issuer or relevant Dutch Guarantor and, unless the transactions were conducted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty knew or should have known that one or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio pauliana). A receiver (curator) may nullify a transaction on behalf of and for the benefit of the joint insolvent debtor’s creditors, and the burden of proof of the above mentioned elements of fraudulent conveyance in principle rests on the receiver. Knowledge of prejudice is, however, presumed by law for certain transactions performed within a ‘‘suspect period’’ of one year prior to an adjudication of bankruptcy. This is applicable for certain transactions only, the most important application being in cases where the obligations of the bankrupt materially exceed those of the other party, the satisfaction of existing obligations of the bankrupt that are not yet due, and acts between the bankrupt and its counterparty when the shares in both are held (indirectly) by the same shareholder or if the bankrupt and its counterparty are part of the same group of companies. The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer provisions outside a bankruptcy apply mutatis mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the receiver may challenge a transaction if it was conducted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the transaction was conducted at a time when the counterparty knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such transaction was conducted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the counterparty in order to give preference to the counterparty over the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any such transactions conducted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such a challenge would be successful. The application of Dutch law in respect of a Dutch law security interest in the Collateral will not prevent effect being given to the overriding provisions of the law of a jurisdiction with which the situation has a close connection (and for this purpose ‘‘overriding provisions’’ are provisions the respect for which are regarded as crucial by a jurisdiction for safeguarding its public interests to such an extent that they are applicable to any situation falling within their scope, irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to an agreement and include any rules (whether mandatory or not) that must be applied pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation) and will not prevent regard having to be had to the law of the jurisdiction in which performance takes place in relation to the manner of performance and the steps to be taken in the event of defective performance. In addition, enforcement of each Dutch law security interest in the Collateral (including allocation of the proceeds) is subject to Dutch law. Among other things, under Dutch law shares may only be transferred upon enforcement in accordance with Dutch law and the articles of association of the company in which shares are pledged at the time of enforcement. Rights of third parties acquiring a share or a limited right on a share and acting in good faith (te goeder trouw) may also affect the binding effect and enforceability of a Dutch law security interest in the Collateral. In proceedings before a Dutch court, security interests are in principle enforced through a public auction of the relevant assets in accordance with Dutch law. The Security Agent or the relevant security interest provider may request the competent court to approve a private sale of the secured assets, except when otherwise agreed. In the case of secured assets, the Security Agent and the security interest provider may agree to an alternative foreclosure procedure once the security right has become enforceable. The security interest providers have agreed to waive the right to request such alternative foreclosure procedure. The Security Agent may also request the competent court to determine that the secured assets shall accrue to it for a price determined by the court. In the case of a pledge, the right of the relevant security interest provider to request approval of a private sale may be excluded. It is not certain and has not been determined in published case law whether a right of pledge on shares can be created in advance of the acquisition of the shares by the pledgor.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Other general defenses include claims that a guarantee or security interest should be voided because it was entered into through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or error (dwaling). Other impeding factors include rights of suspension (opschorting), dissolution of a contract (ontbinding) and set off (verrekening). The enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer or a Dutch Guarantors may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction Act (Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions and in proceedings in a Dutch court for the enforcement of a Dutch law security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in respect of litigation, enforcement and collection costs. Furthermore, if the Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor enters into a transaction (such as the granting of a guarantee or security interest), the validity and enforceability of the relevant transaction may be contested by the Dutch company or its administrator (bewindvoerder) in a suspension of payments or its receiver (curator) in bankruptcy, if (i) that transaction is not in the company’s corporate interest (vennootschappelijk belang) and (ii) the other party to the transaction knew or should have known this without independent investigation. In determining whether the granting of a guarantee or the giving of security is in the interest of the relevant Dutch company, a Dutch court would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association of the company but also all relevant circumstances, including whether the company derives certain commercial benefits from the transaction in respect of which the guarantee or security interest was granted and any indirect benefit derived by the relevant Dutch company as a consequence of the interdependence of it with the group of companies to which it belongs and whether or not the subsistence of the relevant Dutch company is jeopardized by conducting such transaction. The mere fact that a certain legal act (rechtshandeling) is explicitly mentioned in the objects clause in the articles of association of the company may not be conclusive evidence to state that such legal act is in the corporate interests. As of October 1, 2012, the prohibition on financial assistance for a Dutch private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) was removed from Dutch law. In connection with such removal the legislator noted that the granting of security with a view to the acquisition (or the refinancing thereof) by any party of shares in the company’s share capital or the shares of its (direct or indirect) parent company could, depending on the further circumstances, constitute an ultra vires act.

This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. The ‘‘official exchange rate’’ for these purposes is the middle market rate at the London Foreign Exchange Market at the close of business as published for the date in question or, if no 292 ----- such rate is published, such rate as the court determines. Accordingly, in the event that an English Obligor goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date that such English Obligor went into liquidation or administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Notes may become entitled. There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of guarantees can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if the company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) of the granting of the guarantee. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, he may challenge the validity of the guarantee given by such company. The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to guarantees: _Transactions at an Undervalue_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the court for an order to set aside a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believes that such guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. It will only be a transaction at an undervalue if, at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the English company is insolvent (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act 1986, as amended). The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years from the date the English company grants the guarantee. A transaction might be subject to being set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person, if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. However, a court generally will not intervene if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (as defined in the U.K. Insolvency Act 1986, as amended), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the English company in such proceedings. _Preference_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the court for an order to set aside a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believed that such guarantee constituted a preference. It will only be a preference if at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction the English company is insolvent. The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the English company grants the guarantee. A transaction may constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court has very wide powers for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given, which could include reducing payments under the Notes and the guarantees (although there is protection for a third party who enters into one of the transactions in good faith and without notice). However, for the court to determine a preference, it must be shown that the English company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was insolvent and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence. _Transactions Defrauding Creditors_ Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was made for the purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim, which that 293 ----- person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a ‘‘victim’’ of the transaction and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators. There is no time limit in the English insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of the transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. The court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by an English company up to three years before the day on which the English company entered into administration or went into liquidation. A transaction is ‘‘extortionate’’ if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

However, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, where an English company conducts business in another member state of the European Union, the jurisdiction of the English courts may be limited if the company’s ‘‘center of main interests’’ is found to be in a Member State other than the United Kingdom (please see ‘‘—European Union’’). There are a number of factors that are taken into account to ascertain the ‘‘centre of main interests.’’ The ‘‘centre of main interests’’ should correspond to the place where the company conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties. The place of the registered office of the company is presumed to be the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ in the absence of proof to the contrary. The point at which this issue falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. Similarly, the UK Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency in the United Kingdom, provide that a foreign (i.e., non-European) court may have jurisdiction where any English company has a ‘‘centre of its main interests’’ in such foreign jurisdiction, or where it has an ‘‘establishment’’ (being a place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction, where it carries out non-transitory economic activities with human means and assets or services).",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

In those cases where the U.S. Obligors’ solvency is a relevant factor, the measures of insolvency will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, a party would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing indebtedness, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its indebtedness as it becomes due. We cannot be sure as to the standard that a court would use to determine whether or not a party was solvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that the court uses, that the incurrence of the obligations under the Notes and the issuance of the guarantees, whether now or in the future by the U.S. Obligors would not be voided or the Note Guarantee would not be subordinated to the Guarantors’ other debt. If such a case were to occur, the Note Guarantee could also be subject to the claim that, since the Guarantees were incurred for our benefit and only indirectly for the benefit of the Guarantors, the obligations of the applicable Guarantor were incurred for less than fair consideration.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

A chapter 11 plan provides for the comprehensive treatment of all claims asserted against the debtor and its property, and may provide for the readjustment or extinguishment of equity interests. Claims and interests may be classified by type. Only those classes of claims and interests impaired by the plan may vote to accept or reject such plan. Classes of 294 ----- claims and interests that are unimpaired are not entitled to vote on the plan, and are deemed to accept it.

213_2,Offerings 2018.md,867,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND ANY NOTE GUARANTEES,867.5,Canada,867.5.1,,"Refresco Canada Inc. is a corporation organized under the federal laws of Canada (the ‘‘Canadian Guarantor’’). Bankruptcy and insolvency matters are within the jurisdiction of the Federal government of Canada, but provincial laws can affect bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings. In the event of the insolvency of the Canadian Guarantor, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Canada in which case, Canadian insolvency laws and applicable provincial legislation would govern those proceedings (subject to laws or protocols that may be applicable to international insolvencies if proceedings also occur in other jurisdictions in respect of the Canadian Guarantor). The insolvency laws of Canada and related provincial legislation may restrict, delay or limit certain of your rights and remedies, including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-filing interest and other amounts and exercising rights and remedies for the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes or to require the performance by the Canadian Guarantor of its obligations or its guarantee. In Canada, there are two primary Federal statutes that govern insolvency and restructuring proceedings of corporate debtors. The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (the ‘‘BIA’’) contains provisions for the liquidation of insolvent companies (in a manner loosely akin, in substance, to U.S. Chapter 7 proceedings, although there are important distinctions) and for the restructuring of corporations (in a manner loosely akin, in substance, to U.S. Chapter 11 proceedings, although there are important distinctions). Similar to bankruptcy proceedings in the United States, a corporate debtor may be petitioned into bankruptcy (i.e., involuntary proceedings) or file for bankruptcy or reorganization (i.e., voluntary proceedings). In addition to the BIA, Canada also has the _Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (‘‘CCAA’’), which is a restructuring statute that operates, in practice, in a manner loosely akin to U.S. Chapter 11 proceedings (with important distinctions). CCAA proceedings are only available to insolvent debtor companies having debts in excess of CDN$5 million (or such other amount prescribed by regulation under the CCAA). Such proceedings in Canada under the BIA or the CCAA are court-supervised. The Canadian court has extensive experience in cross-border insolvencies, and in particular, with proceedings coordinated with United States courts. Part XIII of the BIA and Part IV of the CCAA provide mechanisms for the recognition of foreign insolvency proceedings as well as the coordination and conduct of concurrent insolvency proceedings. These provisions are based on the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency and principles of comity and cooperation. In the event that the Canadian Guarantor and one or more of the Group are insolvent, Canadian insolvency proceedings in respect of the Canadian Guarantor may be coordinated with or ancillary to insolvency proceedings supervised by courts of a foreign jurisdiction. Upon the bankruptcy of a debtor corporation, whether voluntary or upon the application of a creditor, the BIA imposes an automatic stay of any action, execution or other proceeding by unsecured creditors in respect of the debtor, unless the creditors first obtain leave of the applicable court. In a liquidation (as opposed to restructuring) of the debtor corporation, the stay of proceedings will not generally apply to secured creditors, who are free to exercise their rights of self-help or to otherwise realize on their security outside of the BIA. However, in exceptional cases, the court may, on application, stay the rights of a secured creditor for up to six months. Upon becoming bankrupt, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, all of a debtor’s assets (subject to very limited exceptions) vest in the trustee in bankruptcy (subject to the rights of secured creditors with validly perfected security interests), at which point the debtor no longer has any 295 ----- ability to deal with those assets. The trustee typically proceeds to liquidate the assets and distribute the proceeds of the assets in accordance with the provisions of the BIA. The BIA sets out the priority scheme for the payment of claims against a bankrupt debtor, which priority scheme takes precedence over any operative priority scheme outside of bankruptcy. Subject to certain statutory priority claims enumerated in the BIA (including, without limitation, ‘‘super priority’’ charges under the BIA against a debtor’s current assets (for example, employee wages of up to CDN$2,000 per employee), and against all a debtor’s assets for certain pension plan contributions) and trust claims that are true trusts or deemed trusts that continue in a bankruptcy, secured creditors have the right to look first to the assets charged by their validly perfected security for payment. Thereafter, the BIA provides a list of preferred creditors who recover their debts in priority to the general body of unsecured creditors. Preferred claims must be paid in full, in order of their ranking, before any payments to lower ranking preferred creditors or general unsecured creditors. All other claims will be considered general unsecured claims and rank pari passu (except for certain postponed claims such as equity claims and claims of certain non-arm’s length creditors). If there is any surplus after payment to the unsecured creditors and postponed creditor claims, the balance will be used to pay interest from the date of the bankruptcy at 5% per annum on all claims proved in the bankruptcy according to their priority. Any remaining amount would then be available for shareholders. The proceeds resulting from the realization of the estate of the insolvent Canadian Guarantor may not be sufficient to satisfy secured claims or your deficiency claims as unsecured creditors under the guarantee(s) granted by the Canadian Guarantor after the Canadian Guarantor’s prior-ranking secured creditors and other claims that rank in priority to claims of holders of Notes have been satisfied. In addition, it may take several years to fully complete insolvency proceedings, especially in the event of multi-jurisdictional proceedings, and to make a final distribution to all creditors. The manner in which unsecured creditors of the Canadian Guarantor would be treated in a restructuring proposal or plan would generally be proposed by the Canadian Guarantor, subject to (i) the rights of creditors affected by the proposal or plan to vote on such proposal or plan and (ii) approval by the court. Corporate restructurings in Canada may be implemented under either the BIA or the CCAA, with the latter being more commonly used by larger corporations. In either case, a broad stay of creditors’ rights and enforcement proceedings is generally implemented (in the case of the BIA by a statutory stay, and in the case of the CCAA by a court-ordered stay). A CCAA stay generally applies to secured creditors, subject to certain limited exceptions. Under this court-ordered protection, the debtor will typically formulate a restructuring proposal or plan or conduct an orderly wind-down or a sale as a going concern. In the event of a restructuring proposal or plan, a double majority of the creditors (i.e., a simple majority in number having two-thirds in value of the claims in question) present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting of creditors for each designated class must approve the proposal or plan, and the proposal or plan must be sanctioned by the court. Secured creditors may be included in such a proposal or plan (in which case they may have a right to vote in a separate class) or may be dealt with outside of the proposal or plan. In the event of a sale, proceeds are generally distributed in accordance with the priority established by statute and the court (which may differ in some respects from those in a bankruptcy under the BIA). The court may also authorize the creation of priority charges ranking ahead of other creditors in both CCAA and BIA restructurings (for example, for DIP financings, directors’ and officers’ indemnification and administration costs). A sale by a company under BIA restructuring or CCAA protection out of the ordinary course requires approval by the court with notice to the secured creditors likely to be affected by the proposed sale. The court may approve such sales absent a vote by the creditors in certain circumstances. Where a debtor deals with its property in a manner that prejudices its creditors (particularly where such debtor is or becomes insolvent thereafter), such transactions by the debtor may be subject to challenge by creditors or others and the scrutiny of the court. Under Canadian federal and provincial law, there are a number of statutory means to challenge or void certain reviewable transactions such as transfers that are fraudulent or a preference. Where a transaction subject to review is held to be contrary to Canadian law, the transaction is subject to being impugned and a variety of possible remedies may be imposed. Should the Canadian Guarantor become insolvent within applicable time periods, the granting of the guarantee could be subject to challenge and the guarantee potentially avoided. This includes that if the Canadian Guarantor becomes subject to Canadian bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceedings, payments made to the holders of Notes may be required to be returned or the guarantee may be avoided 296 ----- or set aside under Canadian federal or provincial legislation if it is judicially determined that, among other things: - at the time of the payment or of the making of the guarantee, the Canadian Guarantor was insolvent and the payment or guarantee was given with a view to giving a preference to, or conferred a fraudulent or unjust preference on, the recipient; - the payment or making of the guarantee was intended to defeat, hinder, delay or defraud creditors; - the payment or making of the guarantee was oppressive to creditors; or - the obligation of the guarantor was incurred for less than fair consideration. If the guarantee is avoided or set aside then, among other things, a claim against the Canadian Guarantor or its assets may not be tenable, amounts paid may need to be returned and the remaining assets of the Group may not be sufficient to pay amounts then due under the Notes. 297 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.

This discussion is based upon the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the ‘‘Treasury Regulations’’), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as of on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion does not address the impact of the U.S. federal Medicare tax on net investment income or the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the ‘‘IRS’’) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass-through entities (or investors in such entities), persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement, persons liable for alternative minimum tax and persons holding the Notes as part of a ‘‘straddle,’’ ‘‘hedge,’’ ‘‘conversion transaction’’ or other integrated transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for cash at original issue and at their ‘‘issue price’’ (the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code. For purposes of this discussion, a ‘‘U.S. holder’’ is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person. If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.

Interest generally will be 303 ----- income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize interest income equal to the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot rate on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A cash basis U.S. holder will not realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest income but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposal of the foreign currency received. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes, or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, such U.S. holder will recognize income for each taxable year equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency accrued for such year determined by translating such amount into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the U.S. holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual basis U.S. holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the electing U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period), or at the spot rate on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. holder of Notes that uses the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize foreign currency gain or loss, on the date such interest is received, equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment, determined at the spot rate on the date the payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income previously included in respect of such payment. This exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S.-source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such U.S. holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations.

In such event, U.S. holders generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. holders will generally include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. The Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount exceeds the issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined _de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). In the event that the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. holder is the sum of the ‘‘daily portions’’ of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds the Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any ‘‘accrual period’’ a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s ‘‘adjusted issue price’’ at the beginning of such accrual period and its ‘‘yield to maturity,’’ determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note. 304 ----- OID generally will be income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in foreign currency and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described above in the third paragraph under ‘‘—Payments of Stated Interest.’’ A U.S. holder will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment received, determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note other than stated interest will be viewed first, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and second, as receipts of principal. Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

The cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the exchange rate in effect on that date. If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of the Note at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase. Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized (other than amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as ordinary interest income in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of tax accounting as described above) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. The amount realized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note for an amount of foreign currency will generally be the U.S. dollar value of that amount based on the spot rate on the date of taxable disposition. If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and, if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described above, such election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates will be ordinary income or loss and, with respect to the principal thereof, will generally be equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined on the date the U.S. holder acquired the Note. The exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and, if any, accrued OID (which will be treated as discussed above under ‘‘—Payments of Stated Interest,’’ or ‘‘—Original Issue Discount,’’ as applicable) will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by the U.S. holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note, and will be treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will generally be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the Note for more than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition. In the case of an individual U.S. holder, any such gain may be eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates if the U.S. holder satisfies certain prescribed minimum holding periods.

Tax matters are complex, and the tax consequences of the Offering to a particular holder of Notes will depend in part on such holder’s circumstances. Accordingly, a holder is urged to consult his own tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the Offering to him, including the applicability and effect of Dutch tax laws. Where in this summary English terms and expressions are used to refer to Dutch concepts, the meaning to be attributed to such terms and expressions shall be the meaning to be attributed to the equivalent Dutch concepts under Dutch tax law. Where in this summary the terms ‘‘the Netherlands’’ and ‘‘Dutch’’ are used, these refer solely to the European part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. This summary assumes that the Issuer is organized, and that its business will be conducted, in the manner outlined in this offering memorandum. A change to such organizational structure or to the manner in which the Issuer conducts its business may invalidate the contents of this summary, which will not be updated to reflect any such change. This summary is based on the tax law of the Netherlands (unpublished case law not included) as it stands at the date of this offering memorandum. The tax law upon which this summary is based, is subject to changes, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change may invalidate the contents of this summary, which will not be updated to reflect such change. 306 ----- The summary in this Dutch taxation paragraph does not address the Dutch tax consequences for a holder of Notes who: (i) is a person who may be deemed an owner of Notes for Dutch tax purposes pursuant to specific statutory attribution rules in Dutch tax law; (ii) is, although in principle subject to Dutch corporation tax, in whole or in part, specifically exempt from that tax in connection with income from Notes; (iii) is an investment institution as defined in the Dutch Corporation Tax Act 1969; (iv) owns Notes in connection with a membership of a management board or a supervisory board, an employment relationship, a deemed employment relationship or management role; (v) has a substantial interest in the Issuer or a deemed substantial interest in the Issuer for Dutch tax purposes. Generally, a person holds a substantial interest if (a) such person—either alone or, in the case of an individual, together with his partner or any of his relatives by blood or by marriage in the direct line (including foster-children) or of those of his partner for Dutch tax purposes—owns or is deemed to own, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the shares or of any class of shares of the Issuer, or rights to acquire, directly or indirectly, such an interest in the shares of the Issuer or profit participating certificates relating to 5% or more of the annual profits or to 5% or more of the liquidation proceeds of the Issuer, or (b) such person’s shares, rights to acquire shares or profit participating certificates in the Issuer are held by him following the application of a non-recognition provision; or (vi) is a corporate entity or taxable as a corporate entity and who is resident or deemed to be resident of Aruba, Cura¸cao or Sint Maarten for tax purposes.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. Depending on market conditions, certain of the Initial Purchasers may decide to initially purchase and hold a portion of the Notes for their own accounts. After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. Sales of the Notes by the Initial Purchasers in the United States may be made through affiliates of the Initial Purchasers. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. The Issuer has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that is 30 days after the date of the Purchase Agreement, without the prior written consent as provided for in the Purchase Agreement. The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes described in this offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. The target market and distribution channel(s) may vary in relation to sales outside the EEA in light of local regulatory regimes in force in the relevant jurisdiction. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such Notes (by either adopting 313 ----- or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required.

These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time.

See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—There may not be an active _trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.’’_ These stabilizing transactions and covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Stabilizing Manager. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes.

None of the directors of the Issuer reside in the United States and a substantial amount of the Issuer’s assets, and a substantial amount of the assets of the Issuer and Dutch Guarantors’ directors are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process upon the Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor or such persons. Furthermore, the United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any court in any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a competent Dutch court and the judgment rendered by the foreign court must be submitted in the course of such proceedings, in which case the Dutch court will have to decide whether and to what extent it, given the circumstances of the case, will recognize the foreign judgment. A Dutch court will, under current practice, generally grant the same judgment without relitigation on the merits if (a) that judgment results from proceedings compatible with the Dutch concept of due process, (b) that judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands, (c) the jurisdiction of the foreign court has been based on an internationally acceptable ground and (d) the judgment by the foreign court is not incompatible with a judgment rendered between the same parties by a Dutch court, or with an earlier judgment rendered between the same parties by a non-Dutch court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based on the same cause, provided that the earlier judgment qualifies for recognition in the Netherlands, which, _inter alia, entails that the judgment is enforceable in accordance with the laws of its country of origin. According to the Dutch Supreme Court, this will, inter alia, be lacking when an appeal has been filed which suspends the enforceability of the foreign judgment, when the foreign judgment was annulled by an appellate court and when the foreign judgment specifies it can only be enforced during a certain period that has expired or not yet commenced. Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties, investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands, judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that such judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil 319 ----- liability in an original action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. The enforcement and recognition of judgments of U.S. courts in the Netherlands are subject to the Dutch rules of civil procedure.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

There is currently no treaty between the United States and England providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (although the United States and the United Kingdom are both parties to the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards). Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any Federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England by way of civil law action on the judgment debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales (‘‘English court’’). In such an action, an English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; - the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy; - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to relate to penal or revenue law; - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 or based on measures designated by The Secretary of State under Section 1 of the Act; - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural justice or in proceedings contrary to the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights or the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union; - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of an English court (or another court whose judgement is entitled to recognition in England) in respect of the same matter; - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date of the U.S. judgment; and - the U.S. judgment was not obtained contrary to an agreement for the settlement of disputes under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in a United States court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit). Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. Federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England. In addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws. If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. These methods generally permit the court discretion to prescribe the manner of enforcement. It may not be possible to obtain an English judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set off or counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Also note that, in any 320 ----- enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in the Canadian province of Ontario (the ‘‘Canadian Province’’) is based upon advice provided to us by U.S. and Canadian legal advisors. The Canadian Province currently does not have a treaty with the United States of America or any state thereof providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any Federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in the Canadian Province. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in the Canadian Province, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in the Canadian Province (a ‘‘Canadian Court’’) to recognize the U.S. court judgment so that it may be enforced in the Canadian Province. In such proceedings, a Canadian Court will not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court in (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim. Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Canadian Court is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to conflicts of laws principles of the Canadian Province; - the U.S. judgment is final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it; - the U.S. judgment is for a definite sum of money; - the U.S. judgment does not contravene public policy of the Canadian Province; - the U.S. judgment is not in respect of the enforcement of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine imposed by the laws of the United States, any State therein, or under other foreign law; - the judgment is not contrary to an order made by the Attorney General of Canada under the Foreign _Extraterritorial Measures Act (Canada), or the Competition Tribunal under the_ _Competition Act_ (Canada) in respect of certain judgments referred to in these statutes or the Governor in Council under the United Nations Act (Canada) or the Special Economic Measures Act (Canada); - the U.S. judgment was not obtained by fraud or in breach of principles of natural justice as understood under the laws of the Canadian Province; - a Canadian Court in the Canadian Province has not rendered a prior inconsistent decision in respect of the same matter; and - the recognition and enforcement proceedings were commenced in the Canadian Province within the applicable limitation period in the Canadian Province. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce a judgment in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. Federal or state courts in the Canadian Province. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in the Canadian Province. In addition, it is questionable whether a Canadian Court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in the Canadian Province, instead of the United States, if the U.S. proceedings and U.S. judgment were predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws. 321 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has: - Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee) - Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee - The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: - The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee - Rights arising from other contractual arrangements - The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity while any resultant gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognized at fair value. The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable ----- assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Transactions and balances in foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognized in profit or loss with the exception of monetary items that are designated as part of the hedge of the Group’s net investment of a foreign operation. These are recognized in OCI until the net investment is disposed of, at which time, the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those monetary items are also recorded in OCI. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item i.e. translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognized in OCI or profit or loss are also recognized in OCI or profit or loss, respectively. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into Euros at the exchange rate at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Euros at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions (or at an average rate if this is not an unreasonable approximation). Foreign currency differences arising thereon are recognized, in other comprehensive income, in the foreign currency translation reserve. When a foreign operation is disposed of, either in part or in full, the associated cumulative amount in the foreign currency translation reserve is transferred to profit or loss as an adjustment to the profit or loss on disposal. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of the net investment in the foreign operation and are recognized in other comprehensive income in the foreign currency translation reserve.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623
213_2,Offerings 2018.md,363,GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMS,363.37,2.3** **Financial instruments,363.37.1,,"Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables. Non-derivative financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described below. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, checks in transit and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the cash management processes are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement. The accounting for finance income and expense is described in note 2.17. Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group holds derivative financial instruments (interest rate swaps, commodity hedges, forward exchange contracts and currency options) to hedge its foreign currency, commodity and interest rate risk exposures. The Group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to minimize the effects of fluctuations of foreign currencies and interest rates in the profit or loss. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. The method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting. The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well ----- as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized in the income statement immediately. When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when it is recognized. In other cases the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred to the same line of profit or loss in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss. Where the financial instruments are held to hedge foreign currency purchases of raw materials and consumables, the changes are included in raw materials and consumables used. Where the instruments are held to hedge interest rate risk exposure, the changes are included in finance income and expense. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued. The cumulative unrealized gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity, is recognized in profit or loss immediately, or when a hedging instrument is terminated. If the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in other comprehensive income and is recognized in accordance with the above-mentioned policy when the transaction occurs. The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 3.3. Movements of the hedging reserve in other comprehensive income are shown in note 5.8. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. They are included in current assets, except for loans and receivables for which the expected settlement is greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. Borrowings Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortized cost; any difference between the proceeds(net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognized as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalized as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortized over the period of the facility to which it relates. Borrowing costs General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization. All other borrowing costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. Trade payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labor, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a condition suitable for their intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring of the site on which they are located. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of a qualifying asset are allocated to the assets when incurred. When elements of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the net proceeds of disposal with the carrying amount and are recognized on a net basis in other income in profit or loss. Subsequent costs The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the item. If it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably, the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. The costs of the day-to-day maintenance of property, plant and equipment are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.

The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows: - Buildings : 25 years - Machinery and equipment : 5-10 years - Other fixed assets : 3-10 years Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.

213_2,Offerings 2018.md,363,GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMS,363.41,2.7** **Intangible assets,363.41.1,,"Goodwill Goodwill is initially measured at cost (being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests and any previous interest held over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed). If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in profit or loss. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit (CGU) and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained. The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset, except for properties previously revalued with the revaluation taken to OCI. For such properties, the impairment is recognised in OCI up to the amount of any previous revaluation. Other intangibles Software acquired by the Group is measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only to the extent that it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally ----- generated goodwill and brands, is recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Amortization is recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, generally 3 years. Brands acquired, separately or as part of a business combination, are capitalized if they meet the definition of an intangible asset and the recognition criteria are satisfied. Brands acquired as part of a business combination are valued at fair value based on the relief from royalty method. Brands are amortized on an individual basis over the estimated useful life of the brand. Customer and sales channel-related and contract-based intangibles are capitalized if they meet the definition of an intangible asset and the recognition criteria are satisfied. The relationship between brands and customer and sales channel-related intangibles is carefully considered so that brands and customer and sales channel-related intangibles are not both recognized on the basis of the same cash flows. Customer and sales channel-related and contract-based intangibles acquired as part of a business combination are valued at fair value and amortized over the period of the contractual arrangements or the remaining useful life of the customer relationships.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of the asset that can be reliably estimated. Impairment losses in respect of financial assets measured at amortized cost are calculated as the difference between the carrying amounts and present values of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. An impairment loss in respect of an available-for-sale financial asset is measured by reference to its fair value. Individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized. For financial assets measured at amortized cost and for debt instruments measured in the available for sale category the reversal is recognized in profit or loss. Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated annually. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time, value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the ‘cash-generating units’). ----- For the purpose of impairment testing, the goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognized in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (or group of units) on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available. Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan. Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognized in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates on government bonds are used. For pension plans whereby a limit on the employer’s future contribution to the pension plans exist, the Group will reflect this limit in its calculations. For these plans the Group will apply a liability cap in case the present value of the future service cost exceeds the present value of the future maximum employer contributions and the defined benefit obligation exceeds the asset value. The liability cap does not exceed the difference between the defined benefit obligation and the asset value. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. ----- Past-service costs are recognized immediately in income. Multi-employer plans The Group also facilitates multi-employer plans, in which various employers contribute to one central pension union. In accordance with IAS 19R, as the pension union managing the plan is not able to provide the Group with sufficient information to enable the Group to account for the plan as a defined benefit plan, the Group accounts for its multi-employer defined benefit plan as if it were a defined contribution plan. Other long term employee benefits The net obligation in respect of long term employee benefits other than pension plans is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any related assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the obligations of the Group. The calculation is performed using the projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. Termination benefits Termination benefits are employee benefits provided in exchange for the termination of an employee’s employment as a result of either an entity’s decision to terminate an employee’s employment before the normal retirement date; or an employee’s decision to accept an offer of benefits in exchange for the termination of employment. A liability is recognized at the earlier of the following dates: when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and when the entity recognizes costs for a restructuring and involves the payment of termination benefits. Short term benefits Short term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be reliably estimated.

In the context of IFRS 15, the Group will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Group has ----- reviewed customer contracts, identified the separate performance obligations, determined the transaction price, allocated the transaction price and determined when a performance obligation has been satisfied. Contracts are reviewed for presence of variable considerations such as discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives, performance bonuses, penalties and/or any other compensations received from clients. The Group will apply the modified retrospective approach and expects some small adjustments in capital expense contributions and storage contributions, but did not yet finalize the assessment of the quantitative impact on the financial statements. However, based on the analysis performed so far, the Group expects no significant impact. The Group leases office buildings, warehouses, machinery and equipment and cars. For the year 2017 the Group recognizes an expense in the income statement of EUR 40.0 million and reports a contingent liability relating to these assets of EUR 156.7 as per December 31, 2017 (see note 6.2). Under IFRS 16, most of these contracts classify as leases because the Group has the right to control the assets. Under IFRS 16 the asset value of these assets will be recorded as Property, plant and equipment and the corresponding lease liability will be recorded as a liability. The lease expenses will be transferred from the Other operating expenses to Depreciation, Amortization and impairments and Finance expenses. The Group will apply the modified retrospective transition method and is reviewing the lease contracts and identifying proper measurements. At this moment the Group can not report properly and reliably the quantitative impact of the new standard. In the context of IFRS 9, the Group will recognise a financial asset or a financial liability when it becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset or a financial liability at its fair value plus or minus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or the financial liability. IFRS 9 divides all financial assets that are currently in the scope of IAS 39 into two classifications - those measured at amortised cost and those measured at fair value. Where assets are measured at fair value, gains and losses are either recognised entirely in profit or loss, or recognised in other comprehensive income. The Group will adopt the new standard on the required effective date and will not restate comparative information. During 2017, the Group has performed a high level impact assessment of all three aspects of IFRS 9. This assessment is based on currently available information and may be subject to changes arising from further reasonable and supportable information being made available to the Group in 2018 when the Group will adopt IFRS 9. The Group expects a possible limited impact on the allowance for doubtful debts resulting in a possible negative impact on equity. In addition, the Group will continue to apply IAS 39 for hedging accounting and implement changes in classification of certain financial instruments.

The operating results are regularly reviewed by the Executive Board, being the Chief Operating Decision Maker, for decisions about resource allocation and to assess segment performance. Europe is centrally organized to maximize operational efficiencies, synergies and funding through its headquarters in Rotterdam. The central activities include decisions related to allocating resources, (central) sales, operations and footprint, financing of the Group, procurement, major investments and acquisitions, human resources, treasury, reporting and ICT. In order to use its European footprint for reduction of production and transportation costs, and to be close to local clients, the segment Europe has seven regionally- focused business units, which focus on (local) sales and production. North America is centrally organized, with the headquarter in Wharton, New Jersey and three regionally-focused business units, which focus on (local) sales and production. In 2017 we separated the corporate activities from the European segment in anticipation of the Group's future growth. Because the corporate activities do not generate (external) revenues, the Group has not defined these activities as a separate segment (see note 4.1). The segments’ performance is evaluated against several measures, of which operating income is the most important. Intersegment sales are executed under normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to unrelated third parties. Net sales are attributed to geographic regions based on the location of stores. The segment reporting is disclosed in note 4.1 and the entity-wide disclosures have been included in note 4.1, 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2. ----- 3 financial risk management The Company is centrally organized to maximize operational efficiencies, synergies, and funding through its headquarters in Rotterdam. The central activities include decisions related to allocating resources, (central) sales, operations and footprint, financing of the Group, procurement, major investments and acquisitions, human resources, treasury, reporting and ICT. In order to use its European footprint for reduction of production and transportation costs, and to be close to local clients, the Company has seven regionally-focused business units, which focus on (local) sales and production. The Executive Board, being the Chief Operating Decision Maker, does not review the operating results of specific components of the Group to make decisions about resources to be allocated to such component and assess its performance, due to the high level of centralization and integration. Therefore, Refresco management concluded there is only one operating segment, as defined in IFRS 8.

The Supervisory Board oversees management’s monitoring of compliance with the risk management policies and procedures of the Group and it reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. 3.1.1 Credit risk Credit risk represents the risk that counter parties fail to meet their contractual obligations. It arises principally in the receivables from customers, cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions. The Group does not have any significant concentration of credit risk. In order to reduce the exposure to credit risk, the Group carries out ongoing credit evaluations of the financial position of customers, but generally does not require collateral. Use is made of a combination of independent ratings and risk controls to assess the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors. Sales are subject to payment conditions which are common practice in each country. The banks and financial institutions used as counterparty for holding cash and cash equivalents and deposits and in derivative transactions can be classified as high credit quality financial institutions (minimal A rating Standard & Poor’s). The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to individual financial institutions. Management believes that the likelihood of losses arising from credit risk is remote, particularly in the light of the diversification of activities.

At any point in time the Group hedges 80 to 100% of its foreign currency exposure on contracted forecasted purchases. The Group uses currency option contracts and forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risks, most of which have a maturity date of less than one year from the reporting date. When necessary, foreign currency contracts are rolled over on maturity. In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates, as necessary, to address short term imbalances. In order to minimize the impact of accounting mismatches in the profit or loss account, the Group applies cash flow hedge accounting. The effectiveness of the hedge relationship is measured based on changes in intrinsic value of options and fair value of forward contracts. The changes in time value of the currency options are directly recorded in the income statement, as part of raw material costs. Per year-end the cash flow hedge accounting relationships were fully effective. There are no forecasted transactions for which hedge accounting has been applied, but which are no longer expected to occur. The fair value of foreign currency instruments per reporting date is EUR 2.6 million credit (2016: EUR 9.7 million debit). The Group records a hedge reserve of EUR 0.5 million loss net of deferred taxes in equity (2016: EUR 5.0 million profit) relating to the effective part of the intrinsic value changes of the foreign currency option contracts and the fair value of the forward contracts. During 2017 and 2016 no amounts were recorded in raw material costs due to ineffectiveness. Additionally, the Group entered into deal contingent hedges of a total amount of USD 750.0 million to hedge the cash out flow for the acquisition of Cott. As per the reporting date, management’s best estimation of the timing of the transaction was January 29, 2018. Under this condition the contracts are valued per reporting date at a fair value of EUR 2.8 million debit. The deal contingent hedges settled on January 29, in line with management’s estimate.

On fixed interest receivables and liabilities, it is exposed to market value fluctuations. For certain variable interest rate long term liabilities, the Group has entered into interest rate swap agreements through which the Group effectively pays fixed interest rates on these liabilities. The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting to offset the profit or loss impact resulting from timing differences between variable interest rate liabilities and the interest rate swap. Throughout the year 2016 and 2017 as well as per year-end the cash flow hedge accounting relationships were effective. The fair value of interest rate swaps per reporting date is EUR 7.0 million credit (2016: EUR 11.9 million credit).

Sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and the Group does not designate derivatives (interest rate swaps) as hedging instruments under a fair value hedge accounting model.

To manage these risks procurement operates within the framework of centrally specified policies and guidelines and must act in conformance with the required internal control measures. The Group contract positions are based on a thorough understanding of the raw material markets and in principle contracted sales are covered back-to-back. The Group centralizes the procurement of raw materials, packaging materials and indirect spend for Europe and the US. Authority levels of local management have been shifted towards the Group central procurement organization which is executing and monitoring the main contracts and important purchase decisions. Commodities are only purchased locally after approval of the central purchasing department. Contracts exceeding predefined limits must be authorized by the Executive Board. Existing contract positions are closely monitored and, when necessary, corrective actions are evaluated and implemented. To enable the Group to stay ahead of the current situation in the raw materials markets and maintain its gross margins, it implements pass-on clauses into sales contracts with customers. In parallel, the quality of management information has been enhanced by the development of a network enabling knowledge of markets, suppliers and conditions of raw materials to be shared at Group level. The Group hedges the raw material aluminum through derivatives. The fair value of this raw material derivative is recognized in profit and loss. The fair value per year-end is EUR 1.0 million debit (2016: EUR 0.8 million debit). Pension risk The Group contributes to a number of defined benefit plans that provide pension benefits to employees upon retirement in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Belgium and the UK. The amount of the benefits depends on age, salary and years of service. Furthermore, the Group has an indemnity plan in France and obligations for jubilee in the Netherlands, Germany and France.

Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the methods set out below. Where applicable further information regarding the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability. Property, plant and equipment The fair value of property, plant and equipment recognized as a result of a business combination is based on market values. The market value of property is the estimated amount for which a property would likely be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion. The market value of items of machinery and equipment and other fixed assets is based on the quoted market prices for similar items. Other intangible assets The fair value of brands and sales channels acquired in a business combination is determined based on the relief of royalty method. The fair value of other intangible assets is based on the discounted cash flows expected to be derived from the use and eventual sale of these assets. Inventories The fair value of inventories acquired in a business combination is determined based on the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale and less a reasonable profit margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories. Trade and other receivables The fair value of trade and other receivables equal the carrying amount due to the short term nature. Levels of financial instruments The Group defines the following different levels of fair value: - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2) - Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (Level 3) Non-derivative financial liabilities Fair value for disclosure purposes is based on their listed market price, if available. If a listed market price is not available, the fair value is estimated by calculating the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For finance leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements. Fair values The carrying amounts of other financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair value as they have variable interest rates and the impact of discounting is therefore not significant. ----- The following table presents the Group’s financial assets and liabilities, measured at fair value on December 31, 2017.

Estimates and underlying ----- assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any subsequent periods affected. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Judgments In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgments, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements: Held for sale In 2017 none of the properties of the Group were available for sale. Management considered that the criteria to be classified as held for sale were not met as per December 31, 2017. Segmentation Refresco’s management defines the operating segments Europe and the US in the context of IFRS 8. Because of the high level of centralization and integration within Europe, the Group considers Europe as one segment. The core functions for Europe are performed at the headquarters in Rotterdam and the Group applies the Pan European approach to its Europe operations. The core functions for the US are performed separately from the Europe operations. Contract manufacturing Contract manufacturing consists of the provision of manufacturing services and sale of the resultant product. The nature and the risk profile of the contract with the customer are key in determining whether the Group is providing a manufacturing service or is selling a product. The revenue is recognized solely for the activities, ingredients and materials for which the Group is the principal and has the risk and rewards. Estimates The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below. Estimated goodwill The group estimates the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired by acquisitions. This measurement is provisional and can be adjusted within 12 months after the date of each acquisition. The acquisitions are recorded in note 6.1. Estimated impairment of goodwill The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2.10. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations and are recorded in note 5.2. These calculations require the use of estimates. Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes. The Group recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made. Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. The Group uses its judgment to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at the end of each reporting period. Additional information is disclosed in note 2.3. Pension benefits The present value of the pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost (income) for pensions include the discount rate. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of pension obligations. The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each ----- year. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligation. Other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions. Additional information is disclosed in note 5.10. Information for other areas of estimation and critical judgment used in applying accounting policies can be found in the following notes: - Note 2.8: Leased assets - Note 3: Financial risk management - Note 5.1: Property plant and equipment - Note 5.2: Intangible assets - Note 5.11: Other provisions 4 notes to the consolidated income statement The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the European Union requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, especially the periodical review of useful lives and residual values of property plant and equipment.

The effective tax rate is mainly impacted by the derecognition of previously recognized deferred tax assets. The de-recognition of deferred tax assets is because of the envisaged change of control related to the delisting by PAI in 2018 (see note 5.4). Non-deductible transaction costs in the US and France, non-deductible interest expenses in France and Germany and non-deductible operational costs in all jurisdictions have a negative impact on the effective tax rate. In addition, other taxes charged in France and Italy and non-taxable participation related results increased the effective tax rate. On the positive side, the effective tax rate is impacted by the rate changes in the US and Germany and notional interest deduction in Belgium and Italy. The main part beeing EUR 4.3 million relates to North America resulting from revaluation of the deferred tax poitions agains the lower enacted tax rate of 21%. Furthermore, investment allowances in several jurisdictions and the decrease in uncertain tax provisions have lowered the effective tax rate.

Reference is made to note 6.1. The decrease of the goodwill of Poland relates to an impairment of EUR 3.1 million offset by an increase relating to the foreign currency effect. The decrease of the goodwill of North America relates to the foreign currency effect. The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are based on value-in-use calculations. Value in-use was determined by discounting the future pre-tax cash flows generated from the continuing use of the unit using a pre-tax discount rate and was based on the following key assumptions: - Cash flows were projected based on the current operating results and the 3-year business plan covering the period 2018-2020, which is approved by the Executive and Supervisory Board. Future cash flows beyond this period were extrapolated using a growth rate which is based on the growth expectations of the local market. These growth expectations are retrieved from research by independent external sources. The growth rates are in a range of 1.0% to 2.0% and are considered appropriate taking into account the expected retailer brands market development. The company takes into account production efficiency improvements, waste reduction and the cost reduction programs which are anticipated to contribute positively to the future cash flows. Management believes that the 3-year business plan period is appropriate to the long term nature of the business. - A pre-tax discount rate is based on credit risk per country, a weighted average cost of capital applicable to the industry and the applicable tax rate per cash generating unit.

The recoverable amounts of the units were determined to be higher than their carrying values for all cash generating units except for Poland. Based on value-in-use calculations of the recoverable amounts of the cash-generating unit Poland, an impairment loss of EUR 3.1 million for Poland is recognised in the income statement as depreciation, amortization and impairments and is related to the segment Europe. The impairment is recorded in the intangible assets and is fully related to goodwill.

When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognized within the statement of financial position. The Group expects that contributions to the defined benefit plans will be EUR 1.8 million in 2017 (2016:EUR 1.7 million). The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 18.6 years. Expected maturity analysis of undiscounted pension and other defined benefits: Year 3 up to and (x 1 million euro) Less than one year Year 2 including year 5 Year 6 up to and Total including year 10 Pensions & other 3.2 3.0 10.0 20.6 36.8 Through its defined benefit pension plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: - Asset volatility: The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if plan assets under perform this yield, this will create a deficit. The plan in the UK holds investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while these assets are expected to provide real returns over the long term, the short term volatility can cause additional funding to be required if deficits emerge. - Changes in bond yields: The plan’s liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the liabilities. As the plan holds assets such as equities the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way. A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans’ bond holdings. ----- - Inflation risk: Some of the Group pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation or inflation increases are only possible after excessive returns on assets). - Life expectancy: The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities. - The Group operates unfunded pension and jubilee plans, where the company meets the benefit payment obligation as it falls due. Future payments depend on salary developments, changes in life expectancy and turnover rates which might result in fluctuations in cash flows. Multi-employer plan About 350 company employees in the Netherlands participate in an industry-wide multi-employer plan, ‘Stichting Bedrijfstakpensioenfonds voor de Drankindustrie’ (the pension fund).The pension plan classifies as a multi-employer plan under IAS 19. This multi-employer plan covers approximately 300 companies and 4,000 contributing members. The pension fund monitors its risks on an overall basis, not by company or employee, and is subject to regulation by Dutch governmental authorities. By law (the Dutch Pension Act), a multi-employer plan must be monitored against specific criteria, including the policy funding ratio of the plan assets to its obligations. Since January 2015, a pension fund is obliged to report the policy funding ratio, which is the average funding ratio over the last 12 months. This policy funding ratio must exceed 104.2% for the total plan. Every company participating in the multi employer plan contributes a premium calculated as a percentage of its total pensionable salaries, with each company subject to the same percentage contribution rate. The premium can fluctuate and is set by the pension fund board in accordance with (minimum) premium requirements (kostendekkende premie) as required by regulation. In the case of a shortfall (or surplus) the Company has no obligation to pay (or receive) any supplementary contributions other than possibly higher (lower) future premiums. The pension rights of each employee are based upon the employee’s average salary during employment. As reported in January 2018, the policy funding ratio of the multi-employer plan increased to 114.3% as of December 31, 2016 108.4%. The policy funding ratio is calculated by dividing the plan assets by the total sum of pension liabilities and is based on actual market interest (including a so called new Ultimate Forward Rate as required by the Dutch Central Bank). The pension premium percentage is approximately 27.0% (17.2% employer, 9.8% employee) for 2017 (2016: 26.9%, 17.1% employer, 9.8% employee) . The multi-employer scheme is a defined benefit scheme but the Company accounts for the multi-employer plan as if it were a defined contribution plan, as the pension fund is not able to provide the Company with the required Company-specific information to allow the assets and liabilities to be separately identified. The Company’s pension expense for the multi-employer plan for a fiscal period is equal to the required contribution for that period.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

213_2,Offerings 2018.md,363,GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMS,363.212,Our key audit matters,363.212.1,,"Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the supervisory board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Risk Our audit approach Key observations The measurement of revenue: Refer to note 3.5 (Use of estimates and judgments) and note 2.14 (Significant accounting policies - Revenue) and note 4.2 (Revenue). Refresco Group N.V. has individual contracts with clients which are unique for its co-packing and private label businesses. The uniqueness is borne by e.g. different delivery terms and rebates. We identified revenue recognition as a fraud risk, requiring special audit attention. Valuation of goodwill: Refer to note 3.5 (Use of estimates and judgments) and note 5.2 (Intangible assets) Refresco Group N.V. has a significant amount of goodwill on its balance sheet amounting to € 523.4 million. In accordance with EU-IFRS, Refresco Group N.V. is required to perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis. The goodwill is allocated to nine Cash Generating Units (CGUs). The annual goodwill test was performed in October 2017 and updated to 31 December 2017, consistent with prior year. Refresco Group N.V. concluded that there is an impairment of € 3.1 million with respect to Poland, no other impairments were identified. These impairment tests are significant to our audit because the assessment process is complex and requires management judgment, and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market conditions. In our audit we have applied a mix of control-based audit procedures and substantive audit procedures on the revenue and revenue related accounts such as cost of goods sold, inventory and rebate accruals. These procedures, among others, consist of a detailed assessment of sales contracts, credit notes, detailed analytical reviews, cut off testing in order to verify that sales have been recorded in the correct year, attendance of inventory counts in order to verify the existence and valuation of inventory and detailed testing of revenue related rebate accruals. We also tested manual journal entries around year-end to ensure that revenue journals were approved and supported with underlying documentation. As part of our audit procedures we focused on the assumptions and methodologies used by the company, and also on the robustness of the planning process to evaluate whether the company is able to prepare reliable estimates. Given the complexity around this topic, we have used an EY valuation specialist to assist us in evaluating the assumptions and methodologies. The company uses assumptions with respect to Weighted Average Cost of Capital, future market and economic conditions such as expected inflation rates, economic growth rates, volumes, gross margin and expenses. In order to assess the reasonability of input data, the valuation model and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital we have, among others, compared the data with external data such as expected inflation rates, external market growth expectations and by analyzing sensitivities in the company’s valuation model. With regard to the sensitivities we specifically focused on the available headroom present in the CGUs and whether a reasonable possible change in assumptions (assumed to be 1%), such as the discount rate and the growth rate could cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount. We also focused on the adequacy of the company’s disclosures regarding assumptions. As the goodwill test was performed in October 2017 and updated to 31 December 2017, we have re assessed management’s analyses per 31 December 2017. We did not identify evidence of material misstatement in the revenue recognized in the year. We consider management’s key assumptions and estimates to be within the acceptable range and we assessed the disclosure (Note 5.2) in the financial statements being appropriate. We concur with management on the impairment recorded. In previous year ‘Accounting treatment acquisitions’ was identified as key audit matter. Since no significant acquisitions occurred in 2017, this topic is no longer a key audit matter. ----- Report on other information included in the annual report In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, the annual report contains other information that consists of: - The executive board report - The supervisory board report - Other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code - Additional information Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information: - Is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements - Contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code We have read the other information.

(‘Refresco Group’ or the ‘Company’ or, together with its group companies, the ‘Group’) is domiciled in the Netherlands, with its registered office at Fascinatio Boulevard 270, 3065 WB Rotterdam, trade register number 24395416 whose shares are publicly traded. The companies in note 3.1 of the company only financial statements have all been included in the consolidated financial statements. The activities of the Group consist of the manufacturing of fruit juices and soft drinks for retailers and A-brands. Sales and production are made both domestically and abroad, the European Union being the most important market followed by the United States. 1.2 **Basis of preparation Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention except for derivative financial instruments which are measured at fair value. The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Supervisory Board on March 8, 2017 and will be adopted by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 9, 2019. The Company financial statements are part of the 2016 financial statements of Refresco Group N.V. Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Euros, which is the Group’s presentation currency. All financial information presented in Euros has been rounded to the nearest million with one decimal, unless stated otherwise. 2 significant accounting policies The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, and have been applied consistently by the Group. 2.1 **Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at December 31, 2016. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has: - Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee) - Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee - The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: - The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee - Rights arising from other contractual arrangements - The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity while any resultant gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognized at fair value. The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. ----- Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. 2.2 **Foreign currency Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’), which equals the presentation currency, which is the Euro, except for UK (GBP), US (USD) and Poland (PLN). Transactions and balances in foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognized in profit or loss with the exception of monetary items that are designated as part of the hedge of the Group’s net investment of a foreign operation. These are recognized in OCI until the net investment is disposed of, at which time, the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those monetary items are also recorded in OCI. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognized in OCI or profit or loss are also recognized in OCI or profit or loss, respectively). Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into Euros at the exchange rate at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Euros at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions (or at an average rate if this is not an unreasonable approximation). Foreign currency differences arising thereon are recognized, in other comprehensive income, in the foreign currency translation reserve. When a foreign operation is disposed of, either in part or in full, the associated cumulative amount in the foreign currency translation reserve is transferred to profit or loss as an adjustment to the profit or loss on disposal. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of the net investment in the foreign operation and are recognized in other comprehensive income in the foreign currency translation reserve. 2.3 **Financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables. Non-derivative financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described below. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, checks in transit and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the cash management processes are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement. The accounting for finance income and expense is described in note 2.17. Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group holds derivative financial instruments (interest rate swaps, commodity hedges, forward exchange contracts and currency options) to hedge its foreign currency, commodity and interest rate risk exposures. The Group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to minimize the effects of fluctuations of foreign currencies and interest rates in the profit or loss. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. The method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting. The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. ----- The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized in the income statement immediately. When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when it is recognized. In other cases the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred to the same line of profit or loss in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss. Where the financial instruments are held to hedge foreign currency purchases of raw materials and consumables, the changes are included in raw materials and consumables used. Where the instruments are held to hedge interest rate risk exposure, the changes are included in finance income and expense. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued and the cumulative unrealized gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity, is recognized in profit or loss immediately, or when a hedging instrument is terminated, but the hedged transaction still is expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in other comprehensive income and is recognized in accordance with the above-mentioned policy when the transaction occurs. The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 3.3. Movements of the hedging reserve in other comprehensive income are shown in note 5.9. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. They are included in current assets, except for loans and receivables for which the expected settlement is greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. Borrowings Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortized cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognized as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalized as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortized over the period of the facility to which it relates. Borrowing costs General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization. All other borrowing costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. Trade payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. 2.4 **Share capital Ordinary share capital Ordinary share capital is classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognized as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects. Preference share capital Preference share capital is classified as equity if it is non-redeemable, or redeemable only at the Company’s option, and any dividends are discretionary for the Company. Dividends thereon are recognized as distributions within equity upon approval by the General Meeting of Shareholders. 2.5 **Non-controlling interest The Group recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognized amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Subsequently profits are allocated to non-controlling interest based on their net effective interest in the subsidiary. ----- 2.6 **Property, plant and equipment Recognition and measurement Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labor, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a condition suitable for their intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring of the site on which they are located. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of a qualifying asset are allocated to the assets when incurred. When elements of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the net proceeds of disposal with the carrying amount and are recognized on a net basis in other income in profit or loss. Subsequent costs The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably, the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. The costs of the day-to-day maintenance of property, plant and equipment are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Depreciation Depreciation is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each element of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows: - Buildings : 25 years - Machinery and equipment : 5-10 years - Other fixed assets : 3-10 years Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. 2.7 **Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the Group’s interest in net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognized immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed. Other intangibles Software acquired by the Group is measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only to the extent that it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Amortization is recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, generally 3 years. Brands acquired, separately or as part of a business combination, are capitalized if they meet the definition of an intangible asset and the recognition criteria are satisfied. Brands acquired as part of a business combination are valued at fair value based on the relief from royalty method. Brands are amortized on an individual basis over the estimated useful life of the brand. Customer and sales channel-related and contract-based intangibles are capitalized if they meet the definition of an intangible asset and the recognition criteria are satisfied. The relationship between brands and customer and sales channel-related intangibles is carefully considered so that brands and customer and sales channel-related intangibles are not both recognized on the basis of the same cash flows. Customer and sales channel-related and contract-based intangibles acquired as part of a business combination are valued at fair value and amortized over the period of the contractual arrangements or the remaining useful life of the customer relationships. 2.8 **Leased assets Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. The Group leases certain property, plant and equipment. Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. The main estimates and assumptions relate to residual values, applicable interest rates, and economic lifetime of the assets and ----- determination of the minimum lease payments. Finance leases are capitalized at the lease’s commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other long term payables. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term. Other leases are operating leases and are not recognized on the balance sheet and disclosed in note 6.2. 2.9 **Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out method, and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production and conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. The cost of finished goods and work in progress includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. 2.10 **Impairment Financial assets Financial assets are assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of the asset that can be reliably estimated. Impairment losses in respect of financial assets measured at amortized cost are calculated as the difference between the carrying amounts and present values of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. An impairment loss in respect of an available-for-sale financial asset is measured by reference to its fair value. Individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized. For financial assets measured at amortized cost and for debt instruments measured in the available for sale category the reversal is recognized in profit or loss. Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated annually. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the ‘cash-generating units’). For the purpose of impairment testing, the goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognized in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (or group of units) on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. 2.11 **Assets classified as held for sale and discontinued operations The Group classifies non-current assets (or disposal groups) as held for sale when the carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is highly probable. Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets are re-measured in accordance with the accounting policies of the Group. Thereafter the assets are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on re-measurement are recognized in profit or loss. Gains are not recognized in excess of any cumulative impairment loss. ----- Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortized once classified as held for sale. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately in the statement of financial position. A disposal group qualifies as discontinued operation if it is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and: - Represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations - Is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or - Is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale Discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as a single amount as profit or loss after tax from discontinued operations in the statement of profit or loss. 2.12 **Employee benefits The Group operates various post-employment schemes, including both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available. Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan. Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognized in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates on government bonds are used. For pension plans whereby a limit on the employer’s future contribution to the pension plans exist, the Group will reflect this limit in its calculations. For these plans the Group will apply a liability cap in case the present value of the future service cost exceeds the present value of the future maximum employer contributions and the defined benefit obligation exceeds the asset value. The liability cap does not exceed the difference between the defined benefit obligation and the asset value. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past-service costs are recognized immediately in income. Multi-employer plans The Group also facilitates multi-employer plans, in which various employers contribute to one central pension union. In accordance with IAS 19R, as the pension union managing the plan is not able to provide the Group with sufficient information to enable the Group to account for the plan as a defined benefit plan, the Group accounts for its multi-employer defined benefit plan as if it were a defined contribution plan. Other long term employee benefits The net obligation in respect of long term employee benefits other than pension plans is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any related assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the obligations of the Group. The calculation is performed using the projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. Termination benefits Termination benefits are employee benefits provided in exchange for the termination of an employee’s employment as a result of either an entity’s decision to terminate an employee’s employments before the normal retirement date; or an employee’s decision to accept an offer of benefits in exchange for the termination of employment. A liability is recognized at the earlier of the following dates: when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and when the entity recognizes costs for a restructuring and involves the payment of termination benefits. ----- Short term benefits Short term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be reliably estimated. 2.13 **Provisions A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a legal or constructive obligation that can be reliably estimated and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Restructuring A provision for restructuring is recognized when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or been publicly announced. Future operating costs are not provided for. 2.14 **Revenue Products sold Revenue from the sale of products is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates. Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Contract manufacturing Contract manufacturing consists of the provision of manufacturing services and sale of the resultant product. The nature and the risk profile of the contract with the customer are key in determining whether the Group is providing a manufacturing service or is selling a product. The revenue is recognized solely for the activities, ingredients and materials for which the Group is the principal and has the risk and rewards. 2.15 **Government grants Government grants are recognized at their fair value when it is reasonably assured that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received. Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are deducted from the carrying amount of the asset. Government grants relating to period costs are deferred and recognized in the income statement over the period necessary to match them with the costs they are intended to compensate. 2.16 **Lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognized, as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease. Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period of the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Contingent lease payments are expensed as occurred. 2.17 **Finance income and expense Finance income comprises interest income on bank deposits and fair value gains on interest hedging instruments that are recognized in profit or loss. Interest income is recognized in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Finance expense comprises interest expense on borrowings including derivative financial instruments, the unwinding of discount on provisions and fair value losses on interest hedging instruments that are recognized in profit or loss. 2.18 **Income tax Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognized in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in equity or other comprehensive income in which case the income tax expense is also recognized in equity or other comprehensive income. Current tax is the income tax expected to be payable on the taxable profit for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, together with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is recognized using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except: - When the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss - In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences in the reporting period they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. ----- Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset: - if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and - if they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or the tax assets and liabilities of which will be realized simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized. 2.19 **New standards and interpretations The following new standards and amendments became effective as of 1 January 2016: - Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 – Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortization, effective 1 January 2016 - Amendments to IFRS 11 - Accounting for Acquisition of Interests in Joint Operations, effective 1 January 2016 - Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41- Agriculture: Bearer Plants, effective 1 January 2016 - Amendments to IAS 27- Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements, effective 1 January 2016 - Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle, effective 1 January 2016 - Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 - Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception, effective 1 January 2016 - Amendments to IAS 1 – Disclosure Initiative, effective 1 January 2016 - Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits – Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions, effective 1 February 2015 - Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle (issued December 2013), effective 1 February 2015 These standards and amendments do not have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements. The following standards are issued but not yet effective as of 31 December 2016: - IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (issued in 2014), effective 1 January 2018 - IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective 1 January 2018 - IFRS 16 Leases, effective 1 January 2019 - Amendments to IAS 12 - Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealized Losses, effective 1 January 2017 - Amendments to IAS 7 - Disclosure Initiative, effective 1 January 2017 - IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, including amendments to IFRS 15: Effective date of IFRS 15 and Clarifications to IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective 1 January 2018 - Amendments to IFRS 2 - Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions, effective 1 January 2018 - Amendments to IAS 40 Investment Property – Transfers of Investment Property3, effective 1 January 2018 - IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration3, effective 1 January 2018 - Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle (issued December 2016), effective 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018 The Group is reviewing the impact of these standards and amendments on the Group’s consolidated financial statements. For IFRS 15 the Group will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Group uses the five-step model framework and expect no difficulties in identifying contracts with customers, identifying performance obligations, determining the transaction prices, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations and revenue recognition when the Group satisfies the performance obligations. The Group expects for the main part of the customer contract no significant changes. The Group is reviewing customer contracts for presence of variable considerations such as discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives, performance bonuses, penalties and/or any other compensations received from clients. The Group is not able to make a proper and reliable assessment of the quantitative impact of the new standard. The Group will report the estimated impact of IFRS 15 on the financials in the second quarter of 2017. The Group leases office buildings, warehouses, machinery and equipment and cars. For the year 2016 the Group recognizes an expense in the income statement of EUR 34.7 million and reports a contingent liability relating these assets of EUR 145.4 as per December 31, 2016 (see note 6.2). Under IFRS 16 the most of these contracts classify as leases because the Group has the right to control the assets. Under IFRS 16 the asset value of these assets will be recorded as Property, plant and equipment and the corresponding lease liability will be recorded as a liability. Besides the lease expenses will be transferred from the Other operating expenses to Depreciation, Amortization and impairments and Finance expenses. The Group is reviewing the lease contracts, identifying proper measurements and establishing the transition method. At this moment the Group is not able to make a proper and reliable assessment of the quantitative impact of the new standard. ----- 2.20 Segment reporting Refresco’s operating segments are Europe and US that engage in business activities from which they earn revenues and incur expenses and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Executive Board, being the Chief Operating Decision Maker, to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and to assess their performance. Europe is centrally organized to maximize operational efficiencies, synergies, and funding through its headquarters in Rotterdam. The central activities include decisions related to allocating resources, (central) sales, operations and footprint, financing of the Group, procurement, major investments and acquisitions, human resources, treasury, reporting and ICT. In order to use its European footprint for reduction of production and transportation costs, and to be close to local clients, the segment Europe has seven regionally focused business units, which focus on (local) sales and production. US is centrally organized, with the headquarter in Tulsa, Oklahoma and has three regionally-focused business units, which focus on (local) sales and production. The segments’ performance is evaluated against several measures, of which operating income is the most important. Intersegment sales are executed under normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to unrelated third parties. Net sales are attributed to geographic regions based on the location of stores. The segment reporting is disclosed in note 4.1 and the entity-wide disclosures have been included in note 4.1, 5.1 and 5.2. ----- 3 financial risk management 3.1 **Financial risk The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk (including foreign currency risk, fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk and price risk). The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. The Executive Board has the responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk management framework of the Group. Risk management policies of the Group are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and in the activities of the Group. Through its training program and its management standards and procedures, the Group aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and responsibilities. The Supervisory Board oversees management’s monitoring of compliance with the risk management policies and procedures of the Group and it reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. 3.1.1 Credit risk Credit risk represents the risk that counter parties fail to meet their contractual obligations, and arises principally in the receivables from customers, cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions. The Group does not have any significant concentration of credit risk. In order to reduce the exposure to credit risk, the Group carries out ongoing credit evaluations of the financial position of customers but generally does not require collateral. Use is made of a combination of independent ratings and risk controls to assess the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors. Sales are subject to payment conditions which are common practice in each country. The banks and financial institutions used as counterparty for holding cash and cash equivalents and deposits and in derivative transactions can be classified as high credit quality financial institutions (minimal A rating Standard & Poor’s). The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to individual financial institutions. Management believes that the likelihood of losses arising from credit risk is remote particularly in the light of the diversification of activities.

Based on historic default rates, the Group believes that no impairment loss has occurred in respect of trade receivables not past due or past due by up to 60 days. 3.1.2 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The approach of the Group to managing liquidity risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it always has sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and more extreme conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the reputation of the Group. The Group has a clear focus on financing long term growth as well as current operations. Strong cost and cash management and controls over working capital and capital expenditure proposals are in place to ensure effective and efficient allocation of financial resources. The contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements, if applicable, are as shown in the following table. Insofar as these cash flows depend on future floating interest rates, which were unknown on the balance sheet date, the cash flows have been estimated on the basis of rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.

At any point in time the Group hedges 80 to 100% of its foreign currency exposure on contracted forecasted purchases. The Group uses currency option contracts and forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risks, most of which have a maturity date of less than one year from the reporting date. When necessary, foreign currency contracts are rolled over on maturity. In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates, as necessary, to address short term imbalances. In order to minimize the impact of accounting mismatches in the profit or loss account, the Group applies cash flow hedge accounting. The effectiveness of the hedge relationship is measured based on changes in intrinsic value of options and fair value of forward contracts. The changes in time value of the currency options are directly recorded in the income statement, as part of raw material costs. Per year-end the cash flow hedge accounting relationships were fully effective. There are no forecasted transactions for which hedge accounting has been applied, but which are no longer expected to occur. The fair value of foreign currency instruments per reporting date is EUR 9.7 million debit (2015: EUR 4.1 million debit). The Group records a hedge reserve of EUR 5.0 million profit net of deferred taxes in equity (2015: EUR 1.6 million profit) relating to the effective part of the intrinsic value changes of the foreign currency option contracts and the fair value of the forward contracts. During 2016 and 2015 no amounts were recorded in raw material costs due to ineffectiveness. The amounts deferred in equity at year-end are expected to occur and to affect profit or loss for majority in 2016. All of the resulting fair value estimates are included in Level 2.

On fixed interest receivables and liabilities, it is exposed to market value fluctuations. For certain variable interest rate long term liabilities, the Group has entered into interest rate swap agreements through which the Group effectively pays fixed interest rates on these liabilities. The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting to offset the profit or loss impact resulting of timing differences between variable interest rate liabilities and the interest rate swap. Throughout the year 2015 and 2016 as well as per year-end the cash flow hedge accounting relationships were effective. ----- The fair value of interest rate swaps per reporting date is EUR (11.9) million (2015: EUR (10.2) million). The effective part of the fair value changes of the interest rate swaps amounts to EUR 5.0 million loss net of deferred taxes in Other comprehensive income (2015: EUR 3.1 million loss). In 2016 no amount (2015: EUR 0.1 million) was moved from the hedge reserve to financing costs. The amounts deferred in equity at year-end are expected to affect financing costs within the coming six years. All of the resulting fair value estimates are included in Level 2. Profile At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments was as follows: (x 1 million euro) Note Carrying amount 2016 2015 Variable rate instruments Syndicated term loan and Mortgage loan **5.10** 753.1 554.6 Non-current investments **5.3** (3.1) (3.2) Net cash as per December 31, 2016 **5.7** (131.8) (95.7) 618.2 455.7 Notional amount interest rate swaps per year-end (floating to fixed) (556.3) (495.9) Net position excluding cash 61.9 (40.2) As at balance sheet date, interest rates were fixed on approximately 90.0% of the financial liability positions including the cash position as per balance date. The Group policy is to hedge 90 to 100% of the forecasted net interest rate risk, including a forecasted cash position. Per end of 2016 the forecasted position is in line with this policy. Sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and the Group does not designate derivatives (interest rate swaps) as hedging instruments under a fair value hedge accounting model. Therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not have affected profit or loss. Sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments A change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have changed equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown in table below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant. December 31, 2016 (x 1 million euro) Profit/(loss) OCI debit/(credit)",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

To manage these risks procurement operates within the framework of centrally specified policies and guidelines and must act in conformance with the required internal control measures. The Group contract positions are based on a thorough understanding of the raw material markets and in principle contracted sales are covered back-to-back. The Group centralizes the procurement of raw materials, packaging materials and indirect spend for Europe. Authority levels of local management have been shifted towards the Group central procurement organization which is executing and monitoring the main contracts and important purchase decisions. Commodities are only purchased locally after approval of the central purchasing department. Contracts exceeding predefined limits must be authorized by the Executive Board. Existing contract positions are closely monitored and, when necessary, corrective actions are evaluated and implemented. To enable the Group to stay abreast of the current situation in the raw materials markets and maintain its gross margins, it implements pass-on clauses into sales contracts with customers. In parallel, the quality of management information has been enhanced by the development of a network enabling knowledge of markets, suppliers and conditions of raw materials to be shared at Group level. The Group hedges the raw material aluminum through derivatives. The fair value of this raw material derivative is recognized in profit and loss. The fair value per year-end is EUR 0.8 million (2015: EUR (0.6) million). Pension risk The Group contributes to a number of defined benefit plans that provide pension benefits to employees upon retirement in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and the UK. The amount of the benefits depends on age, salary and years of service. Furthermore, the Group has an indemnity plan in France and obligations for jubilee in the Netherlands, Germany and France. The financial figures are affected by the market interest rates and fair value of listed bonds and equity shares included in plan assets. We refer to note 5.11. ----- 3.2 **Capital management The policy of the Group is to maintain a sufficient capital base to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. For the purpose of the Group’s objective to maintain a sufficient capital base, the Group manages the Net debt ratio calculated as the Net debt divided by the last twelve months Adjusted EBITDA.

The mark-up for interest payable for the syndicated term loan and revolving credit facility is also depended on the Net debt ratio. See note 5.10. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the requirements of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. 3.3 **Determination of fair values A number of the accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the methods set out below. Where applicable further information regarding the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability. Property, plant and equipment The fair value of property, plant and equipment recognized as a result of a business combination is based on market values. The market value of property is the estimated amount for which a property would likely be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion. The market value of items of machinery and equipment and other fixed assets is based on the quoted market prices for similar items. Other intangible assets The fair value of brands and sales channels acquired in a business combination is determined based on the relief of royalty method. The fair value of other intangible assets is based on the discounted cash flows expected to be derived from the use and eventual sale of these assets. ----- Inventories The fair value of inventories acquired in a business combination is determined based on the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale and less a reasonable profit margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories. Trade and other receivables The fair value of trade and other receivables equal the carrying amount due to the short term nature. Levels of financial instruments The Group defines the following different levels of fair value: - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2) - Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (Level 3) Non-derivative financial liabilities Fair value for disclosure purposes is based on their listed market price, if available. If a listed market price is not available, the fair value is estimated by calculating of the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For finance leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements. Fair values The carrying amounts of other financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair value as they have variable interest rates and the impact of discounting is therefore not significant. The following table presents the Group’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at December 31, 2016. See note 5.8 for disclosures of assets held for sale that are measured at fair value.

In the absence of such an election, financial assets and liabilities will be settled on a gross basis; however, each party to the master netting agreement will have the option to settle all such amounts on a net basis in the event of default of the other party. 3.5 **Use of estimates and judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the European Union requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, especially the periodical review of useful lives and residual values of property plant and equipment. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any subsequent periods affected. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Judgments In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgments, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements: Held for sale In 2016 the Board of Directors announced its decision to close the Nieszawa plant in Poland. The plant is not yet available for sale. Management considered that the the criteria to be classified as held for sale are not met as per December 31, 2016. ----- Segmentation Refresco’s management defines the operating segments Europe and US in the context of IFRS 8. Because of the high level of centralization and integration within Europe, the Group considers Europa as one segment. The core functions for Europe are performed at the headquarter in Rotterdam and the Group applies the Pan European approach to its Europe operations. The core functions for US are performed separately from the Europe operations. Contract manufacturing Contract manufacturing consists of the provision of manufacturing services and sale of the resultant product. The nature and the risk profile of the contract with the customer are key in determining whether the Group is providing a manufacturing service or is selling a product. The revenue is recognized solely for the activities, ingredients and materials for which the Group is the principal and has the risk and rewards. Estimates The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below. Estimated goodwill The group estimates the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired by acquisitions. This measurement is provisional and can be adjusted within 12 months after the date of each acquisition. The acquisitions are recorded in note 6.1. Estimated impairment of goodwill The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2.10. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations and are recorded in note 5.2. These calculations require the use of estimates. Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes. The Group recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made. Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation techniques. The Group uses its judgment to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at the end of each reporting period. Additional information is disclosed in note 2.3. Pension benefits The present value of the pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost (income) for pensions include the discount rate. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of pension obligations. The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligation. Other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions. Additional information is disclosed in note 5.11. Information for other areas of estimation and critical judgment used in applying accounting policies can be found in the following notes: - Note 2.8: Leased assets - Note 3: Financial risk management - Note 5.1: Property plant and equipment - Note 5.2: Intangible assets - Note 5.12: Other provisions ----- 4 notes to the consolidated income statement 4.1 **Segment reporting Refresco’s operations are presented in two reportable segments Europe and US.

The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are based on value-in-use calculations. Value-in-use was determined by discounting the future pre-tax cash flows generated from the continuing use of the unit using a pre-tax discount rate and was based on the following key assumptions: - Cash flows were projected based on the current operating results and the 3-year business plan covering the period 2017-2019, which is approved by the Executive and Supervisory Board. Future cash flows beyond this period were extrapolated using a growth rate which is based on the growth expectations of the local market. These growth expectations are retrieved from researches of independent external sources. The growth rates are in a range of 0.5% to 2.3% and are considered conservative taking into account the expected private label market development. The company takes into account production efficiency improvements, waste reduction and cost reduction programs, which will contribute positive to the future cash flows. Management believes that this forecast period was appropriate to the long term nature of the business. - A pre-tax discount rate is based on credit risk per country, a weighted average cost of capital applicable to the industry and the applicable tax rate per cash generating unit.

In 2016 EUR 0.34 per share was paid, being 35.6% of the annual adjusted net income. At the Annual General Meeting on May 9, 2017, Refresco’ s Executive Board will propose a cash dividend of EUR 0.38 per share for the financial year 2016, an increase of 11.8% versus 2015. Legal reserves Within the other reserves the hedge reserve interest rate swap, hedge reserve FX instruments and currency translation reserve are legal reserves. Within these legal reserves the negative amount for hedge reserve interest rate swap should be taken into account for dividend distribution. Earnings per share (EPS) Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. The number of outstanding ordinary shares of 81,160,915 shares has not changed during 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015 the number of shares has been determined on 79.5 million by applying 74.3 million shares to the period until March 27, 2015 and applying 81.2 million shares to the period from March 27 until December 31. ----- For the year ended December 31, 2015 the accrual for cumulative dividend on A1A and A1B shares is taken into account in the calculation of the earnings per share. These shares do not exist anymore after March 27, 2015. Therefore, a pro forma EPS is calculated based on a profit without adjustment for the accrual for cumulative dividend. Hence, this pro forma profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent is EUR 5.7 million higher in the pro forma EPS calculation for 2015.

However, the assets in the Netherlands have duration in line with the liabilities. The Plan in the UK holds investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while these assets are expected to provide real returns over the long term, the short term volatility can cause additional funding to be required if deficits emerge. - Changes in bond yields: The Plan’s liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the liabilities. As the Plan holds assets such as equities the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way. A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans’ bond holdings. The pension plan in the Netherlands is an insured plan, but additional pension premiums have to be paid when interest rates are below certain levels. - Inflation risk: Some of the Group pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation or inflation increases are only possible after excessive returns on assets). - Life expectancy: The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities. - The Group operates unfunded pension and jubilee plans, where the company meets the benefit payment obligation as it falls due. Future payments depend on salary developments, changes in life expectancy and turnover rates which might result in fluctuations in cash flows. Multi-employer plan Part of the company’s employees in the Netherlands, approximately 350 employees, participate in an industry-wide multi-employer plan, ‘Stichting Bedrijfstakpensioenfonds voor de Drankindustrie’ (the pension fund). The pension plan classifies as a multi-employer plan under IAS 19. This multi-employer plan covers approximately 300 companies and 4,000 contributing members. The pension fund monitors its risks on an overall basis, not by company or employee, and is subject to regulation by Dutch governmental authorities. By law (the Dutch Pension Act), a multi-employer plan must be monitored against specific criteria, including the policy funding ratio of the plan assets to its obligations. Since January 2015, a pension fund has the obligation to report the policy funding ratio, which is the average of the funding ratio of the last 12 months. This policy funding ratio must exceed 104.2% for the total plan. Every company participating in the multi-employer plan contributes a premium calculated as a percentage of its total pensionable salaries, with each company subject to the same percentage contribution rate. The premium can fluctuate and is set by the pension fund board in accordance with (minimum) premium requirements (kostendekkende premie) as required by regulation. In the case of a shortfall (or surplus) the Company has no obligation to pay (or receive) any supplementary contributions other than possibly higher (lower) future premiums. The pension rights of each employee are based upon the employee’s average salary during employment. The policy funding ratio of the multi-employer plan decreased to 108.4% as of December 31, 2016 as reported in January 2017 (December 31, 2015: 113.9%). The policy funding ratio is calculated by dividing the plan assets by the total sum of pension liabilities and is based on actual market interest (including a so called new Ultimate Forward Rate as required by the Dutch Central Bank). The pension premium percentage is approximately 26.9% (17.1% employer, 9.8% employee) for 2016 and 2017. The multi-employer scheme is a defined benefit scheme but the Company accounts for the multi-employer plan as if it were a defined contribution plan, as the pension fund is not able to provide the Company with the required Company-specific information to allow the assets and liabilities to be separately identified. The Company’s pension expense for the multi-employer plan for a fiscal period is equal to the required contribution for that period. ----- 5.12 **Other provisions (x 1 million euro) Restructuring Other Total 2016 Total 2015 January 1** 2.3 5.7 8.0 18.8 Provisions made during the year 0.1 1.2 1.3 5.6 Provisions used during the year (1.7) (6.0) (7.7) (16.1) Provisions reversed during the year - (0.1) (0.1) (0.2) Business combinations - 4.1 4.1 Effect of movements in exchange rates - - - (0.1)",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

DIS is engaged in contract filling of drinks in cans. The acquisition price for the shares of DIS amounts to EUR 71.9 million. Together with the refinanced debt of DIS of EUR 8.6 million the Group funded the acquisition by EUR 80.0 million drawn revolving credit facility and the rest of EUR 0.5 million by available cash. On May 31, 2016, Refresco acquired the German PepsiCo plant in Hamburg of Punica Getränke GmbH (‘Hamburg’). The acquisition concerns besides the plant, selected assets and liabilities, employees, a service level agreement and a manufacturing agreement with PepsiCo. This plant is engaged in producing non-alcoholic beverages in aseptic PET bottles and glass bottles. This transaction enables the Group to strengthen the footprint in Germany and increase the Co-Packing volumes. The net acquisition price amounts to EUR 14.3 million and is funded by available cash of the Group. As per September 7, 2016 Refresco closed the acquisition of Whitlock Holding Corporation (hereafter Whitlock), taking the first step into another continent North America. Whitlock has long-standing relationships with leading A-brands in the US soft drinks market. Refresco intends to leverage its experience to further develop Whitlock’s private label capabilities. It will contribute to Whitlock’s expansion with a focus on innovation, procurement, operational excellence and industry best practices. The acquisition price for the shares of Whitlock of USD 68.2 million (EUR 60.7 million) and refinanced debt amounts to USD 59.7 million (EUR 53.1 million) are funded by the syndicated bank loan. The EUR/USD exchange rate at acquisition date is 1.12.

Impact of acquisition on the results of the Group The results of DIS are consolidated in the results of Refresco as of May 11, 2016. The revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes EUR 66.4 million in respect of DIS. The profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes a profit of EUR 4.6 million in respect of DIS. Had the acquisition of DIS been effected at January 1, 2016, the revenue of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2016 would have been increased by EUR 32.5 million and the profit for the year would have been increased by EUR 1.7 million. Management of the Group considers these pro-forma numbers to represent an approximate measure of the performance of the combined group on a year basis and to provide a reference point for comparison in future periods. The results of Hamburg are consolidated in the results of Refresco as of May 31, 2016. The revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes EUR 10.5 million in respect of the Hamburg plant and the profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes no considerable value yet in respect of the Hamburg plant. Because of the acquired assets and liabilities and the service level agreement with PepsiCo starting as from acquisition date, management of the Group considers pro-forma numbers relating to the Hamburg plant as per January 1, 2016 not to be an approximate measure of the performance of the combined group. The results of Whitlock are consolidated in the results of Refresco as of September 7, 2016. The revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes EUR 38.9 million in respect of Whitlock.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements” section of our report. We are independent of Refresco Group N.V. in accordance with the Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics). We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Materiality Materiality** € 9.1 million Benchmark applied** 1 per cent of consolidated gross margin. Explanation** The users of the financial statements of a for-profit entity typically focus on operating performance, particularly profit before tax. However, given the significant exceptional amounts in profit before tax over recent years, we applied the materiality based on gross margin. Gross margin is the most important parameter for (local) management for directing and supervising the company. All significant decisions, such as investment decisions, are based on gross margin. We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons. We agreed with the supervisory board that misstatements in excess of € 365,000, which are identified during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds. Scope of the group audit Refresco Group N.V. is the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated financial statements of Refresco Group N.V. Our group audit included all eight European components of Refresco Group N.V. This means that an audit has been performed on the complete set of financial information of each European component, thereby obtaining more than 95% coverage over the group’s total assets, revenue and result. All European components are audited by EY, whereby we used the work of local EY auditors when auditing foreign entities. The group audit team provided detailed instructions to all European component auditors, that covered significant audit areas including the relevant risks of material misstatement, and set out the information required to be reported back to the group audit team. The group audit team visited certain component auditors, based on a rotation scheme. In addition the group audit team attended all closing meetings of the European component audit teams during the hard close and the year-end audit. During these visits and calls, the findings and observations reported to the group audit team were discussed in more detail. Any further work deemed necessary by the group audit team was subsequently performed. Furthermore, based on our assessment of the newly acquired US entities, we concluded that specific procedures are required for these ----- components. The group audit team therefore visited the US in October 2016 and January 2017. During these visits the group audit team audited the purchase price allocation including the opening balance sheet and had several meetings with local management and the local auditor. Finally, The group audit team performed audit procedures with respect to certain accounts on the consolidated level, such as the valuation of goodwill. By performing the procedures mentioned above at group entities, together with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group’s financial information to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. Our key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the supervisory board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. As part of the preparation of the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, management should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements. The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process. Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion. ----- Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not have detected all material errors and fraud. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit included e.g.: - Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control - Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control - Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management - Concluding on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern - Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures - Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items. We communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identify during our audit. We provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with the supervisory board, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.

Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has: - Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee) - Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee - The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights result in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: - The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee - Rights arising from other contractual arrangements - The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity while any resultant gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognized at fair value. The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of ----- Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

The Group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to minimize the effects of fluctuations of foreign currencies and interest rates in the profit or loss. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. The method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting. The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized in the income statement immediately. When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when it is recognized. In other cases the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred to the same line of profit or loss in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss.

If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated annually. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-generating units”). For the purpose of impairment testing, the goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognized in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (or group of units) on a pro rata basis.

At any point in time the Group hedges 80 to 100% of its foreign currency exposure on contracted forecasted purchases. The Group uses currency option contracts and forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risks, most of which have a maturity date of less than one year from the reporting date. When necessary, foreign currency contracts are rolled over on maturity. In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates, as necessary, to address short-term imbalances. In order to minimize the impact of accounting mismatches in the profit or loss account, the Group applies cash flow hedge accounting. The effectiveness of the hedge relationship is measured based on changes in intrinsic value of options and fair value of forward contracts. The changes in time value of the currency options are directly recorded in the income statement, as part of raw material costs. Per year end the cash flow hedge accounting relationships were fully effective. There are no forecasted transactions for which hedge accounting has been applied, but which are no longer expected to occur. The fair value of foreign currency instruments per reporting date is EUR 4.1 million debit (2014: EUR 7.8 million debit: EUR 9.3 million debit; EUR 1.5 million credit credit).

However, the assets in the Netherlands have duration in line with the liabilities. The Plan in the UK holds investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while these assets are expected to provide real returns over the long-term, the short-term volatility can cause additional funding to be required if deficits emerge. - Changes in bond yields: The Plan’s liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the liabilities. As the Plan holds assets such as equities the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way. A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans’ bond holdings. The pension plan in the Netherlands is an insured plan, but additional pension premiums have to be paid when interest rates are below certain levels. - Inflation risk: Some of the Group pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation or inflation increases are only possible after excessive returns on assets). - Life expectancy: The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities. - The Group operates unfunded pension and jubilee plans, where the company meets the benefit payment obligation as it falls due. Future payments depend on salary developments, changes in life expectancy and turnover rates which might result in fluctuations in cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623
213_2,Offerings 2018.md,363,GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMS,363.548,Multi-employer plan,363.548.1,,"Part of the company’s employees in the Netherlands, approximately 200 employees, participate in an industry-wide multi-employer plan, “Stichting Bedrijfstakpensioenfonds voor de Drankindustrie”. (the pension fund). The pension plan classifies as a multi-employer plan under IAS 19. This multiemployer plan covers approximately 300 companies and 4,000 contributing members. The pension fund monitors its risks on an overall basis, not by company or employee, and is subject to regulation by Dutch governmental authorities. By law (the Dutch Pension Act), a multi-employer plan must be monitored against specific criteria, including the policy funding ratio of the plan assets to its obligations. Since January 2015, a pension fund has the obligation to report the policy funding ratio, which is the average of the funding ratio of the last 12 months. This policy funding ratio must exceed 104.2% for the total plan. Every company participating in the multi-employer plan contributes a premium calculated as a percentage of its total pensionable salaries, with each company subject to the same percentage contribution rate. The premium can fluctuate and is set by the pension fund board in accordance with (minimum) premium requirements (Kostendekkende premie) as required by regulation. In the case of a shortfall (or surplus) the Company has no obligation to pay (or receive) any supplementary contributions other than possibly higher (lower) future premiums. The pension rights of each employee are based upon the employee’s average salary during employment. The policy funding ratio of the multi-employer plan decreased to 113.9% as of December 31, 2015 as reported in January 2016 (December 31, 2014: 119.0%). The policy funding ratio is calculated by dividing the plan assets by the total sum of pension liabilities and is based on actual market interest (including a so called new Ultimate Forward Rate as required by the Dutch Central Bank). The pension premium percentage is approximately 24.0% in 2015 (15.3% employer, 8.7% employee) and 26.9% in 2016 (17.1% employer, 9.8% employee). The multi-employer scheme is a defined benefit scheme but The Company accounts for the multi-employer plan as if it were a defined contribution plan, as the pension fund is not able to provide the Company with the required Company-specific information to allow the assets and liabilities to be separately identified. The Company’s pension expense for the multi-employer plan for a fiscal period is equal to the required contribution for that period. |Col1|Less than one year|Year 2|Year 3 up to and including year 5|Year 6 up to and including year 10|Total| |---|---|---|---|---|---| |(x 1 million euro) Pensions & other|3.6|2.9|9.9|19.1|35.5| -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

In accordance with EU-IFRS, Refresco Gerber N.V. is required to perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis. The goodwill is allocated to eight Cash Generating Units (CGU). The annual goodwill test was performed in October 2015 and updated to 31 December 2015, consistent with prior year, resulting in sufficient headroom concerning the carrying value of goodwill. These impairment tests are significant to our audit because the assessment process is complex and requires management judgment, and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market conditions.|As part of our audit procedures we focused on the assumptions and methodologies used by the company, but also the robustness of the planning process and whether the company is able to prepare reliable estimates. Given the complexity around this topic, we have used an EY valuation specialist to assist us in evaluating the assumptions and methodologies. The company uses assumptions with respect to Weighted Average Cost of Capital, future market and economic conditions such as expected inflation rates, economic growth rates, volumes, gross margin and expenses. In order to assess the reasonability of input data, the valuation model and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital we have, among others, compared the data with external data such as expected inflation rates, external market growth expectations and we have analyzed sensitivities in the company’s valuation model. In case of the sensitivities we specifically focused on the available headroom present in the CGUs and whether a reasonable possible change in assumptions (assumed to be 1%), such as the discount rate and the growth rate could cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount. We also focused on the adequacy of the company’s disclosures regarding assumptions. As the goodwill test is performed on the 31 October 2015 numbers, per 31 December 2015, we have assessed management’s assessment whether there are any impairment indicators.| |---|---|",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

The Transaction was structured as a sale of the assets of the Canadian business and a sale of the stock of the operating subsidiaries engaged in the Cott Traditional Business in the other jurisdictions after the Company completed an internal reorganization. The aggregate deal consideration was $1.25 billion, paid at closing in cash, subject to adjustment for indebtedness, working capital, and other customary post-closing adjustments. The Cott Traditional Business excludes the Company’s Route Based Services and Coffee, Tea and Extract Solutions reporting segments, its Aimia, Decantae and RCI concentrate businesses and its Columbus, Georgia manufacturing facility. The Cott Traditional Business produces, either directly through third-party manufacturers or through co-packing arrangements, CSD, 100% shelf stable juice and juice-based products, clear, still and sparkling flavored waters, energy drinks and shots, sports drinks, new age beverages, ready-to-drink teas, liquid enhancers, freezables, and ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages. � The Company and Refresco have entered into a Transition Services Agreement pursuant to which the Company and Refresco will provide certain services to each other for various service periods, with the longest service period being 18 months, including tax and accounting services, certain human resources services, communications systems and support, and insurance/risk management. Each party will be compensated for services rendered as set forth in the Transition Services Agreement. Each service period may be extended as set forth in the Transition Services Agreement, up to a maximum extension of 180 days. In addition, the Company and Refresco have entered into certain Co-pack Manufacturing Agreements pursuant to which the Company and Refresco will manufacture and supply certain beverage products for each other and a Concentrate Supply Agreement pursuant to which the Company will supply concentrates to Refresco. Each party will be compensated for the products they supply as set forth in the applicable agreements. The Co-pack Manufacturing Agreements provide for a term of 36 months and the Concentrate Supply Agreement provides for a term that is coterminous with the term of the Transition Services Agreement.

213_2,Offerings 2018.md,868,COTT TRADITIONAL BUSINESS COMBINED CARVE-OUT STATEMENT OF EQUITY,868.5,Principles of combined carve-out financial statements,868.5.1,,"These combined carve-out financial statements include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of each reporting segment included in the Cott Traditional Business, comprising Cott’s North America reporting segments, its U.K. reporting segments (except for the Aimia Foods business), as well as the Mexico and RCI finished goods export businesses of the “All other” reporting segment (i.e., excludes RCI International division) and are presented on a combined carve-out basis to include the historical results of operations, financial position, and cash flows applicable to the Cott Traditional Business. The asset, liabilities, revenues and expenses included in these combined carve-out financial statements represent only those that were sold to Refresco and certain allocated expenses as deemed appropriate by management for the users of these financial statements as disclosed in the accompanying notes. Management believes the assumptions underlying the historical combined carve-out financial statements, including the allocations described below, are reasonable. However, these combined carve-out financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of the historical results that would have been obtained if the Cott Traditional Business had been a separate company during the periods presented or the results that may be obtained in the future. All intercompany balances and transactions within the Cott Traditional Business have been eliminated. Transactions and balances between the Cott Traditional Business and Cott and its subsidiaries are reflected as related party transactions within these combined carve-out financial statements. Cott’s net investment in the Traditional Business (invested equity) includes the net assets of this business, as well as the accumulated earnings (losses) of the Traditional Business and transactions with Cott. The accompanying combined carve-out financial statements include the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses that are specifically identifiable to the Cott Traditional Business being sold to Refresco, as well as certain allocations as described below: _General corporate expenses_ Total corporate costs included in the combined carve-out financial statements, including the amounts allocated, amounted to $56.6 million for the year ended December 30, 2017. General corporate expenses are included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the combined carve-out statement of operations. The costs associated with these general corporate costs have been allocated to the Cott Traditional Business using the most meaningful allocation methodologies, which were based primarily on time surveys (direct costs) and actual revenue (indirect costs). The general corporate expense allocations which were not directly or indirectly attributable to the Cott Traditional Business are primarily for legal, treasury, insurance, finance, internal audit, strategy and public affairs, and amounted to $7.8 million for the year ended December 30, 2017. The costs allocated are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the Cott Traditional Business had performed the functions as a stand-alone entity, nor are they indicative of costs that will be incurred in the future. Following the closing of the sale of the Cott Traditional Business and the expiration of the Transition Services Agreement, the Cott Traditional Business will perform these functions using its own resources. _Stock-based compensation_ For the year ended December 30, 2017, share-based compensation expense in the combined carve-out statement of operations included the Cott expenses related to the directly attributable fair value of awards held by certain employees of the Cott Traditional Business during the period presented. Additionally, there was an allocation for certain employees of Cott’s corporate function, calculated based on time studies and actual revenues. These expenses are not necessarily indicative of what the expenses would have been had the Cott Traditional Business been a separate stand-alone company during the year ended December 30, 2017. _Retirement plans_ During the year ended December 30, 2017, certain employees in the carve-out entities participated in pension plans sponsored and administered by entities included in the Cott Traditional Business. An attribution of assets and obligations, and an allocation of the related pension expenses, was reflected in the combined carve-out financial statements on the basis of historical amounts included within these reporting units. In the case of legal plan separations in the United States, ERISA (Employment Retirement Security Act of 1974) includes explicit guidance on how the plan assets must be allocated, which may differ from the preliminary allocation used in the combined carve-out financial statements. The amounts recorded in the financial statements and the finalized ERISA allocation could be materially different. 10 ----- _Interest Expense (Income) and Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs — net_ Third party long-term debt specific to the Cott Traditional Business has been reflected in Note 13 to the combined carve-out financial statements. The interest expense included in these combined carve-out financial statements includes interest expense related to the long-term debt included in the balance sheet. In addition, certain Cott legal entities outside the Cott Traditional Business incurred third party debt and provided intercompany financing to the Cott Traditional Business. This financing is recognized in the combined carve-out balance sheet as of December 30, 2017 as amounts due to Cott within _Related party notes payable and is interest-bearing as described in Note 19 – Related Party Transactions. As a result of this_ arrangement, the combined carve-out financial statements for the year ended December 30, 2017 include related party interest expense (and interest payable) at the exchange amount, which is the amount established and agreed to by the related parties. Interest expense included in these combined carve-out financial statements is not necessarily indicative of the interest charges that would have been incurred had the Cott Traditional Business functioned as a stand-alone company. In addition, historically, certain legal entities included in the Cott Traditional Business have incurred third party debt and provided intercompany financing to other Cott business units outside the Cott Traditional Business. This financing is recognized in the combined carve-out balance sheet as of December 30, 2017 as amounts due from Cott within Related party _notes receivable and is interest-bearing as described in Note 19 – Related Party Transactions. As a result of this arrangement,_ the combined carve-out financial statements for the year ended December 30, 2017 include related party interest income (and interest receivable) at the exchange amount. Interest income included in these combined carve-out financial statements is not necessarily indicative of the interest charges that would have been incurred had the Cott Traditional Business functioned as a stand-alone company. _Income taxes_ Income taxes are calculated as if all of the Cott Traditional Business operations had been a series of separate taxpaying legal entities, filing separate tax returns in their local tax jurisdiction. Accordingly, the tax provision for the combined carveout financial statements was prepared using the separate-return method, in which taxable income or loss is calculated as if the carve-out operations represented a taxable group that is separate from the existing parent. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax attributes and related deferred taxes associated with the legal entities that the combined carve-out financial statements comprise, as well as adjustments arising from any cost allocations recorded as part of the carve-out process. Certain income tax balance sheet items included in these combined carve-out financial statements are adjusted through Net Parent Investment and thus do not necessarily reflect the Cott Traditional Business as a stand-alone company. _Intangible Assets_ Cott has directly attributed historical intangible assets to the Cott Traditional Business based on the historical carrying amounts attributed to the Cott Traditional Business. With respect to all intangible assets, this attribution of specifically identifiable intangible assets to the Cott Traditional Business is not necessarily indicative of the fair value allocated to the intangible asset by Refresco upon the completion of the transaction. _Goodwill_ Cott has directly attributed historical goodwill to the Cott Traditional Business based on the historical goodwill amounts attributed to the Cott Traditional Business. No goodwill allocation was required as the carved-out entities already held their own historical goodwill amounts when combined to form the Cott Traditional Business. This goodwill attribution is not necessarily indicative of the fair value allocated to goodwill by Refresco upon the completion of the transaction. _Earnings per share_ The Cott Traditional Business is not a separate legal entity with common shares outstanding. Therefore, historical earnings per share have not been presented in the combined carve-out financial statements. 11 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

We test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, based on our reporting unit carrying values, calculated as total assets less non-interest bearing liabilities, as of the end of the third quarter, or more frequently if we determine a triggering event has occurred during the year. Any impairment loss is recognized in our results of operations. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis, which is an operating segment or a level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. However, two or more components of an operating segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. For the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment in 2017, we have determined our reporting units are Cott North America, Cott U.K. and Mexico. We had goodwill of $136.8 million on our balance sheet at December 30, 2017, which represents amounts for the Cott North America and U.K. reporting units. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we early adopted Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2017-04, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” as part of the annual goodwill impairment testing. We have the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether any further quantitative testing for a potential impairment is necessary. Our qualitative assessment will use judgments including, but not limited to, changes in the general economic environment, industry considerations, current economic performance compared to historical economic performance, entity-specific events and events affecting our reporting units, where applicable. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine, based upon our assessment of those qualitative factors that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its net carrying value, a quantitative assessment is required. Quantitative testing requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be compared with its carrying value. If the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference. 13 ----- For purposes of the 2017 annual test, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment for our Cott North America and Cott U.K. reporting units to assess whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values. In performing these assessments, management relied on a number of factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors that would have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, overall financial performance compared with forecasted projections in prior periods, the aggregate deal consideration of $1.25 billion for the sale of the Cott Traditional Business and other relevant reporting unit events, all of which require the use of significant judgments and estimates. Based on these factors, management concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of the Cott North America and Cott U.K. reporting units were greater than their respective carrying amounts, including goodwill, indicating no impairment. Each year during the fourth quarter, we re-evaluate the assumptions used in our assessments, such as revenue growth rates, operating profit margins and discount rates, to reflect any significant changes in the business environment that could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units. Based on the evaluations performed in 2017, we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Customer relationships are typically amortized on an accelerated basis for the period over which we expect to receive the economic benefits. We review the estimated useful life of these intangible assets annually, unless a review is required more frequently due to a triggering event, such as a loss of a significant customer. Our review of the estimated useful life takes into consideration the specific net cash flows related to the intangible asset. The permanent loss of, or significant decline in sales to customers included in the intangible asset would result in either an impairment in the value of the intangible asset or an accelerated amortization of any remaining value and could lead to an impairment of the fixed assets that were used to service that customer. We did not record impairment charges for other intangible assets in 2017. Our intangible assets with indefinite lives relate to intellectual property that includes the right to manufacture our concentrates, with all related inventions, processes, technologies, technical and manufacturing information and know-how (the “Rights”). The life of the Rights is considered to be indefinite and therefore are not amortized. Rather they are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if we determine a triggering event has occurred during the year. We compare the carrying amount of the intangible asset to its fair value and when the carrying amount is greater than the fair value, we recognize in income an impairment loss. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we assessed qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Rights was less than its respective carrying value. The qualitative factors we assessed included macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors that would have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, overall financial performance compared with forecasted projections in prior periods, and other relevant events, the impact of which are all significant judgements and estimates. We concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Rights was more than its carrying value and therefore we were not required to perform any additional testing. These assets had an aggregate net book value of $20.5 million as of December 30, 2017.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, using currently enacted income tax rates. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred income tax assets if, on the basis of available evidence, it is not more likely than not that all or a portion of any deferred tax assets will be realized. The consideration of available evidence requires significant management judgment including an assessment of the future periods in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized and projections of future taxable income. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets, related to net operating losses, is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods prior to their expiration. If our estimates and assumptions about future taxable income are not appropriate, the value of our deferred tax assets may not be recoverable, which may result in an increase to our valuation allowance that will impact current earnings. We account for uncertain tax positions using a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. The second step requires management to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax benefit line in the accompanying combined carve-out statement of operations, and we include accrued interest and penalties within the income tax payable or receivable line in the combined carve-out balance sheets.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

The guidance requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. We adopted the provisions of this guidance effective January 1, 2017, and applied it prospectively to all periods presented. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our combined carve-out financial statements. 15 ----- _Update ASU 2017-04 – Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)_ In January 2017, the FASB amended its guidance regarding goodwill impairment. The amendments remove certain conditions of the goodwill impairment test and simplify the computation of impairment. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for any tests performed after January 1, 2017. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively, with disclosure required as to the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle upon transition. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we early adopted ASU 2017-04 as part of the annual goodwill impairment testing. _Update ASU 2017-12 – Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities_ In August 2017, the FASB amended its guidance regarding the improvement of accounting for hedging transactions. This new standard simplifies and expands the eligible hedging strategies for financial and non-financial risks. It also enhances the transparency of how hedging results are presented and disclosed. Further, the new standard provides partial relief on the timing of certain aspects of hedge documentation and eliminates the requirement to recognize hedge ineffectiveness separately in earnings. The guidance is designed to align hedge accounting with a company’s risk management activities and simplifies its application through targeted improvements by expanding the list of items eligible to be hedged and amending the methods used to measure the effectiveness of hedging relationships. Additionally, it prescribes how hedging results should be presented and requires incremental disclosures. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We early adopted, in an interim period, the targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities. The transition date is October 1, 2017 (“Adoption Date”). The impacts at the Adoption Date are limited to outstanding currency swaps. Adoption of ASU 2017-12 did not result in a cumulative adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings and did not have any other material effect on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Cott Traditional Business. _Update ASU 2017-13 – Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Leases (Topic 840), and Leases (Topic 842) – Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to the Staff Announcement at the July 20, 2017 EITF Meeting and Rescission of Prior SEC Staff Announcements and Observer Comments_ In August 2017, the FASB issued an update to its guidance that delays the mandatory adoption of Topic 606 and Topic 842 for certain entities, revises the guidance related to performance-based incentive fees in Topic 605 and revises the guidance related to leases in Topic 840 and Topic 842. The revisions to the lease guidance eliminate language specific to certain sale-leaseback arrangements, guarantees of lease residual assets and loans made by lessees to owner-lessors. Also included is an amendment to Topic 842 to retain the guidance in Topic 840 covering the impact of changes in tax rates on investments in leveraged leases. This standard, which is effective immediately, generally relates to the adoption of Topic 606 and Topic 842 and did not have a material impact on our combined carve-out financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

The objectives for creating Topic 606 were to remove inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue recognition, provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, provide more useful information to users of the financial statements through improved disclosure requirements, simplify the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer, and improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. The core principal of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve the core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: 1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendment recognized at the date of initial application. We are currently assessing the impact of adoption of this standard on our combined carve-out financial statements. 16 ----- _Update ASU 2016-02 – Leases (Topic 842)_ In February 2016, the FASB issued an update to its guidance on lease accounting. This update revises accounting for operating leases by a lessee, among other changes, and requires a lessee to recognize a liability to make lease payments and an asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term in the balance sheet. The distinction between finance and operating leases has not changed and the update does not significantly change the effect of finance and operating leases on the combined carve-out statement of operations and the combined carve-out statement of cash flows. Additionally, this update requires both qualitative and specific quantitative disclosures. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We are currently assessing the impact of adoption of this standard on our combined carve-out financial statements. _Update ASU 2016-13 – Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326)_ In June 2016, the FASB amended its guidance to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Entities will now use forward-looking information to better form their credit loss estimates. The amended guidance also requires enhanced disclosures to help financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an entity’s portfolio. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption will be permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. This guidance will be applied using a prospective or modified retrospective transition method, depending on the area covered in this update. We are currently assessing the impact of adoption of this standard on our combined carve-out financial statements. _Update ASU 2017-01 – Business Combination (Topic 805)_ In January 2017, the FASB amended its guidance regarding business combinations. The amendment clarified the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amendments provide an analysis of fair value of assets acquired to determine when a set is not a business, and uses more stringent criteria related to inputs, substantive process, and outputs to determine if a business exists. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date with no requirement for disclosures at transition. We are currently assessing the impact of adoption of this standard on our combined carve-out financial statements. _Update ASU 2017-07 – Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)_ In March 2017, the FASB issued an update to its guidance on presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement pension cost, and requires the service cost component to be presented in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. The amendments in this update also allow only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization when applicable. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. At adoption, this update will be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and other components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit cost in the income statement and prospectively, on or after the effective date, for the capitalization of the service cost component of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit in assets. Additionally, in the period of adoption, an entity should provide disclosures about a change in accounting principle. We are currently assessing the impact of adoption of this standard on our combined carve-out financial statements. _Update ASU 2017-08 – Receivables—Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20)_ In March 2017, the FASB amended its guidance on accounting for debt securities. The amendments shorten the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium. Specifically, the amendments require the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. The amendments do not require an accounting change for securities held at a discount; the discount continues to be amortized to maturity. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. At adoption, this update will be applied using a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Additionally, in the period of adoption, an entity should provide disclosures about a change in accounting principle. We are currently assessing the impact of adoption of this standard on our combined carve-out financial statements. 17 ----- _Update ASU 2017-09 – Stock Compensation – Scope of Modification Accounting (Topic 718)_ In May 2017, the FASB amended its guidance regarding the scope of modification accounting for share-based compensation arrangements. The amendments provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a sharebased payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. We are currently assessing the impact of adoption of this standard on our combined carve-out financial statements. _Update ASU 2018-02 – Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)_ In February 2018, the FASB amended its guidance which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the comprehensive tax legislation enacted by the U.S. government on December 22, 2017 commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) and requires certain disclosures about stranded tax effects. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and may be applied in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate in the Tax Act is recognized.

Many provisions in the Tax Act are generally effective in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. U.S. GAAP requires the impact of tax legislation to be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted. As a result of the Tax Act, we recorded tax benefit of $9.9 million due to a remeasurement of the U.S deferred tax assets and liabilities and of $0.7 million due to the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax. The tax benefits represent provisional amounts and the Company’s current best estimates. The provisional amounts incorporate assumptions made based upon the Company’s current interpretation of the Tax Act and may be refined through the fourth quarter of 2018 as the Company receives additional clarification and implementation guidance. Income taxes are calculated as if all of the Cott Traditional Business operations had been a series of separate taxpaying legal entities, filing separate tax returns in their local tax jurisdiction. As of December 30, 2017, we have outside tax basis differences, including undistributed earnings, in the separate taxpaying legal entities. We have not changed our historical indefinite reinvestment assertion as it relates to any of the entities included within the Cott Traditional Business. Additionally, there are no anticipated tax impacts related to the undistributed earnings of the Cott Traditional Business as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs act. As of December 30, 2017, we have operating loss carryforwards totaling $258.6 million, credit carryforwards totaling $2.5 million and capital loss carryforwards totaling $13.1 million. The operating loss carryforward amount was attributable to U.S. federal and state operating loss carryforwards of $215.1 million and $28.5 million, respectively that will expire from 2017 to 2037; and operating loss carryforwards of $15.0 million attributable to Mexico that will expire from 2018 to 2032. Should there be an IRC Sec. 338(h)(10) election made as a result of the future sale, the U.S. net operating losses would not be able to be utilized by the buyer in the future. The credit carryforward amount is attributable to a refundable U.S. federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of $0.7 million, and U.S. state credit carryforwards of $1.8 million that will expire from 2018 to 2022. The capital loss carryforward is attributable to U.K. capital losses of $0.2 million and Canadian capital losses of $12.9 million all with an indefinite life. 21 ----- In general, under Section 382 and 383 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), a U.S. corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (“NOLs”) or tax credits to offset future taxable income. Therefore, current or future changes in our Canadian stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control, could result in a U.S. ownership change under Section 382 and 383 of the Code. If we undergo a U.S. ownership change, our ability to utilize U.S. federal or state NOLs or tax credits could be limited. We monitor changes in our ownership on an ongoing basis and do not believe we had a change in control as of December 30, 2017. We establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of the available evidence, both positive and negative, for each respective tax jurisdiction, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Due to a cumulative loss position, we determined it is more likely than not we will not realize the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets in the U.S.; therefore, we continue to record a full valuation allowance, exclusive of non-reversing deferred tax liabilities, in the U.S. of $67.0 million for the year ended December 30, 2017. Due to uncertainty resulting from the lack of sustained taxable income in recent years in Mexico, we have determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit from net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets in this jurisdiction will not be realized in the future. In recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of $5.3 million to reduce our deferred tax assets in Mexico. Additionally, we have determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit from our capital losses in Canada will not be realized in the future due to the uncertainty regarding potential future capital gains in the jurisdiction. In recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of $3.3 million on our capital losses.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

If we recognized our tax positions, approximately $2.1 million would favorably impact the effective tax rate. We believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease or be recognized in the next twelve months by up to $0.7 million due to the settlement of certain tax positions and lapses in statutes of limitation in various tax jurisdictions. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. We recovered nil of interest and penalties during the year ended December 30, 2017. The amount of interest and penalties recognized in the combined balance sheets for 2017 were an asset of $0.1 million.

Cott amended and refinanced the ABL facility and incurred financing fees in connection therewith, in aggregate of $12.4 million. These fees have been capitalized and deferred and are recorded in other long-term assets, net and are being amortized using the straight-line method over the duration of the amended ABL facility. As of December 30, 2017, we had $220.3 million of outstanding borrowings under the ABL facility. The commitment fee was 0.375% per annum of the unused commitment of $167.3 million, which was based on Cott’s total ABL facility commitment of $500.0 million, excluding outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit. Each month’s borrowing base is not effective until submitted to the lenders, which usually occurs on the twentieth day of the following month. The weighted average effective interest rate at December 30, 2017 on the outstanding LIBOR loans was 3.1%. The effective interest rates are based on Cott’s aggregate availability. On January 30, 2018, in connection with the closing of the Transaction, Cott used a portion of the proceeds from the Transaction to repay $262.5 million of our outstanding balance on the ABL facility. _5.375% Senior Notes due in 2022_ In June 2014, we issued $525.0 million of 5.375% senior notes due 2022 (the “2022 Notes”). The issuer of the notes was Cott’s wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary Cott Beverages Inc. (“CBI”), and Cott and most of its U.S., Canadian and U.K. subsidiaries guaranteed the obligations. Cott incurred $9.6 million of financing fees in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes. The financing fees are being amortized using the effective interest method over an eight-year period, which represents the term to maturity of the 2022 Notes. On January 30, 2018, in connection with the closing of the Transaction, Cott used a portion of the proceeds from the Transaction to redeem the 2022 Notes. The redemption of the 2022 Notes included $21.2 million in premium payments and $2.2 million in accrued interest. _6.750% Senior Notes due in 2020_ In December 2014, we issued $625.0 million of 6.75% senior notes due January 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”). The issuer of the notes was CBI, and Cott and most of its U.S., Canadian and U.K. subsidiaries guaranteed the obligations. Cott incurred $14.4 million of financing fees in connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes. The financing fees are being amortized using the effective interest method over a five-year period, which represents the term to maturity of the 2020 Notes. On April 5, 2017 and March 22, 2017, Cott used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of senior notes by one of their wholly-owned subsidiaries to purchase $422.7 million and $202.3 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes. The redemption of the 2020 Notes included $14.3 million and $7.1 million in premium payments, accrued interest of $7.4 million and $3.1 million, the write-off of $5.8 million and $2.9 million in deferred financing fees, and other costs of $0.1 million. 27 ----- _GE Term Loan_ In January 2008, we entered into a capital lease finance arrangement with General Electric Capital Corporation (“GE Capital”) for the lease of equipment. In September 2013, we purchased the equipment subject to the lease for an aggregate purchase price of $10.7 million, with the financing for such purchase provided by GE Capital at 5.23% interest.

These changes in market conditions may adversely impact our financial performance and are referred to as market risks. When deemed appropriate by management, we use derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of foreign currency market risks. We use various types of derivative instruments including, but not limited to, forward contracts and swap agreements for certain commodities. Forward contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency at a predetermined future date, and at a predetermined rate or price. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. All derivatives are carried at fair value in the combined balance sheets in the line item accounts receivable, net or accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally enforceable agreements with the same counterparties. These allow us to net settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from different transactions with the same counterparty. The accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the types of hedging relationships. Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the same line item in our combined statements of operations as the changes in the fair value of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged. The changes in fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in the combined statements of operations in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged, fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments are immediately recognized into earnings. We classify cash inflows and outflows related to derivative and hedging instruments with the appropriate cash flows section associated with the item being hedged. For derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, we formally designate and document, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, we formally assess both at the inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures. We estimate the fair values of our derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates (see Note 18 to the combined carve-out financial statements). The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial risks described above. The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates or other financial indices. We do not view the fair values of our derivatives in isolation, but rather in relation to the fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged transactions. All of our derivatives are over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets. 33 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

We maintain a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that our procurement activities will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and qualified for our foreign currency cash flow hedging program was $4.4 million as of December 30, 2017.

Additionally, the inputs used to measure fair value are prioritized based on a three-level hierarchy. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows: � Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. � Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. � Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. We have certain assets and liabilities such as our derivative instruments that are required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our derivative assets represent Level 2 instruments. Level 2 instruments are valued based on observable inputs for quoted prices for similar assets in active markets.

213_2,Offerings 2018.md,874,COTT TRADITIONAL BUSINESS COMBINED CARVE-OUT STATEMENTS OF EQUITY,874.6,Principles of combined carve-out financial statements,874.6.1,,"These combined carve-out financial statements include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of each reporting segment included in the Cott Traditional Business, comprising Cott’s North America reporting segments, its U.K. reporting segments (except for the Aimia Foods business), as well as the Mexico and RCI finished goods export businesses of the “All other” reporting segment (i.e., excludes RCI International division) and are presented on a combined carve-out basis to include the historical results of operations, financial position, and cash flows applicable to the Cott Traditional Business. The asset, liabilities, revenues and expenses included in these combined carve-out financial statements represent only those that will be sold to Refresco and certain allocated expenses as deemed appropriate by management for the users of these financial statements as disclosed in the accompanying notes. Management believes the assumptions underlying the historical combined carve-out financial statements, including the allocations described below, are reasonable. However, these combined carve-out financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of the historical results that would have been obtained if the Cott Traditional Business had been a separate company during the periods presented or the results that may be obtained in the future. All intercompany balances and transactions within the Cott Traditional Business have been eliminated. Transactions and balances between the Cott Traditional Business and Cott and its subsidiaries are reflected as related party transactions within these combined carve-out financial statements. Cott’s net investment in the Traditional Business (invested equity) includes the net assets of this business, as well as the accumulated earnings (losses) of the Traditional Business and transactions with Cott. The accompanying combined carve-out financial statements include the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses that are specifically identifiable to the Cott Traditional Business being sold to Refresco, as well as certain allocations as described below: _General corporate expenses_ Total corporate costs included in the combined carve-out financial statements, including the amounts allocated, amounted to $43.7 million and $44.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, respectively. General corporate expenses are included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the combined carve-out statement of operations. The costs associated with these general corporate costs have been allocated to the Cott Traditional Business using the most meaningful allocation methodologies, which were based primarily on time surveys (direct costs) and actual revenue (indirect costs). The general corporate expense allocations which were not directly or indirectly attributable to the Cott Traditional Business are primarily for legal, treasury, insurance, finance, internal audit, strategy and public affairs, and amounted to $5.4 million and $5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, respectively. The costs allocated are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the Cott Traditional Business had performed the functions as a stand-alone entity, nor are they indicative of costs that will be incurred in the future. Following the closing of the sale of the Cott Traditional Business and the expiration of the Transition Services Agreement, the Cott Traditional Business will perform these functions using its own resources. _Stock-based compensation_ For the years ended December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, share-based compensation expense in the combined carve-out statements of operations included the Cott expenses related to the directly attributable fair value of awards held by certain employees of the Cott Traditional Business during the periods presented. Additionally, there was an allocation for certain employees of Cott’s corporate function, calculated based on time studies and actual revenues. These expenses are not necessarily indicative of what the expenses would have been had we been a separate stand-alone company during the years ended December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016. _Retirement plans_ During the years ended December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, certain employees in the carve-out entities participated in pension plans sponsored and administered by entities included in the Cott Traditional Business. An attribution of assets and obligations, and an allocation of the related pension expenses, was reflected in the combined carve-out financial statements on the basis of historical amounts included within these reporting units. In the case of legal plan separations in the United States, ERISA (Employment Retirement Security Act of 1974) includes explicit guidance on how the plan assets must be allocated, which may differ from the preliminary allocation used in the combined carve-out financial statements. The amounts recorded in the financial statements and the finalized ERISA allocation could be materially different. 10 ----- _Interest Expense (Income) and Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs — net_ Third party long-term debt specific to the Cott Traditional Business has been reflected in Note 12 to the combined carve-out financial statements. The interest expense included in these combined carve-out financial statements includes interest expense related to the long-term debt included in the balance sheet. In addition, certain Cott legal entities outside the Cott Traditional Business incurred third party debt and provided intercompany financing to the Cott Traditional Business. This financing is recognized in the combined carve-out balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016 as amounts due to Cott within Related party notes payable and is interest-bearing as described in Note 18 —Related Party Transactions. As a result of this arrangement, the combined carve-out financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016 include related party interest expense (and interest payable) at the exchange amount, which is the amount established and agreed to by the related parties. Interest expense included in these combined carve-out financial statements is not necessarily indicative of the interest charges that would have been incurred had the Traditional Business functioned as a stand-alone company. In addition, historically, certain legal entities included in the Cott Traditional Business have incurred third party debt and provided intercompany financing to other Cott business units outside the Cott Traditional Business. This financing is recognized in the combined carve-out balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016 as amounts due from Cott within Related party notes receivable and is interest-bearing as described in Note 18 —Related Party Transactions. As a result of this arrangement, the combined carve-out financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016 include related party interest income (and interest receivable) at the exchange amount. Interest income included in these combined carve-out financial statements is not necessarily indicative of the interest charges that would have been incurred had the Cott Traditional Business functioned as a stand-alone company. _Income taxes_ Income taxes are calculated as if all of the Cott Traditional Business operations had been separate taxpaying legal entities, filing separate tax returns in their local tax jurisdiction. Accordingly, the tax provision for the combined carve-out financial statements was prepared using the separate-return method, in which taxable income or loss is calculated as if the carve-out operations represented a taxable group that is separate from the existing parent. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax attributes and related deferred taxes associated with the legal entities that the combined carve-out financial statements comprise, as well as adjustments arising from any cost allocations recorded as part of the carve-out process. Certain income tax balance sheet items included in these combined carve-out financial statements are adjusted through Net Parent Investment and thus do not necessarily reflect the Traditional Business as a stand-alone company. _Intangible Assets_ Cott has directly attributed historical intangible assets to the Cott Traditional Business based on the historical carrying amounts attributed to the Cott Traditional Business. With respect to all intangibles, assuming the sale of the Cott Traditional Business described above is completed, this attribution of specifically identifiable intangibles to the Cott Traditional Business is not necessarily indicative of the fair value allocated to the intangible asset by Refresco upon the completion of the transaction. _Goodwill_ Cott has directly attributed historical goodwill to the Cott Traditional Business based on the historical goodwill amounts attributed to the Cott Traditional Business. No goodwill allocation was required as the carved-out entities already held their own historical goodwill amounts when combined to form the Cott Traditional Business. Assuming the sale of the Cott Traditional Business described above is completed, this goodwill attribution is not necessarily indicative of the fair value allocated to goodwill by Refresco upon the completion of the transaction. _Earnings per share_ The Cott Traditional Business is not a separate legal entity with common shares outstanding. Therefore, historical earnings per share have not been presented in the combined carve-out financial statements. 11 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

We test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, based on our reporting unit carrying values, calculated as total assets less interest bearing liabilities, as of the end of the third quarter, or more frequently if we determine a triggering event has occurred during the year. Any impairment loss is recognized in our results of operations. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis, which is an operating segment or a level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. However, two or more components of an operating segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. For the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment in 2016 and 2015, we have determined our reporting units are Cott North America, Cott U.K. and Mexico. As of the end of the third quarter of 2016, we re-aligned our reporting unit structure within the Cott U.K. operating segment as a result of the Calypso Soft Drinks business being absorbed into the operations of the U.K. Due to the change in reporting unit structure, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test on our Calypso Soft Drinks reporting unit as of the end of the third quarter. The assumptions used in the valuation of the reporting unit include a terminal growth rate of 1.0%, and a discount rate of 12.5%. The test did not result in an impairment charge and the assets and liabilities of Calypso Soft Drinks, including goodwill, are now included in the discrete financial information of our U.K. reporting unit. We had goodwill of $127.1 million and $127.9 million on our balance sheet at December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, respectively, which represents amounts for the Cott North America and U.K. reporting units. We have the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether any further quantitative testing for a potential impairment is necessary. Our qualitative assessment will use judgments including, but not limited to, changes in the general economic environment, industry considerations, current economic performance compared to historical economic performance, entity-specific events and events affecting our reporting units, where applicable. If we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine, based upon our assessment of those qualitative factors that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its net carrying value, a quantitative assessment is required. The quantitative test is a two-step test. The first step identifies whether there is potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the second step of the impairment test is required to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. 13 ----- For purposes of the 2016 annual test, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment for the U.K. reporting unit. In performing this assessment, management relied on a number of factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors that would have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, overall financial performance compared with forecasted projections in prior periods, and other relevant reporting unit events, the impact of which are all significant judgments and estimates. Based on these factors, management concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of the U.K. reporting unit was greater than the respective carrying amount, including goodwill, indicating no impairment. Goodwill allocated to the U.K. reporting unit as of December 31, 2016 was $6.6 million. For the Cott North America reporting unit, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative analysis due to the overall carbonated soft drink (“CSD”) industry decline impacting the Cott North America reporting unit. We determined the fair value of the reporting unit being evaluated using a mix of the income approach (which is based on the discounted cash flows of the reporting unit) and the guideline public company approach. We believe using a combination of these approaches provides a more accurate valuation because it incorporates the expected cash generation of the reporting unit in addition to how a third-party market participant would value the reporting unit. As the business is assumed to continue in perpetuity, the discounted future cash flows includes a terminal value. Critical assumptions used in our 2016 valuation of the reporting unit include the weighted-average terminal growth rate of 1.0% for the Cott North America reporting unit, and a discount rate of 8.0%. The terminal growth rate assumption incorporated into the discounted cash flow calculation reflects our long-term view of the market and industry, projected changes in the sale of our products, pricing of such products and operating profit margins. The discount rate was determined using various factors and sensitive assumptions, including bond yields, size premiums and tax rates. This rate was based on the weighted average cost of capital a market participant would use if evaluating the reporting unit as an investment. These assumptions are considered significant unobservable inputs and represent our best estimate of assumptions that market participants would use to determine the fair value of the respective reporting units. The key inputs into the discounted cash flow analysis were consistent with market data, where available, indicating that the assumptions used were in a reasonable range of observable market data. Based on the quantitative assessment including consideration of the sensitivity of the assumptions made and methods used to determine fair value, industry trends and other relevant factors, we noted that the estimated fair value of the Cott North America reporting unit exceeded the carrying values by approximately 35.2%. Therefore, a second step analysis was not required and no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016. If actual operating results in future periods are less than currently projected or if the impact to the Cott North America reporting unit resulting from the decline in the CSD industry is larger than anticipated, goodwill allocated to the reporting unit could be impaired at a future date. Goodwill allocated to the Cott North America reporting unit as of December 31, 2016 was $120.5 million. Each year during the fourth quarter, we re-evaluate the assumptions used in our assessments, such as revenue growth rates, operating profit margins and discount rates, to reflect any significant changes in the business environment that could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units. Based on the evaluations performed in 2016, we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Customer relationships are typically amortized on an accelerated straight-line basis for the period over which we expect to receive the economic benefits. We review the estimated useful life of these intangible assets annually, unless a review is required more frequently due to a triggering event, such as a loss of a significant customer. Our review of the estimated useful life takes into consideration the specific net cash flows related to the intangible asset. The permanent loss of, or significant decline in sales to customers included in the intangible asset would result in either an impairment in the value of the intangible asset or an accelerated amortization of any remaining value and could lead to an impairment of the fixed assets that were used to service that customer. We did not record impairment charges for other intangible assets in 2016 or 2015. Our intangible assets with indefinite lives relate to intellectual property that includes the right to manufacture our concentrates, with all related inventions, processes, technologies, technical and manufacturing information and know-how (the “Rights”). The life of the Rights are considered to be indefinite and therefore are not amortized. Rather they are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if we determine a triggering event has occurred during the year. We compare the carrying amount of the intangible asset to its fair value and when the carrying amount is greater than the fair value, we recognize in income an impairment loss. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we tested the Rights for impairment. 14 ----- To determine the fair value of the Rights, we use a relief from royalty method of the income approach, which calculates a fair value royalty rate that is applied to a forecast of future volume shipments of concentrate that is used to produce CSDs. The forecast of future volumes is based on the estimated shipments. The relief from royalty method is used since the Rights were purchased in part to avoid making future royalty payments for concentrate to the Royal Crown Company. The resulting cash flows are discounted using a rate to reflect the risk of achieving the projected royalty savings attributable to the Rights. The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the Rights are subjective and require significant management judgment, including estimated future volumes, the fair value royalty rate (which is estimated to be a reasonable market royalty charge that would be charged by a licensor of the Rights) and the risk adjusted discount rate. Based on our impairment tests, the estimated fair value of the Rights exceeded the carrying value for all periods presented. These assets had an aggregate net book value of $20.5 million as of December 31, 2016.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, using currently enacted income tax rates. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred income tax assets if, on the basis of available evidence, it is not more likely than not that all or a portion of any deferred tax assets will be realized. The consideration of available evidence requires significant management judgment including an assessment of the future periods in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized and projections of future taxable income. We classify interest and income tax penalties as income tax expense (benefit). The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets, related to net operating losses, is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods prior to their expiration. If our estimates and assumptions about future taxable income are not appropriate, the value of our deferred tax assets may not be recoverable, which may result in an increase to our valuation allowance that will impact current earnings. 15 ----- We account for uncertain tax positions using a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. The second step requires management to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.

The objectives for creating Topic 606 were to remove inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue recognition, provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, provide more useful information to users of the financial statements through improved disclosure requirements, simplify the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer, and improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. The core principal of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve the core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: 1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. For public entities, the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendment recognized at the date of initial application. We are currently assessing the impact of adoption of this standard on our combined carve-out financial statements. _Update ASU 2016-02 – Leases (Topic 842)_ In February 2016, the FASB issued an update to its guidance on lease accounting. This update revises accounting for operating leases by a lessee, among other changes, and requires a lessee to recognize a liability to make lease payments and an asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term in the balance sheet. The distinction between finance and operating leases has not changed and the update does not significantly change the effect of finance and operating leases on the combined statements of operations and the combined statements of cash flows. Additionally, this update requires both qualitative and specific quantitative disclosures. For public entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. At adoption, this update will be applied using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently assessing the impact of adoption of this standard on our combined carve-out financial statements. 16 ----- _Update ASU 2016-13 – Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326)_ In June 2016, the FASB amended its guidance to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Entities will now use forward-looking information to better form their credit loss estimates. The amended guidance also requires enhanced disclosures to help financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an entity’s portfolio. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption will be permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. This guidance will be applied using a prospective or modified retrospective transition method, depending on the area covered in this update. We are currently assessing the impact of adoption of this standard on our combined carve-out financial statements. _Update ASU 2017-01 – Business Combination (Topic 805)_ In January 2017, the FASB amended its guidance regarding business combinations. The amendment clarified the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amendments provide an analysis of fair value of assets acquired to determine when a set is not a business, and uses more stringent criteria related to inputs, substantive process, and outputs to determine if a business exists. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date with no requirement for disclosures at transition. We are currently assessing the impact of adoption of this standard on our combined carve-out financial statements. _Update ASU 2017-04 – Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350)_ In January 2017, the FASB amended its guidance regarding goodwill impairment. The amendments remove certain conditions of the goodwill impairment test and simplify the computation of impairment. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for any tests performed after January 1, 2017. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively, with disclosure required as to the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle upon transition. We are currently assessing the impact of adoption of this standard on our combined carve-out financial statements. _Update ASU 2017-07 – Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715)_ In March 2017, the FASB issued an update to its guidance on presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement pension cost, and requires the service cost component to be presented in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. The amendments in this update also allow only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization when applicable. For public entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. At adoption, this update will be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and other components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit cost in the income statement and prospectively, on or after the effective date, for the capitalization of the service cost component of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit in assets. Additionally, in the period of adoption, an entity should provide disclosures about a change in accounting principle. We are currently assessing the impact of adoption of this standard on our combined carve-out financial statements. _Update ASU 2017-08 – Receivables—Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20)_ In March 2017, the FASB amended its guidance on accounting for debt securities. The amendments shorten the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium. Specifically, the amendments require the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. The amendments do not require an accounting change for securities held at a discount; the discount continues to be amortized to maturity. For public entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. At adoption, this update will be applied using a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Additionally, in the period of adoption, an entity should provide disclosures about a change in accounting principle. We are currently assessing the impact of adoption of this standard on our combined carve-out financial statements. 17 ----- _Update ASU 2017-09 – Stock Compensation – Scope of Modification Accounting (Topic 718)_ In May 2017, the FASB amended its guidance regarding the scope of modification accounting for share-based compensation arrangements. The amendments provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a sharebased payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. For public entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. We are currently assessing the impact of adoption of this standard on our combined carve-out financial statements. _Update ASU 2017-12 – Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities_ In August 2017, the FASB amended it guidance regarding the improvement of accounting for hedging transactions. This new standard simplifies and expands the eligible hedging strategies for financial and nonfinancial risks. It also enhances the transparency of how hedging results are presented and disclosed. Further, the new standard provides partial relief on the timing of certain aspects of hedge documentation and eliminates the requirement to recognize hedge ineffectiveness separately in earnings. The guidance is designed to align hedge accounting with a company’s risk management activities and simplifies its application through targeted improvements by expanding the list of items eligible to be hedged and amending the methods used to measure the effectiveness of hedging relationships. Additionally it prescribes how hedging results should be presented and requires incremental disclosures. For public entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted in any interim period after issuance of the Update. We are currently assessing the impact of adoption of this standard on our combined carve-out financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

If we recognized our tax positions, approximately $2.0 million would favorably impact the effective tax rate. We believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease or be recognized in the next twelve months by up to $0.4 million due to the settlement of certain tax positions and lapses in statutes of limitation in various tax jurisdictions. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. We recovered nil of interest and penalties during the years ended December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016. The amount of interest and penalties recognized in the combined balance sheets for 2016 and 2015 were an asset of nil, and $0.1 million respectively.

As of December 31, 2016, we have outside tax basis differences, including undistributed earnings, in our foreign subsidiaries. No deferred taxes have been recorded on the undistributed earnings for any of the foreign subsidiaries primarily due to the subsidiaries ability to repatriate funds to its parent company tax-efficiently. The remaining undistributed earnings are indefinitely reinvested under the accounting guidance. In order to arrive at this conclusion, we considered factors including, but not limited to, past experience, domestic cash requirements, cash requirements to satisfy the ongoing operations, capital expenditures and other financial obligations of our subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the excess book basis over outside tax basis in the shares or the amount of incremental taxes that might arise if these earnings were to be remitted. The amount of tax payable could be significantly impacted by the jurisdiction in which a distribution was made, the amount of the distribution, foreign withholding taxes under applicable tax laws when distributed, relevant tax treaties and foreign tax credits. As of December 31, 2016, we have operating loss carryforwards totaling $199.7 million, credit carryforwards totaling $2.3 million and capital loss carryforwards totaling $0.2 million. The operating loss carryforward amount was attributable to U.S. federal and state operating loss carryforwards of $162.7 million and $26.8 million, respectively that will expire from 2017 to 2037; and various other operating loss carryforwards of $10.2 million that will expire from 2018 to 2037. Should 20 ----- there be an IRC Sec. 338(h)(10) election made as a result of the future sale, these net operating losses would not be able to be utilized by the buyer in the future. The credit carryforward amount was attributable to a U.S. federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of $0.7 million with an indefinite life, and U.S. state credit carryforwards of $1.4 million that will expire from 2017 to 2021. The capital loss carryforward is attributable to a U.K. capital loss of $0.2 million with an indefinite life. In general, under Section 382 and 383 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), a U.S. corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (“NOLs”) or tax credits to offset future taxable income. Therefore, current or future changes in our Canadian stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control, could result in a U.S. ownership change under Section 382 and 383 of the Code. If we undergo a U.S. ownership change, our ability to utilize U.S. federal or state NOLs or tax credits could be limited. We monitor changes in our ownership on an ongoing basis and do not believe we had a change in control as of December 31, 2016. We establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of the available evidence, both positive and negative, for each respective tax jurisdiction, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Due to a cumulative loss position, we determined it is more likely than not we will not realize the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets in the U.S.; therefore, we continue to record a full valuation allowance, exclusive of non-reversing deferred tax liabilities, in the U.S. of $66.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Due to uncertainty resulting from the lack of sustained taxable income in recent years in Mexico, we have determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit from net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets in this jurisdiction will not be realized in the future. In recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of $4.7 million to reduce our deferred tax assets in Mexico. In 2006, the FASB issued guidance regarding provisions of uncertain tax positions in ASC 740, which provides specific guidance on the financial statement recognition, measurement, reporting and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits, either permanent or temporary, should be recorded in the financial statements.

Cott amended and refinanced the ABL facility and incurred financing fees in connection therewith, in aggregate of $12.4 million. These fees have been capitalized and deferred and are recorded in Other long-term assets, net and are being amortized using the straight-line method over the duration of the amended ABL facility. On August 3, 2016, Cott amended and restated the ABL facility. As amended and restated, the ABL facility is a fiveyear revolving facility of up to $500 million, which, subject to certain conditions, may be increased by up to an additional $100 million at Cott’s option if agreed upon by the participating lenders. The ABL facility provides the Company and its subsidiaries, Cott Beverages Inc. (“CBI”), Cott Beverages Limited, DSS, Cliffstar LLC and S&D, with financing in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. serves as administrative agent and administrative collateral agent and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch serves as U.K. security trustee. Availability under the ABL facility is dependent on a borrowing base calculated as a percentage of the value of eligible inventory, accounts receivable and property, plant and equipment in the manner set forth in the credit agreement governing the ABL facility. The debt under the ABL facility is guaranteed by most of the Company’s U.S., Canadian, U.K. and Luxembourg subsidiaries and certain of the Company’s Dutch subsidiaries. Cott incurred approximately $3.4 million of financing fees in connection with the ABL facility which are being amortized using the straight-line method over the duration of the ABL facility. The amendment to the ABL facility was considered to be a modification of the original agreement under GAAP. As of December 31, 2016, the total availability under the ABL facility was $432.9 million, which was based on the Company’s borrowing base (accounts receivables, inventory, and fixed assets) as of January 20, 2017 (the December monthend under the terms of the credit agreement governing our ABL facility). We had $207.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the ABL facility and $42.4 million in outstanding letters of credit. As a result, Cott’s availability under the ABL facility was $183.5 million. Calculations were consist with the historical basis used for calculating the total availability under the ABL facility, The commitment fee was 0.375% per annum of the unused commitment of $250.6 million, which was based on Cott’s total ABL facility commitment of $500.0 million, excluding outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit. Each month’s borrowing base is not effective until submitted to the lenders, which usually occurs on the twentieth day of the following month. The weighted average effective interest rate at December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016 on the outstanding LIBOR and Prime loans was 2.3% and 2.2%, respectively. The effective interest rates are based on Cott’s consolidated leverage ratio. _5.375% Senior Notes due in 2022_ In June 2014, we issued $525.0 million of our 5.375% senior notes due 2022 to qualified purchasers in a private placement under Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”). The issuer of the notes is CBI and the obligations of the notes are guaranteed by most of Cott’s U.S., Canadian and U.K. subsidiaries. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on January 1st and July 1st of each year. On May 13, 2015, Cott exchanged the notes for notes that are registered under the Securities Act and do not contain transfer restrictions, registration rights or additional interest provisions, but otherwise contain identical economic terms (the “2022 Notes”). 27 ----- Cott incurred $9.6 million of financing fees in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes. The financing fees are being amortized using the effective interest method over an eight-year period, which represents the term to maturity of the 2022 Notes. _6.750% Senior Notes due in 2020_ In December 2014, we issued the $625.0 million of 6.75% senior notes due January 1, 2020 to qualified purchasers in a private placement under Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. The issuer of the notes is CBI and we and most of Cott’s U.S., Canadian and U.K. subsidiaries guarantee the obligations. The interest on the notes is payable semiannually on January 1st and July 1st of each year. On July 14, 2015, Cott exchanged the notes for notes that are registered under the Securities Act and do not contain transfer restrictions, registration rights or additional interest provisions, but otherwise contain identical economic terms (the “2020 Notes”). Cott incurred $14.4 million of financing fees in connection with the issuance of the 2020 Notes.

The total expense with respect to these plans was $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 (January 2, 2016 - $5.0 million). The Cott Traditional Business also maintains three defined benefit (“DB”) plans acquired as a part of prior acquisitions. One DB plan covers certain employees at one plant in the United States under a collective bargaining agreement and is referred to as the U.S. Plan. Two DB plans covers certain employees of the Cott Traditional Business in the United Kingdom and are referred to collectively as the U.K. Plans. Retirement benefits for employees covered by the U.S. Plans and U.K. Plans are based on years of service multiplied by a monthly benefit factor. Pension costs are funded in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law. All DB plans are closed to new participants and are frozen.

These changes in market conditions may adversely impact our financial performance and are referred to as market risks. When deemed appropriate by management, we use derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of foreign currency market risks. We use various types of derivative instruments including, but not limited to, forward contracts and swap agreements for certain commodities. Forward contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency at a predetermined future date, and at a predetermined rate or price. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. All derivatives are carried at fair value in the combined balance sheets in the line item accounts receivable, net or accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally enforceable agreements with the same counterparties. These allow us to net settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from different transactions with the same counterparty. The accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the types of hedging relationships. Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the same line item in our combined statements of operations as the changes in the fair value of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged. The changes in fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in the combined statements of operations in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged, fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments are immediately recognized into earnings. We classify cash inflows and outflows related to derivative and hedging instruments with the appropriate cash flows section associated with the item being hedged. For derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, we formally designate and document, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, we formally assess both at the inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures. Any ineffective portion of a financial instrument’s change in fair value is immediately recognized into earnings. We estimate the fair values of our derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates (see Note 17 to the combined carve-out financial statements). The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial risks described above. The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates or other financial indices. We do not view the fair values of our derivatives in isolation, but rather in relation to the fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged transactions. All of our derivatives are over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets. 35 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Foreign exchange contracts typically have maturities of less than twelve months. All outstanding hedges as of December 31, 2016 are expected to settle in the next twelve months. We maintain a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that our procurement activities will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into forward contracts to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and qualified for our foreign currency cash flow hedging program were $15.3 million and $4.5 million as of December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016 respectively. Approximately $0.1 million and $0.4 million of unrealized net of tax gains related to the foreign currency cash flow hedges were included in AOCI as of December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, respectively. The hedge ineffectiveness for these cash flow hedging instruments during 2016 and 2015 was not material. We entered into commodity swaps on aluminum to mitigate the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of materials used in our manufacturing process. These derivative instruments have been designated and qualified as a part of our commodity cash flow hedging program. The objective of this hedging program is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with future purchases of aluminum. We had no outstanding aluminum commodity swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2016. The total notional value of derivatives that were designated and qualified for our commodity cash flow hedging program were $49.3 million as of January 2, 2016. Unrealized net of tax losses of $5.3 million related to the commodity swaps were included in AOCI as of January 2, 2016. The cumulative hedge ineffectiveness was not material for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. The fair value of our derivative assets included within other receivables as a component of accounts receivable, net was $0.1 million and $0.6 million as of December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, respectively. The fair value of our derivative liabilities included in accrued liabilities was $8.0 million as at January 2, 2016. The settlement of our cash flow hedges resulted in a decrease to cost of sales of $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to an increase to cost of sales of $1.5 million for the year ended January 2, 2016.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623

Additionally, the inputs used to measure fair value are prioritized based on a three-level hierarchy. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows: � Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. � Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. � Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. 36 ----- We have certain assets and liabilities such as our derivative instruments that are required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our derivative assets and liabilities represent Level 2 instruments. Level 2 instruments are valued based on observable inputs for quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets. The fair value of the derivative assets as of December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016 was $0.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The fair value of the derivative liabilities as at January 2, 2016 was $8.0 million.",N/A,as_expected,2018,623
