Under no circumstances shall the Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer

The materials relating to the Offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or

Offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and any of the Initial Purchasers of the securities offered under

of the Initial Purchasers, any person who controls any Initial Purchaser, the Issuer, the Guarantors (each as defined
in the Offering Memorandum) or any of their respective directors, managers, officers, employees, agents or
affiliates, accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any difference between the Offering

Memorandum distributed to you in electronic form and any version that will be provided to you at a later date
upon your request from any Initial Purchaser.

Any distributor subject to MiFID II (for the purposes of this paragraph, a "distributor") subsequently offering,
selling or recommending the Notes is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of
the Notes and determining the appropriate distribution channels for the purposes of the MiFID II product
governance rules under Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593 ("Delegated Directive"). Neither the
Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representations or warranties as to a distributor's compliance
with the Delegated Directive.

**MiFID II Product Governance/Professional investors and ECPs (as defined below) only target market:**
Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of each manufacturer's target market assessment in respect
of the securities described in the attached Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target
market for such securities is eligible counterparties ("ECPs") and professional clients only, each as defined in
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, "MiFID II"); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to ECPs
and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such
securities (for the purposes of this paragraph, a "distributor") should take into consideration the manufacturer's
target market assessment; however, and without prejudice to the Issuer's obligations in accordance with MiFID
II, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of
such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer's target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition** **of** **sales** **to** **EEA** **(as** **defined** **in** **the** **Offering** **Memorandum)** **retail** **investors: The securities**
described in the Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and
should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would
not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified
investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the "PRIIPs Regulation") for offering or selling the securities or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling
the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the
PRIIPs Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities in any Member State
of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to
publish a prospectus for offers of the securities. The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes
of the Prospectus Regulation.

**UK** **MiFIR** **product** **governance/Professional** **investors** **and** **ECPs** **only** **target** **market: Solely for the purposes**
of each manufacturer's product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to
the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA
Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional clients, as defined in UK MiFIR; and (ii) all
channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a "distributor") should take into consideration
the manufacturer's target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product
Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment
in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer's target market assessment) and
determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition** **of** **sales** **to** **UK** **retail** **investors: The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made**
available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United
Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined
in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA;
(ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the
FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of UK MiFIR; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2
of the UK Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No
1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the "UK PRIIPs Regulation") for offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared


-----

and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United
Kingdom may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the United Kingdom
will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation and the FSMA from the requirement
to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the
UK Prospectus Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum is being distributed for information purposes only and is subject to completion and
amendment (which may be material) without notice. The definitive terms of the transaction will be described in
the final version of the Offering Memorandum. The Offering Memorandum shall not, and is not intended to,
constitute or contain any offer or invitation to sell or the solicitation of any offer to buy and may not be used as,
or in connection with, any offer or invitation to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy any of the securities
described therein.

**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **IN THE UNITED STATES**

#### Ephios Subco 3 S.à r.l.

_to acquire_

###### SYNLAB AG


###### €550,000,000      % Senior Secured Notes due 2031

Ephios Subco 3 S.à r.l., a private limited liability company (société à responsabilité limitée) incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg
(the "Issuer"), an indirect subsidiary of Ephios Luxembourg S.à r.l., a private limited liability company (société à responsabilité limitée)
incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg (the "Bidder"), is offering (the "Offering") €550.0 million aggregate principal amount of
its       % Senior Secured Notes due 2031 (the "Notes") as part of the financing for the acquisition by the Bidder (the "Acquisition")
of up to 100% of the outstanding shares of SYNLAB AG, a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) organized under the laws of Germany
(the "Target").

The Notes will mature on January 31, 2031. The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually in arrear on each
of            and          , commencing on          , 2024. At any time on or after          , 2026, the Issuer may
redeem all or part of the Notes at the redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum (the "Offering Memorandum"). Prior
to          , 2026, the Issuer may redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the redemption date and a "make whole" premium, as
described in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, prior to          , 2026, the Issuer may also redeem, at its option, up to 40%
of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth
in this Offering Memorandum if at least 50% of the originally issued aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding. Prior
to          , 2026, the Issuer may also redeem, during each twelve-month period commencing with the Issue Date, up to 10% of the
original principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional Notes), at its option, at a redemption
price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to,
but excluding, the redemption date.

The Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law at a price
equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date. In addition, in connection with any tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party
making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer
or such third party will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at
a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of such Notes (excluding any early tender or incentive fee). Upon the occurrence
of certain specified change of control events, the Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase the applicable Notes at 101% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if,
_pro forma for such change of control, a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event._

Pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will, concurrently with the issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date (as defined
herein), deposit or arrange to have deposited the gross proceeds from the Offering into an escrow account (the ''Escrow Account'') in
the name of the Issuer. The Escrow Account will be controlled by the Escrow Agent (as defined herein) and charged on a first-priority
basis in favor of the Trustee (as defined herein) on behalf and for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. The release of the escrowed
proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the closing of the Acquisition. The closing of the Acquisition
is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory approval. If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to September 29, 2024
(the "Escrow Longstop Date"), or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory
redemption. The special mandatory redemption price of the Notes will be equal to 100% of the issue price of such Notes, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date, or if applicable, from the most recent date on which interest with
respect to such Notes was paid or provided for, to, but not including, such special mandatory redemption date. See "Description of the
_Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.''_

The Notes will be the general senior obligations of the Issuer, will rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future
indebtedness or obligations of the Issuer that are not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes (including the obligations
of the Issuer under the New Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein) and the New Term Loan B (as defined herein)) and will rank
senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes. The Notes will be effectively senior to all of the existing and future Indebtedness or obligations of the Issuer that
are not secured by the Collateral (as defined herein), to the extent of the value of such Collateral, and will be effectively subordinated to
any existing and future Indebtedness or obligations of the Issuer that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the
extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness or obligations. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to
all of the existing and future Indebtedness or obligations of the subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not provide Guarantees. Following the
Acquisition, the Notes will be structurally subordinated, but effectively senior, to the Target Group's borrowings that remain outstanding
under the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B, if any, to the extent of the value of the Collateral.

Upon the initial issuance of the Notes, the Notes will not benefit from any guarantees, but will be secured by a first-priority security
interest over the proceeds of the Offering deposited in the Escrow Account. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined herein),
within 180 days following the Control Date (as defined herein), and substantially simultaneously with the guarantees granted in favor
of the obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the New Term Loan B, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Target and
the other Guarantors (as defined herein) (such guarantees collectively, the ''Note Guarantees''). On or about the Completion Date,
bj h A d S i P i i l h N ill b d fi ki b i b h C l i D C ll l ( d fi d

before the Completion Date, the Notes will also be secured from a date promptly after the Completion Date until the date on which until
the Squeeze-Out Threshold is met, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, on a first-ranking basis by the Pre-Squeeze-Out Collateral
(as defined herein). In addition, within 180 days following (and excluding) the Control Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles,
the Notes and the Note Guarantees (as applicable), will be secured on a first-ranking basis by the Post-Completion Collateral (as defined
herein). The Collateral that will secure the Notes will also secure the New Revolving Credit Facility and the New Term Loan B. The
validity and enforceability of the security interests will be subject to the limitations described in "Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations." The Collateral and the_
Note Guarantees may be released in certain circumstances.

There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the
"Authority") for the listing of, and permission to deal in, the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the
"Exchange") in Guernsey, the Channel Islands. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the
Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained. Settlement of the Notes is
not conditional on such listing or admission.

**Investing in the Notes involves risks. See "Risk Factors" beginning on page 32.**

**Issue price of the Notes:      %.**

**The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended**
**(the "Securities Act"), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes are being offered and sold inside**
**the United States only to qualified institutional buyers ("QIBs") in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act ("Rule**
**144A") and outside the United States in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act**
**("Regulation S"). Prospective purchasers that are QIBs are hereby notified that the Initial Purchasers may be relying on the**
**exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. For a description of certain restrictions**
**on transfers of the Notes, see "Plan of Distribution" and "Notice to Investors."**

The Notes will be issued in registered form in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

**IMPORTANT INFORMATION**

The Issuer is offering the Notes, and the Guarantors are issuing the Note Guarantees, in reliance on exemptions
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. These exemptions apply to offers and sales of securities
that do not involve a public offering. The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been registered with,
recommended by or approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or any other
securities commission or regulatory authority, nor has the SEC or any such securities commission or authority
passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this Offering Memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a
criminal offense in the United States.

This Offering Memorandum is confidential and has been prepared by us solely for use in connection with the
Offering. This Offering Memorandum is personal to each offeree and does not constitute an offer to any other
person or to the public generally to subscribe for or otherwise acquire the Notes. Distribution of this Offering
Memorandum to any person other than the prospective investor and any person retained to advise such prospective
investor with respect to the purchase of Notes is unauthorized, and any disclosure of any of the contents of this
Offering Memorandum, without our prior written consent, is prohibited. Each prospective investor, by accepting
delivery of this Offering Memorandum, agrees to the foregoing and to make no photocopies of this Offering
Memorandum or any documents referred to in this Offering Memorandum.

In making an investment decision regarding the Notes, prospective investors must rely on their own examination
of our business and the terms of the Offering, including the merits and risks involved. In connection with the
Offering, the Initial Purchasers are not acting for anyone other than the Issuer and will not be responsible to anyone
other than the Issuer for providing the protections (regulatory or otherwise) afforded to their clients nor for
providing advice in relation to the Offering. In addition, none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or any of their
respective representatives are making any representation to you regarding the legality of an investment in the
Notes, and you should not construe anything in this Offering Memorandum as legal, business or tax advice. You
should consult your own advisors as to legal, tax, business, financial and related aspects of an investment in the
Notes. You must comply with all laws applicable in any jurisdiction in which you buy, offer or sell the Notes or
possess or distribute this Offering Memorandum, and you must obtain all applicable consents and approvals;
neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers shall have any responsibility for any of the foregoing legal
requirements.

Subject as set out below, the Issuer accepts responsibility for the information contained in this Offering
Memorandum and, to the best of the Issuer's knowledge (having taken reasonable care to ensure that such is the
case), the information contained in this Offering Memorandum is in accordance with the facts and does not omit
anything likely to affect the import of such information.

The Initial Purchasers make no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness
of the information contained in this Offering Memorandum. Nothing contained in this Offering Memorandum is,
or shall be relied upon as, a promise or representation by the Initial Purchasers as to the past or future.

To the extent not otherwise indicated, the information contained in this Offering Memorandum on the markets in
which we operate and market and industry developments and trends, including growth rates, are based on our
assessments and estimates, using underlying data from independent third parties. We have obtained market data
and certain industry forecasts used in this Offering Memorandum from internal surveys, reports and studies, where
appropriate, as well as market research, publicly available information and industry publications or commissioned
reports.

Where information has been sourced from third parties, it has been accurately reproduced, citing the relevant
source. As far as we are aware and are able to ascertain from information published by such third parties, no facts
have been omitted that would make the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading.

Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have independently verified the figures, market data or other information on
which third parties have based their studies. Accordingly, we and the Initial Purchasers make no representation or
warranty as to the accuracy, completeness or verification of any such information from third party studies included
in this Offering Memorandum (for the avoidance of doubt, this does not apply to our own company data analysis
described below). You should note that our own estimates and statements of opinion and belief are not always
based on studies of third parties.

In addition, certain statistics, data and other information relating to markets, market sizes, market shares, market
positions and other industry data pertaining to our business and markets in this Offering Memorandum are not

Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. National Center
for Biotechnology Information and services commissioned from Boston Consulting Group (together, the
"Company Data Analysis").

In addition, this Offering Memorandum contains summaries believed to be accurate with respect to certain
documents, but reference is made to the actual documents for complete information. All such summaries are
qualified in their entirety by such reference. However, this information has been accurately reproduced and as far
as the Issuer is aware and is able to ascertain from information published by that third party, no facts have been
omitted which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading.

relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial
Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the "Financial Promotion Order"), (ii) are persons falling within
Article 49(2)(a) to (d) ("high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.") of the Financial Promotion
Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in

amended, the "FSMA")) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be
communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as "relevant persons").
This Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons
who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum relates
is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in the United Kingdom will
be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of UK domestic law (as
amended, the "UK Prospectus Regulation") by virtue of EUWA and the FSMA from the requirement to publish
a prospectus for offers of Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK
Prospectus Regulation.

unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

**_UK MIFIR Product Governance / Professional Investors and Eligible Counterparties Only Target Market_**

defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional clients, as defined in UK
MiFIR; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (for the purposes of this
paragraph, a "distributor") should take into consideration the manufacturers' target market assessment; however,
a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining
the manufacturers' target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Offering Memorandum contains forward-looking statements, including statements about our markets and
our strategy, future operations, industry forecasts, expected investments and target levels of leverage and
indebtedness. Forward-looking statements provide our current expectations, intentions or forecasts of future
events. Forward-looking statements include statements about expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions,
assumptions and other statements that are not statements of historical fact. Words or phrases such as "anticipate,"
"believe," "continue," "ongoing," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "plan," "potential," "predict," "project,"
"target," "seek," "should," "could," or similar words or phrases, or the negatives of those words or phrases, may
identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is
not forward looking.

Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on
potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or
implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in our
forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in the section entitled "Risk Factors"
in this Offering Memorandum. For example, factors that could cause our actual results to vary from projected
future results include, but are not limited to:

  - regulatory conditions in the markets in which we operate and our ability to comply and respond
effectively to regulatory reforms;

  - decreases in government-controlled tariffs for clinical laboratory services;

  - efforts by third-party payers and health insurance companies to control healthcare spending and
reimbursement levels;

  - weak economic conditions including economic downturns;

  - the impact of high inflation on material, personnel and operating expenses;

  - increased quality and price competition;

  - our ability to execute acquisitions and effectively integrate acquired businesses into our network;

  - the achievability of our cost savings objectives;

  - failure to manage or integrate acquisitions or achieve anticipated synergies;

  - failure to realize the full value of goodwill recorded;

  - negative market perceptions, particularly with respect to the safety, effectiveness and quality of our
testing;

  - our dependence on large customer contracts;

  - our ability to retain or recruit experienced laboratory doctors;

  - our dependence on senior management, experienced laboratory professionals and key personnel;

  - our compliance with appropriate quality standards for our testing services;

  - business interruptions at our laboratory facilities and related reputational damage;

  - difficulties in collecting on customer debts;

  - disruption to our collection and transportation networks;

  - adverse results in material litigation;

  - the impact of extreme weather conditions on our activity levels;


-----

  - disruptions or higher costs due to labor disputes;

  - uninsured liabilities we may incur;

  - our exposure to cybersecurity risks;

  - failure to license new test or technology;

  - failure of our information technology systems;

  - failure to protect our trademarks in the countries in which we operate;

  - our compliance with or obligations under privacy, environmental, health and safety laws;

  - challenges to the organization and legal structure of our French operations and our dependence on
laboratory doctors to check operations carried out by SELs (as defined herein);

  - failure of our internal controls, procedures, compliance systems and risk management systems;

  - failure to comply with tax legislation, including VAT and French payroll tax;

  - other risks related to our capital structure and the Notes; and

  - certain other risks set forth under the heading "Risk Factors."

Accordingly, prospective investors should not rely on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of
the date of this Offering Memorandum or as otherwise indicated. We do not have any obligation to publicly revise
any forward-looking statement to reflect circumstances or events after the date of such forward-looking statement
or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

In addition, from time to time we and our representatives, acting in respect of information provided by us, have
made or may make forward-looking statements orally or in writing. These forward-looking statements may be
included in, but are not limited to, press releases (including on our website), reports to our security holders and
other communications. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements
are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. We undertake no
obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise.

The risks described in the "Risk Factors" section of this Offering Memorandum are not exhaustive. Other sections
of this Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment.
New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks; nor can we assess the
impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause
actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and
uncertainties, prospective investors should not place undue reliance on forward- looking statements as a prediction
of actual results.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Presentation of Financial Information**

**_General_**

The Issuer is a newly incorporated holding company formed under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg
on August 24, 2023 to facilitate the Acquisition and it is not expected to engage in any activities other than those
related to its formation, the Acquisition and the financing of the Acquisition. Following the Acquisition, the Issuer
will be the indirect parent of the Target. The Issuer has not engaged in any activities other than those related to its
formation and the Transactions and does not expect to have any business operations, material assets or liabilities
other than its interest in the issued and outstanding shares of its subsidiaries and outstanding indebtedness and
intercompany balances incurred in connection with the Transactions. We do not present in this Offering
Memorandum any financial information or financial statements of the Issuer, other than certain limited financial
data presented at the Issuer level on a combined basis as adjusted to reflect the Transactions. See "Summary—
_Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data" and "Capitalization."_

Since the Issuer does not have any material assets or liabilities, other than its interest in the issued and outstanding
shares of its subsidiaries and its obligations relating to the Transactions, there are no material differences between
the financial condition of the Issuer, on the one hand, and the Target Group, on the other hand. The non-disclosure
of the Issuer's accounts would not be likely to mislead investors with regard to facts and circumstances that are
essential for assessing the Notes.

Unless otherwise noted, all historical financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is that of the
Target and its consolidated subsidiaries. Accordingly, unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires,
all references to "we," "us," our," or the "Target Group" in respect of historical consolidated financial information
in this Offering Memorandum are to the Target and its consolidated subsidiaries.

**_Financial Statements_**

This Offering Memorandum contains (i) SYNLAB AG's audited consolidated financial statements and the notes
thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the "2022 Financial Statements"); (ii) SYNLAB AG's
audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021
(including the comparative figures for the year ended December 31, 2020, the "2021 Financial Statements" and,
together with the 2022 Financial Statements, the "Audited Financial Statements"); and (iii) SYNLAB AG's
unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30,
2023, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union
("IFRS") on Interim Financial Reporting (IAS 34) (the "Interim Financial Statements" and, together with the
Audited Financial Statements, the "Financial Statements"). The Audited Financial Statements have been
prepared in accordance with IFRS and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to
Section 315e paragraph 1 of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, "HGB"). The Audited Financial
Statements were audited by Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Rosenheimer Platz 4, 81669
Munich, Germany, a member of the German Chamber of Public Accountants (Wirtschaftsprüferkammer), as the
statutory auditors of SYNLAB AG. Copies of their audit reports and the Financial Statements are included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

The consolidated financial information included in this Offering Memorandum has been derived as follows:

   - the consolidated financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 has been
derived from the 2022 Financial Statements;

   - the consolidated financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 has been
derived from the comparative figures for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in the 2022
Financial Statements;

   - the consolidated financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 has been
derived from the comparative figures for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in the 2021
Financial Statements; and


-----

   - the consolidated financial information as of September 30, 2023 and for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 has been derived from the Interim Financial
Statements.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting
estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying its accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are
significant, are disclosed in the Financial Statements. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates."_

In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of the Offering and the
financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Changes to Accounting Presentation_**

In the consolidated statement of financial position included in the 2021 Financial Statements, financial non-current
assets are presented as part of "other non-current assets" and financial current assets are presented as part of the
"other current assets." In the 2022 Financial Statements, the presentation was changed as "financial non-current
assets" and "financial current assets" are presented as separate line items in the consolidated statement of financial
position. Accordingly, the presentation of the comparative figures for the year ended December 31, 2021 included
in the 2022 Financial Statements was adjusted.

**Other Financial Measures**

**_Non-IFRS Measures_**

Throughout this Offering Memorandum, we present financial measures and adjustments that are not presented in
accordance with IFRS, or any other internationally accepted accounting principles. Certain of these measures are
termed "Non-IFRS" measures because they exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts that are
excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, or are
calculated using financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with IFRS. These Non-IFRS measures
include base revenue, COVID-19 related revenue, Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma RunRate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Cash Conversion, Net Capex, net financial debt, Unlevered
Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow and organic growth (collectively, the "Non-IFRS Measures").

  - "Base revenue" is our total revenue for a period minus COVID-19-related revenue for that period.

  - "COVID-19-related revenue" represents our revenue attributable to the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic, including earnings from SARS-CoV-2 testing and related services, and also includes the
temporary decline in our standard routine and specialty diagnostic testing activity that occurred in the
early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

  - "Adjusted Operating Profit" represents net profit for the period, less profit for the period from
discontinued operations, before net finance costs, income tax expenses, amortization of customer
relationships, restructuring and other significant expenses (mainly expenses for strategic projects),
acquisition- and disposal-related (income)/expenses, impairment of non-current assets, customer
relationship amortization and share-based payments.

  - "Adjusted EBITDA" represents net profit for the period, less profit for the period from discontinued
operations, before net finance costs, income tax expenses, restructuring and other significant expenses
(mainly expenses for strategic projects), acquisition- and disposal-related (income)/expenses,
impairment of non-current assets, share-based payments and depreciation and amortization (amortization
of customer relationships and operating depreciation and amortization).

  - "Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA" represents net profit for the period, less profit for the period
from discontinued operations, before net finance costs, income tax expenses, restructuring and other
significant expenses (mainly expenses for strategic projects), acquisition- and disposal-related
(income)/expenses, impairment of non-current assets, share-based payments, depreciation and
amortization (amortization of customer relationships and operating depreciation and amortization),
covenant adjustments (including extraordinary items, share-based payments, start-up losses, the _pro_
_forma impact of in-year acquisitions and disposals and M&A synergies), management adjustments_


-----

(including M&A and restructuring-related severance, certain provisions, subsidies, write-offs and
adjustments and one-off prior year expenses in each of our segments), pro forma adjustments (including
public company costs, the full-year impact of acquisitions completed in the year and the impacts of the
sales of our veterinary business and our businesses in Switzerland, Poland and Ukraine), illustrative runrate adjustments (including SALIX run-rate savings, anticipated productivity improvements in 2024 and
run-rate margin adjustments for our Synnovis contract) and the removal of excess COVID-19 EBITDA.

  - "Adjusted EBITDA Margin" is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the applicable
period.

  - "Cash Conversion" is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less Net Capex, divided by Adjusted EBITDA.

  - "Net Capex" is defined as cash outflow for the purchase of intangibles and property, plant and
equipment, net of proceeds from the sale of intangibles and property, plant and equipment.

  - "Net financial debt" is external interest-bearing loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.

  - "Unlevered Free Cash Flow" is cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations, adjusted
for purchase of intangibles and property, plant and equipment, net of proceeds from sale of intangibles
and property, plant and equipment and lease repayments, less interest expenses on leases.

  - "Free Cash Flow" is cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations, adjusted for purchase
of intangibles and property, plant and equipment, net of proceeds from sale of intangibles and property,
plant and equipment, and lease repayments, further adjusted for interest paid, less interest received, less
interest expenses on leases.

  - "Organic growth" between one accounting period ("period n") and the prior comparative accounting
period ("period n-1") is determined as follows:

      - organic growth for acquisitions that took place during period n-1 is calculated by comparing
(x) revenue in period n with (y) revenue in period n-1 adjusted for the effects of acquisitions
(i.e., by adding back revenue from the acquisitions made during period n-1 prior to the date on
which the relevant operations were added to the scope of consolidation). The full-year
contribution from the acquisitions made during period n-1 consists of the estimate of revenue
recognized by the newly acquired companies prior to the date on which they were added to the
perimeter of consolidation;

      - organic growth for acquisitions that took place during period n is calculated by subtracting
revenue generated by the businesses acquired between the date on which they joined the
perimeter of consolidation and the end of period n;

      - organic growth for disposals that took place during period n is calculated by subtracting revenue
generated by the businesses disposed of between the start of period n-1 and the date on which
they exited the perimeter of consolidation; and

      - the percentage of organic growth is then calculated as the ratio of (x) revenue in period n restated
for the acquisitions completed during period n divided by (y) revenue in period n-1 adjusted for
the impact of the acquisitions completed during period n-1.

We present these Non-IFRS Measures as they (i) are used by management to measure operating performance,
including profitability and liquidity, in presentations to our board members, and as a basis for strategic planning
and forecasting, and (ii) represent similar measures that are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts
and other parties as supplemental measures of performance. These measures enhance management's and investors'
understanding of our financial performance, for example, by excluding items that are outside of ongoing
operations such as income taxes, costs of capital and non-cash expenses.

  - As the impact of the COVID-19-pandemic on our revenue has largely subsided and normalized, we
present our total revenue apportioned between base revenue and COVID-19-related revenue to allow
investors to better evaluate our core underlying business.


-----

  - We believe that Adjusted Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are widely used by investors to
measure our operating performance. Adjusted Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA can vary
substantially from company to company depending on the accounting methods, book value of assets and
capital structure or method by which assets were acquired. Adjusted Operating Profit and Adjusted
EBITDA both eliminate potential differences in performance caused by variations in capital structures
(affecting net finance costs) and tax positions (such as the availability of net operating losses against
which to relieve taxable profits), while Adjusted EBITDA also eliminates potential differences in
performance caused by the cost and age of tangible assets (affecting relative depreciation expense) and
the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable (affecting relative amortization expense). Adjusted
Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA also eliminate the effect of additional specific items that are
considered to hinder comparison of the trading performance of our businesses either year-on-year or with
other businesses.

  - Our _Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA is a quality of earnings metric provided as a tool for_
investors to assess the sustainability of our historical earnings and the achievability of future results as
this metric adds back to Adjusted EBITDA certain adjustments that are permitted under our financing
agreements for the purposes of covenant calculations; makes adjustments for additional one-off, nonrecurring or out-of-period adjustments; makes adjustments for expected acquisitions and disposals that
have not yet been completed and includes an adjustment to remove certain public company costs that
will no longer be incurred under private ownership; includes adjustments to illustrate the full-year impact
on our cost base of either past, ongoing or future productivity or margin enhancements; and eliminates
COVID-19-related EBITDA that is in excess of the expected normalized amount of COVID-19-related
EBITDA going forward.

  - We use Adjusted EBITDA for the purposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA Margin. We present our
Adjusted EBITDA Margin as a measure of our profitability from operations. The nearest measure under
IFRS is profit margin, which is defined as profit for the period divided by revenue.

  - We present Cash Conversion as a measure of our liquidity.

  - We believe that Net Capex is useful to assist investors to understand our spending on IT, equipment and
infrastructure and our commercial spending separately from our acquisition capital expenditure, which
is primarily related to customer lists and associated goodwill from the acquisitions of laboratories.

  - Our net financial debt provides an indication of the overall strength of our balance sheet and can be used
to assess the impact of our cash position as compared to our indebtedness.

  - We present Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow because we believe these measures are useful
to investors to understand the funds that we have available both before and after we have met our financial
obligations.

  - We present organic growth because it is an important element of our strategy that management measures
and investors use to evaluate how testing volumes and pricing impact our revenue from one period to the
next separately from the impact of the revenue contributions of businesses that we acquire during the
relevant periods.

However, these Non-IFRS Measures are not measures or adjustments determined based on IFRS or any other
internationally accepted accounting principles, and you should not consider such items as an alternative to the
historical financial results or other indicators of our performance based on IFRS measures. The Non-IFRS
Measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as presented by other companies
due to differences in the way our Non-IFRS Measures are calculated. Even though the Non-IFRS Measures are
used by management to assess ongoing operating performance and liquidity and these types of measures are
commonly used by investors, they have important limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider
them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. For example, some of the
limitations for the Non-IFRS Measures include the following:

  - they exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us;

  - they do not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and
amortized that may have to be replaced in the future;


-----

  - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

  - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest
payments on our debts; and

  - the further adjustments made in calculating Adjusted Operating Profit are those that management
consider are not representative of our underlying operations and therefore are, by definition, subjective
in nature.

For a reconciliation of the Non-IFRS Measures to the Financial Statements, see "Summary Historical
_Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data."_

**_LTM Period Financial Information_**

The unaudited consolidated income statement information and the other financial information presented for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2023 (the "LTM Period") have been derived by subtracting the consolidated
financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 included as comparative financial
information in the Interim Financial Statements or derived from SYNLAB AG's internal accounting system from
the consolidated financial information for the year ended December 31, 2022 derived from the 2022 Financial
Statements or derived from SYNLAB AG's internal accounting system and adding the consolidated financial
information for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 derived from the Interim Financial Statements or
derived from SYNLAB AG's internal accounting system. The unaudited consolidated income statement
information and the other financial information presented for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 have
been prepared for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily representative of SYNLAB AG's results of
operations for any future period or SYNLAB AG's financial condition at any future date. This data has been
prepared solely for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum and has not been audited, reviewed or otherwise
been verified by any external auditors. We believe financial information for the LTM Period is useful to investors
to gauge the recent trend of our performance.

**Non-Financial Operating Data**

Certain non-financial operating data included in this Offering Memorandum are derived from management
estimates, are not part of the Financial Statements or financial accounting records, and have not been audited by
auditors or other outside consultants or experts. Our use or computation of these terms may not be comparable to
the use or computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Any or all these terms should
not be considered in isolation or as an alternative measure of performance under IFRS.

**Financial Year**

Our financial year begins on January 1 of a given calendar year and ends on December 31 of that calendar year.

**Rounding and Presentation Conventions**

Certain financial information (including percentages) presented in this Offering Memorandum has been rounded
according to established commercial standards. As a result, figures shown as totals in this Offering Memorandum
may not be exact arithmetic aggregations of the figures that precede them. Percentages and amounts reflecting
changes over time periods relating to financial data are calculated using the numerical data in the Financial
Statements included in this Offering Memorandum, as applicable, and do not use the numerical data in the
narrative description thereof.

Unless indicated otherwise, all financial information presented in the text and tables in this Offering Memorandum
is shown in millions of euros (€ millions).

Financial information presented in parentheses denotes the negative of such number presented. A dash ("–")
signifies that the relevant item is not available or applicable, while a zero signifies that the relevant figure is
available but has been rounded to zero.

**SUMMARY**

_This summary highlights information from this Offering Memorandum. It is not complete and does not_
_contain all the information that you should consider before investing in the Notes. You should read this_
_Offering Memorandum carefully in its entirety, including the sections entitled "Risk Factors,"_
_"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Industry"_
_and "Business," as well as the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

**Our Business**

We are the leader in medical diagnostic services and specialty testing in Europe. We offer a full range of
innovative and reliable medical diagnostics to patients, practicing doctors, hospitals and clinics,
governments and corporates. Providing the leading level of service within the industry, we are the partner
of choice for routine and specialty diagnostics in human medicine. We continuously innovate medical
diagnostic services for the benefit of patients and customers. We are present in 33 countries across five
continents and hold leading positions in most markets, regularly reinforcing the strength of our network
through a proven acquisition and portfolio optimization strategy, while remaining focused on diligent cost
control through initiatives such as our "SALIX" (Scale, Alignment, Leverage, Instruction, X-check)
operational excellence program. More than 27,000 employees, including over 2,000 medical experts,
contribute every day to our worldwide success as we perform around 600 million laboratory tests per year.

Our business is well-positioned to take advantage of the growing market for clinical laboratory and medical
diagnostic services in Europe, which benefits from favorable structural trends, including an aging
population, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, a growing focus on disease prevention, increasing
outsourcing of clinical laboratory testing by hospitals and an additional need for advanced testing.

We have been a pioneer in the consolidation trend in the European clinical laboratories market. Our
expansion strategy is focused on adapting to local market environments while drawing from the strength of
our pan-European support functions. Our market position and the scale of our laboratory network also allow
us to benefit from favorable procurement conditions with suppliers, including through group-wide panEuropean framework supply agreements for reagents and equipment. Major parts of the European clinical
laboratory and medical diagnostic services market remain fragmented, providing further meaningful
opportunities for continued expansion.

Our SALIX program consists of efficiency-enhancing and cost-savings initiatives relating to laboratory
centralization; group-wide logistics management; and the optimization of staffing of laboratories and blood
collection points. The SALIX program addresses all three of our primary cost groups (i.e., materials,
personnel and other operating expenses). Having been implemented in 2017, with the first savings achieved
in 2018, SALIX has generated approximately €140 million in total savings, including approximately
€25 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 and approximately €30 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, with further ongoing savings expected over the medium term.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded revenue of €2,691.1 million, with net profit
(group share) amounting to €130.0 million. Our _Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA was_
€455.6 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, amounting to 17.6% of our revenue for
the period. For a reconciliation of net profit to Adjusted Operating Profit and Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted
EBITDA, see "—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data."


-----

We have a pan-European presence and hold a top three or top five market position by revenue within most
of the markets where we operate. We provide clinical laboratory and medical diagnostic services through a
network of more than 450 laboratories and more than 1,800 blood collection points across 33 countries,
with core markets in France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. We also provide clinical laboratory
testing services in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. Our global footprint and our leading market

geographies, testing services and test parameters. We benefit from a broad and diverse customer and payer
base that includes tens of thousands of medical practices, hundreds of hospitals and millions of individuals,
in addition to medical insurance companies, governmental bodies, pharmaceutical companies and other
corporate employers.

Revenue is generated across three channels: (i) business-to-business ("B2B") (which has historically
provided approximately 60% of our annual revenue), through hospital laboratory outsourcing, services to
physicians and through lab-to-lab services; (ii) business-to-consumer ("B2C") through retail/blood
collection points; and (iii) direct-to-consumer ("D2C") through prevention services and wellness tests (with
the B2C and D2C channels together providing the remaining approximately 40% of our historic annual
revenue).

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_We operate in the large, resilient and growing clinical laboratory services market, which has advantages_**
**_for established market participants and is supported by strong non-cyclical growth trends that have been_**
**_accelerated by COVID-19-pandemic tailwinds._**

Our core markets have grown materially throughout the last decade and have proven resilient to economic
cycles. The market is also expected to continue to benefit from favorable demographic factors, such as an
aging population, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases as well as an increasing propensity of public
healthcare providers to outsource diagnostic services to private sector companies, a shortage of experts and
personnel specifically in molecular biology, genetics and pathology, a growing focus on disease prevention,
increasing outsourcing of clinical laboratory testing by hospitals, a growing market for D2C services,
precision medicine and digital, artificial intelligence ("AI") and data services, the monetization of
healthcare data and an increasing demand for fast servicing in specialized diagnostics. These are expected
to be key growth drivers for the future.

Medical diagnostics services are an essential part of the medical value chain, with approximately 70% of
medical decisions based on laboratory results. The medical diagnostic testing market we address today is
large, resilient and is expected to grow from a market value of approximately €28 billion in 2023 to
approximately €34 billion by 2028, growing at an approximately 3–4% compound annual growth rate
("CAGR").

The medical diagnostics market in our core European countries (France, Germany, Italy and the United
Kingdom) is expected to grow at approximately a 2% CAGR from 2023 to 2028. Our established leadership
position and reputation as a high quality provider in the medical diagnostics market affords us certain
advantages that put us in prime position to grow with the market, which include: (i) economies of scale:
significant benefits derived from experience in longer test series infrastructure (lower fixed cost per test)
due to scale benefits in overhead and logistics; (ii) increasing regulation: established players are better
equipped to deal with strict quality certification regimes, accreditation and guarantor requirements that
create financial hurdles that are burdensome for smaller, or independent operators; (iii) know-how: large
players are best positioned to acquire and retain skilled medical staff and specialists; (iv) reputation: the
build-up of reputation as a reliable, high-quality service provider is time-consuming for new entrants (e.g.,
building up a referral network) resulting in a competitive advantage for established players; and (v) the
_contractual nature of the B2B market: with excellence built into our services and strong relationships with_
physicians in the B2B market and NHS contracts, such as our Synnovis partnership agreement with Guy's
and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in South East
London, we are well entrenched as incumbents with a strong knowledge of the hospital or provider
situation.

In addition to resilient market fundamentals, COVID-19 provided a strong tailwind to the diagnostic testing
market during the pandemic and a testament to the counter-cyclical nature of the industry. While COVID19-related testing levels have now subsided and normalized, the industry is now benefitting from an
increased focus on awareness and disease prevention. This is driving innovation on the provider side and
is increasing access to diagnostic services across the globe, which is expected to continue to sustain volume
growth in the long term. In addition, the temporary revenue increases resulting from SARS-CoV-2 testing
and COVID-19-related services have allowed us to invest in our underlying business and ensure that our
core services are well-funded going forward.

Finally, the medical diagnostic services markets we serve are highly competitive and remain largely
fragmented, providing significant opportunities for larger players like us to continue to consolidate the
industry, entering new markets and reinforcing presence in existing markets. We believe that consolidation
of the clinical laboratory testing market will allow large international laboratory consolidators like us,
which benefit from high testing volumes across geographic markets, to further expand regional laboratory
clusters, improve efficiency and decrease overall costs.

**_We are a global player in the medical diagnostics space and the market leader in Europe by revenue with_**
**_comprehensive capabilities across a broad range of routine and specialty testing services and are well-_**
**_diversified across geographies, channels and payers._**

We are the largest clinical laboratory services company by revenue in Europe. Our revenue of
€3,250.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 25% greater than that of the


-----

second largest player in Europe and, like us, that player is estimated to have generated around one-quarter
of its 2022 revenue from COVID-19-related services. We are present in all three of the largest EU markets
by nominal GDP (i.e., France, Germany and Italy) and in the United Kingdom. We are one of the leaders
in each of these four countries, which we consider our core markets, as well as in other geographies. In
addition, we have established a strong presence in high-growth emerging markets across Eastern Europe,
Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. In total, we are present in 33 countries across five continents.
We have achieved leading positions in more than 20 countries, representing a significant proportion of the
countries in which we operate.

We draw numerous tangible scale benefits from our wide geographic footprint, leadership position in local
markets and full range of services. These include: the ability to offer more competitive contractual terms to
customers; enhanced procurement power; the ability to consolidate and automate procedures; the
knowledge and resources to create new capabilities (e.g., in retail or hospital settings); the critical mass to
build an integrated IT infrastructure; and the expertise to capitalize on opportunities for large-scale data
analytics. Scale is a critical differentiator driving costs down and creating a competitive advantage
compared to local and regional players.

We bring deep understanding of different market needs across the B2B, B2C and D2C business models,
adapting our services to local requirements to enhance patient experiences. This commercial and
operational flexibility is a key enabler of our new business generation, customer and payer diversification
and new market entry. We are well-diversified across the channels, with B2B contributing approximately
60% of our revenue and the remaining approximately 40% coming from B2C and D2C channels.

Our strong reputation, market position and proven expertise and presence across all testing categories,
enable us to attract and retain industry-leading medical experts and qualified specialists. As a result, we
have cultivated a wide network of medical experts, significantly enhancing our medical capabilities and
ability to innovate. Through close collaboration with research departments from universities and the
pharmaceutical industry, we continuously enhance our diagnostic offering. Furthermore, we have
accumulated vast expertise through our operational scale and global presence, which we leverage across
markets.

Our business also benefits from a wide payer base, including statutory and private insurance, hospital
systems, individual clinics and out-of-pocket spending. Our pan-European presence and expertise across
payer groups allows us to draw on our experience and know-how while entering new markets, adapt quickly
to local conditions and create value.

All of the above factors contribute to our well-balanced portfolio across business models, enabling us to
serve across different markets. This also ensures diversification across geographies, channels, nature of
contracts and types of tests, offering inherent stability and not materially exposing us to any single customer
or market segment.

**_Our customer-centric strategy is aimed at delivering above-market growth and is based on medical and_**
**_operational excellence and highly skilled employees._**

Our strategy of customer-centric medical excellence has yielded tangible results, including unlocking
additional organic revenue growth by providing a superior patient and clinician experience. We are capable
of delivering a highly customized end-to-end customer journey that includes registration, sampling,
diagnostics, reporting and consultation.

We operate an efficient hub-and-spoke network of laboratories (including approximately 30 "hub"
European reference laboratories and central laboratories and 420 "spoke" medical laboratories). Our "hub"
laboratories consist of two European reference laboratories (near Stuttgart, Germany and near Barcelona,
Spain) and additional central laboratories in all of our major countries, all of which perform specialty testing
services on samples provided from other network laboratories. In addition, our "spoke" laboratories, which
include regional laboratories, satellite laboratories and emergency laboratories, together with our point-ofcare testing capabilities, make up the backbone of our efficient hub-and-spoke model. Our "centers of
excellence" located across our laboratory network deliver medical expertise for certain medical areas and
have specialist diagnostic competencies. Through our laboratory network, we are able to offer a wide range
of analytical and diagnostic testing services, conducting over 600 million tests per year, including more
than 5,000 routine testing services in the field of clinical testing; genetic and anatomic pathology testing of
both histological and cytological samples; and diagnostic imaging. In the year ended December 31, 2022,


-----

our routine testing services provided approximately two-thirds of our revenue, while our specialty testing
services and our other services (e.g., anatomic pathology, examinations, genetics and imaging) each
represented approximately one-sixth of our revenue.

We offer a tailored approach to prescribers and focus on retail management capabilities. Our business has
a broad retail base with millions of patients and a large prescriber customer base. We develop innovative
products and provide value-added solutions to hospitals, dialysis centers, polyclinics, outpatient clinics,
laboratories and others via a variety of business models including point-of-care, management and supply,
outsourcing, joint ventures and consulting services. We adapt our business models (B2B, B2C or D2C) to
suit customer requirements, for example, by providing only certain specialty tests, entire laboratory
outsourcing services or special consultancy services as necessary to meet the specific needs of our
customers. This adaptability is one of our core strengths and is a testament to our customer-centric strategy.

Medical excellence is at the core of our business. We offer a full spectrum of approximately 5,000 different
testing services ranging from routine to highly specialized (including genetics, anatomic pathology,
radiology and nuclear medicine) and we have established ourselves as the top European player in anatomic
pathology and genetics. Our genetic testing capabilities include full exome sequencing, large gene panels
and single genetic variants. We also have capabilities covering all anatomic pathology sub-specialties.

We benefit from the shared medical knowledge of over 2,000 doctors and specialists and partnerships with
leading medical universities, which have fostered innovation and contributed to 368 medical publications
by SYNLAB scientists in 2022.

In addition, we have built a large and highly integrated platform of laboratories on a global scale with a
network of over 450 laboratories across 33 countries. This scale at global level creates unique advantages
by allowing us to centralize administrative functions and reduce costs. We also leverage our experience
across different countries to use the most optimal strategy for entry into new markets, addressing that
market's unique structure and allowing us to drive above-market growth and efficient integration. Our
extensive B2B operations, serving hospitals and physicians (e.g., in Germany, Italy and the United
Kingdom), account for around 60% of our revenue. We deploy a variety of strategies including systematic
campaigning by country to prescribers, developing demand management tools for clinicians and hospitals
and delivering high-end medical capabilities, reinforcing our medical leadership reputation. Our global
laboratory network and understanding of market segmentation positions us for rapid and professional
expansion in attractive new markets and enhanced ability to estimate and realize synergies when
acquisitions are made in new geographies. We also provide D2C operations focused on prevention and
wellness that are paid out-of-pocket in Italy, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, France and Hungary.

The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated our unique medical, operational and commercial capabilities. We
partnered with national healthcare systems and governments from the outset of the pandemic to develop
tests and procedures, leveraging our innovation expertise and securing supply chains early to rapidly roll
out testing internationally. This strengthened our position as a trusted medical partner and adviser globally
and allowed us to win contracts with businesses, educational institutions and sports associations to safely
get employees back to work, students back to school and athletes back on the playing field.

Our customer-centric strategy has resulted in above-market growth in our key markets. For example, over
the period from 2019 through 2023, our B2B business in Germany and the United Kingdom and our B2C
business in France and Italy all grew at CAGRs exceeding the market CAGRs for the same period. Our
German and UK B2B businesses generated revenue CAGRs of approximately 5% and 6%, respectively,
while the underlying markets grew at approximately 2% and 5%, respectively (in each case, excluding
SARS-CoV-2 testing revenue). Similarly, our French and Italian B2C businesses generated revenue
CAGRs of approximately 2% and 6%, respectively, ahead of underlying market growths of approximately
1% and 3%, respectively (in each case, excluding SARS-CoV-2 testing revenue), over the period.

**_We have a strong financial profile, with profitability accelerating through robust organic growth,_**
**_operational efficiencies, a disciplined approach to capital allocation and solid cash generation._**

We have consistently demonstrated solid growth, increasing our total revenue by a CAGR of 11.3%
between 2012 and 2022 (or 8.3% when excluding COVID-19-related revenue). We have largely exceeded
long-term revenue growth guidance of 3%, recently having posted 5.1% growth between January 1, 2022
and September 30, 2023 (consisting of 1.6% of pricing growth and 3.5% of volume growth).


-----

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrated outstanding revenue growth, largely driven by our
ability to capitalize on the SARS-CoV-2 testing opportunity and adapt to the changing macroeconomic
environment. Between 2020 and 2022, our total COVID-19-related revenue was approximately
€3.0 billion, with €618.0 million of COVID-19-related revenue in 2020, €1,579.0 million in 2021 and
€€789.0 million in 2022. Over the same period our Adjusted EBITDA Margin averaged 27.1% and our
Cash Conversion averaged 84.5%.

While our COVID-19-related revenue declined in 2022 from its peak in 2021, our base revenue from our
core business (excluding COVID-19-related revenue) posted 6.2% year-on-year revenue growth in the year
ended December 31, 2022, as a result of positive volume developments in routine (excluding SARS-CoV2) and specialty testing as well as positive price impacts driven by price indexation to inflation in certain
regions while experiencing reimbursement reduction in others. Overall, revenue for our core business
(excluding COVID-19-related revenue) grew at a 7.8% CAGR from €1,807.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to approximately €2,584.1 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023.

In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we delivered organic revenue growth of 6.9% year-on-year
(excluding COVID-19-related revenue), of which 5.4% was a result of increased volumes and the remaining
1.5% was a result of price growth. We expect our long-term revenue development to continue to be
supported by favorable structural growth trends and benefit from our various retail initiatives, such as
opening new blood collection points, strengthening our testing portfolios and D2C initiatives.

During the period from 2020 through 2022, our Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased significantly from
historic levels to 25.9% in 2020, 32.1% in 2021 and 23.2% in 2022, primarily as a result of the shift in
business mix towards significantly higher margin SARS-CoV-2 testing. As illustrated below, our quarterly
Adjusted EBITDA Margin declined through 2022 and has stabilized in 2023, albeit at a level that is below
that seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating a clear path for further improvement.

From 2022 through 2023 to date, COVID-19-related earnings have subsided significantly and our Adjusted
EBITDA Margin declined to 16.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was also partially
an outcome of the higher inflationary environment. We believe both SARS-CoV-2 testing, which has been
impacting our business mix, and the current high inflation levels, which are impacting our personnel and
operating expenses, are temporary factors that are affecting our business in the short term but are expected
to normalize over the medium term.

We expect 2023 to continue to be a year of normalization, with margins stabilizing as we refocus the
business on core fundamentals. Going forward, we expect margin recovery to occur as a result of (i) nearterm factors, such as the elimination of costs incurred as a publicly listed company that are not expected to
be incurred under private ownership and savings from the elimination of COVID-19-related personnel costs
and (ii) mid-term broader cost optimization as we continue to focus on cost base improvements through the
SALIX program.

In addition, we expect further margin uplifts to result from operating as a private company following the
Acquisition and from a ramp-up in the profitability of our Synnovis partnership in South East London with
Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, which
is a 15-year contract that began in 2021. Although this contract was initially margin dilutive, it is expected
to become accretive in the near term as we roll out a new centralized platform to replace the existing hospital
laboratory systems.


-----

We have a solid track-record of driving operational improvements and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
expansion through several cost savings initiatives, particularly SALIX, our leading operational excellence
program introduced in 2017. SALIX is executed locally, but systematically tracked centrally on an ongoing
basis. SALIX is broadly categorized between material expenses, personnel expenses and operating
expenses, focused on procurement efficiencies, headcount efficiencies, digitalization, automation and our
laboratory footprint. Historically, we have delivered €20–25 million in cost savings each year across the
SALIX program since inception and approximately €140 million since inception. In 2022, SALIX
generated approximately €25 million in total savings helping to partially offset the change in business mix
and inflationary pressure, with further ongoing savings expected over the medium term, including
€45 million estimated for the year ending December 31, 2023, €30 million of which was delivered in the
nine months ended September 30, 2023.

In addition to these cost savings, we have also generated savings on personnel costs through the reduction
and ultimate elimination of headcount specifically allocated to COVID-19-related functions. As full-time
capabilities related to COVID-19 are no longer driving significant revenue production as they did in 2021
and 2022, we have recalibrated our focus on allocating personnel in accordance with our underlying core
business. Since mid-2023, we have not had any personnel specifically employed for COVID-19-related
functions, which is down from 3,500 employees at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We have maintained our 2023 outlook and are on track to deliver on our €2.7 billion revenue guidance
(including greater than 4% organic growth), with 74% (€1,989.9 million) of 2023 revenue guidance having
been achieved in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (or €1,924.0 million after taking into account
acquisitions and disposals that occurred during the period). We also expect to reach our 16–18% Adjusted
EBITDA Margin guidance for 2023 and continue on our path to margin expansion in the long term on the
back of (i) stable volume growth, supported by geographical densification, improving operational and
logistical efficiency with a positive impact on profitability as well as positive impact from changing
business activity mix, with a view towards higher margin testing products in key geographies and
(ii) productivity gains, including the continued impact of our initiatives such as digitalization, laboratory
footprint optimization, the SYNLAB Transformation System ("STS") discussed below, headcount
efficiencies and automation. Reduced cost inflation, net of prices increases, could further result in a tailwind
and tangible lever to our future organic margin expansion. Our strong track record of accretive acquisitions
and synergies extraction, coupled with active portfolio management at all levels, is also expected to
positively contribute to our long-term profitability development.

Finally, our business benefits from relatively low levels of working capital and net capital expenditure,
which comprises acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets net of disposals of
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Due to our favorable business model, we are able to
generate strong cash flow despite the temporary macro-economic headwinds described above, generating
the capacity to de-lever while continuing to support our prudent acquisition strategy. Our Cash Conversion
(excluding non-recurring capital expenditures of €11 million in 2021, €34 million in 2022 and €50 million
the first nine months of 2023 related to the contract ramp-up of our Synnovis partnership agreement with
Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in South
East London) was 89% in the year ended December 31, 2021, 84% in the year ended December 31, 2022
and 72% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023.

**_We are a key market consolidator with an active portfolio management and disciplined acquisition_**
**_strategy and a demonstrated track record of disciplined acquisitions, successful integration and_**
**_efficiency realizations across geographies, with further consolidation opportunities in the fragmented_**
**_European and Latin American markets._**

We have a long history as a leading consolidator in the European clinical laboratory services market with
a proven ability to source and execute value accretive M&A, while also actively optimizing our portfolio
by divesting margin-dilutive and non-core businesses.

Consolidation of the market is driven by the introduction of new regulation, increased pressure on margins,
mandatory accreditations that increase costs for smaller players or individual laboratories, aging biologists
close to retirement looking for an exit and the ability to compete against scaled players. With large parts of
the market remaining unconsolidated, we have significant runway to further consolidate the market in our
key regions. Since the formation of the SYNLAB Group in the second half of 2015 through the first threequarters of 2023, we completed 159 acquisitions (excluding additional acquisitions in business units that
were sold during that period). While there is significant growth and consolidation potential remaining in


-----

the market and we believe we are well-positioned to continue to take advantage of opportunities as they
present themselves, our M&A strategy is, and will, continue to be disciplined; it is fully aligned to our core
strengths and additive to our organic growth levers.

We have well-established processes and structures in place that allow us to evaluate and steer our targets
from identification to due diligence and acquisition and on to the post-merger integration. These processes
with clear criteria for M&A are at the core of our disciplined approach to acquisitions. The plans for postmerger integration that are drawn up ahead of an acquisition and diligent execution thereof give us the
confidence that the expected value creation and deleveraging through synergies are aligned and achievable.
We benefit from a dedicated team focused on finding, evaluating and executing external growth
opportunities. We have developed a structured approach to acquisitions that capitalizes on the expertise and
market knowledge of both our management and local laboratory doctors. Our management team has a
strong track record of executing buy-and-build strategies through targeted acquisitions and the integration
of laboratories into group operations. We have consistently expanded our laboratory networks through
acquisitions.

We have a clear track-record of implementing operational efficiencies to realize synergies, cost savings and
drive improvements to gross and operating margins. Our size allows us to efficiently integrate and optimize
laboratory operations, procurement functions and production processes through the identification of best
practices and improving our information technology platforms. This includes our ability to extract
advantageous procurement conditions with our suppliers, in particular through our Group-wide panEuropean framework supply agreements for reagents, calibrators, quality controls and automates. After
acquiring clinical laboratories, we also implement efficiency measures aimed at increasing profitability
leveraging the application of relevant best practices from across our network.

We are also focused on optimization through a dynamic portfolio management strategy where we have
divested certain businesses, with a focus on either (i) lower-margin businesses and geographies or
(ii) selling assets where accretive multiples are achievable and using the proceeds to de-lever or reinvest in
efficient operations. As part of this strategy, in July 2023, we completed the sale of our Swiss business,
which had been dilutive to margins in recent years, allowing us to reduce our net debt by approximately
€154 million, and, in September 2023, we completed the sale of our veterinary business in Belgium,
Germany and Spain, disposing of a non-core business that accounted for less than 1% of our total revenue
in the year ended December 31, 2022, resulting in net proceeds of approximately €194 million.

**_We benefit from a highly experienced international management team at group and local levels, who are_**
**_well aligned on strategy, with deep market knowledge and experience in navigating local regulatory_**
**_requirements and delivering growth. This team is well supported by shareholder representatives with_**
**_deep knowledge of the medical diagnostic sector._**

Our more than 27,000 employees, including over 2,000 medical doctors and other specialists in our
laboratories, are led by our chief executive officer, Mathieu Floreani and our chief financial officer, Sami
Badarani. Mr. Floreani first joined the Group as Deputy CEO of SYNLAB Limited in 2017 and became
CEO in 2018, having previously held CEO and executive positions in several leading global businesses,
including the Forwarding division of DHL Americas and McKinsey, over his more than 30-year career.
Mr. Badarani also joined the Group in 2017 and has over 30 years of experience, having previously served
as CFO of Bureau Veritas, Director of Group Finance of Alliance Boots and CFO of GE Energy Contractual
Services.

Our executive-level management team is supported by our experienced international management team in
the implementation of our strategies. In addition, we benefit from the experience of the CEOs of our four
operating segments and our strong country management teams that have deep market knowledge and
experience in navigating local regulatory requirements and acquiring and integrating new laboratories. Our
management team has a demonstrated track record of delivering growth, executing and integrating
acquisitions and driving operational efficiencies. This has led to a continuing transformation of our
business, including its impact on environmental, social and governance practices.

We believe the industry knowledge and leadership of our senior and country management teams, combined
with their long-term experience, provide us with the skills necessary for continuously improving our
performance and efficiency through a common corporate infrastructure and the implementation of best
practices across our network, constituting a significant competitive advantage.


-----

In addition, we have a strong shareholder base through Cinven, as well as key minority investors, including
the Qatar Investment Authority and Dr. Bartl Wimmer, the founder of SYNLAB. Cinven, which will
become our majority shareholder following the Acquisition, has intimate knowledge of the company and a
deep understanding of the sector and the underlying trends, having been our majority shareholder from
2015 until our initial public offering and having remained our largest shareholder following our initial
public offering. Cinven has signed an investment agreement backing our long-term strategy and we
anticipate continued positive cooperation with them.

**Our Strategy**

We intend to grow our business and maintain our position as the leading provider of clinical laboratory
services in Europe by executing a strategy of customer-centric medical excellence as described below.

**_We aim to provide a superior patient and clinician experience by expanding our service offering,_**
**_strengthening our network and creating a differentiated brand identity across Europe and_**
**_internationally, driving organic revenue growth._**

We have leading positions in key geographical areas and have created a fully integrated business with
strong brand recognition and reputation on the basis of which we intend to deliver world-class service to
our patients and our customers. We will continue to leverage our reputation to reinforce the public
perception of the quality and breadth of our services, to attract new customers as well as skilled medical
staff, particularly doctors and other primary care physicians.

We have committed to a strategy of medical expertise and scientific leadership based on the highest
standards of quality, ethics and reliability. We aim to continuously invest in our facilities, technologies and
scientists. We plan to maintain and reinforce our "centers of excellence" culture across our laboratory
network, not only within larger European reference laboratories and central laboratories but also in smaller
ones. We also intend to further develop our medical expertise by ensuring that all our laboratories continue
to be fully accredited in accordance with the highest local standards and by maintaining industry leadership
in self-regulation, governance and participation in pan-European scientific committees. The voice of our
experts is increasingly heard in all of the healthcare systems we work with and we aim to increase this
active participation in the medical discussions of the topics of our time, as evidenced during the COVID19 pandemic. We also remain alert to changing trends in testing patterns and continue to introduce new
tests that position us at the forefront of the medical diagnostics field.

Leveraging this medical expertise, we will continue providing customers with accurate test results with the
highest possible medical precision, the shortest possible turnaround time and the lowest possible analysis
error rate. Customer experience is also enhanced via additional services (e.g., counselling services pre- and
post-test). In addition to this, we will also continue to roll out "SYNLAB Access," an intuitive digitalized
tool with a focus on enhancing the patient journey.

As some healthcare systems are coming under significant budgetary pressures, public and private hospitals,
organizations and other healthcare providers are seeking to improve the productivity and the medical quality
of their services by outsourcing inefficient and sub-scale laboratory activities to diagnostics experts. We
are well-placed to take advantage of this trend as we can provide a full spectrum of outsourcing solutions,
ranging from referral testing services to full outsourcing with the transfer of entire teams and assets, most
notably in France, Finland, Germany, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. For example, we have been
entrusted with the largest hospital outsourcing contract ever granted in the United Kingdom; the Synnovis
partnership in South East London with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College
Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. This project aims to deliver a capital efficient service modernization
program with leading service digitalization, implementing digital pathology, allowing access to our global
clinical network, driving reduction of laboratory estates and cost of testing. This experience and track record
positions us well as more hospital systems consider outsourcing.

Under the growth initiatives program "For You," we systematically implement campaigns in each country
and enhance sales force effectiveness with prescribers, develop connectivity with clinicians and tools for
demand management. We also continuously reinforce our medical leadership, reputation and establish
clinical partnerships. At the same time, we continually increase the number of specialty tests in order to
provide a broader service offering across our network, for example by continuing to identify and
introducing testing services in various geographies and therefore creating a consistent and increasing panEuropean products and services offering driving further growth.


-----

We also invest significantly in selected areas, such as patient and doctor interfaces to increase client-base
proximity and in AI technologies to enhance customer service and satisfaction propositions. Moreover, we
have launched our D2C proposition focusing on prevention and wellness. Leveraging our extensive
experience in running a web shop in Estonia that we have operated since 2017, pilot D2C projects were
launched in the United Kingdom and Italy in 2022 and subsequently expanded to Portugal, Spain, France
and Hungary. We expect this market to evolve and capture a growing share of the medical diagnostics
market.

We are also focused on leveraging our scientific and operational know-how to deliver our sophisticated
propositions in higher growth emerging markets, mainly with respect to Latin America (including
Colombia, Mexico, Chile and Peru) and Africa (Nigeria and Ghana).

**_We will sustain our focus on innovation and operational excellence by leveraging our scale, capabilities_**
**_and supplier relationships to drive operating efficiencies and profitability._**

We utilize technological innovations like state-of-the-art software, AI and digitalization to further improve
our diagnostic service processes and simplify our business. For example, our implementation of eXtensible
Business Reporting Language (XBRL) simplifies our reporting formats and addresses audit regulations.
Similarly, digitalization in diagnostic services enables us to support the work of our colleagues and
employees. This also helps us work efficiently with physicians and improves how they deliver treatment
and medical care. We have also established a team that will leverage AI to refine our customer solutions
offering, based on our proprietary data, which will further help us pioneer new opportunities. Our strategy
is to focus on providing decision support through rule-based annotation support, develop demand control
tools and enable virtual consultation by means of digital communication. This not only positions us to
deliver stronger customer experience but also reduces costs by leveraging technology and improving
operations.

We intend to continue leveraging our extensive network to streamline our laboratory operations and
administrative functions and to strengthen our post-merger integration processes and capabilities while
enhancing our service offering. In doing so, we aim to continue reducing our operating costs through
operational efficiency improvements across our laboratory network and the optimization of procurement
contracts at lower costs. This is captured under our SALIX program, which is focused on regaining preCOVID-19 pandemic productivity and is driven by implementing identified global initiatives including
procurement contracts, targeted COVID-19 employee and other personnel reductions, supply chain
management, process standardization and digitalization.

SALIX is underpinned by three key pillars. The first pillar is procurement (captured under material
expenditure). We seek to leverage our scale to save on direct and indirect costs, thereby reducing materials
costs and operating expenses. The second pillar is the SYNLAB Transformation System ("STS"), which is
based on Lean Six Sigma principles (automation, workspace design, planning and scheduling, multi-skilled
workforce, standardization, performance management). STS is a management system supporting our
strategy and is considered the engine driving us to operational excellence by enabling customer centricity,
productivity increases and a healthy organization. STS also has the effect of reducing operating (captured
under operational expenditure) and personnel expenses (captured under personnel expenditure). All cost
savings from STS are transferred into SALIX. The third pillar is focused on our laboratory network,
including refining our "hub" and "spoke" network, ensuring it has superior logistics and reliable technical
service and maintenance functions. This pillar also has the effect of reducing operating and personnel
expenses. In 2022, SALIX generated cost savings of €25 million, with savings of material expenses
accounting for 42%, personnel expenses for 22% and operational expenses for 35%.

In addition, we are focused on network optimization, especially in areas with limited density of blood
collection points, which impacts margins. We actively manage our blood collection point network either
by opening or refurbishing existing blood collection points or acquiring blood collection points locally to
expand our reach and extend our scale. Within blood collection points, we are rolling out the STS across
the platform, resulting in lower waiting times, improved NPS scores and increasing revenue from out-ofpocket services.

**_We will develop our talent by empowering and engaging our employees._**

To deliver a best-in-class service for our patients and customers, we rely on committed and qualified people.
Employees are the interface to patients and customers and are critical to our success.


-----

Employee engagement, with the objective of driving enhanced organizational performance, is a key pillar
of our strategy. This effort is reflected in three Group-wide initiatives: (i) the SYNLAB Leadership Model
(ACCE), (ii) the SYNLAB Campus and (iii) SYNLAB Dialogue. The SYNLAB Leadership Model
(ACCE) is a proprietary model of leadership training that aims to align individual management actions to
the principles and values shared within the company. The SYNLAB Campus is one of the core platforms
for people development, focused on creating a new way of working based on a culture of collaboration and
reflecting our values of passion, accountability and customer centricity. SYNLAB Campus provides
professional development courses and training to enhance personal and professional effectiveness, as well
as further Group-level initiatives. SYNLAB Dialogue is a Group-wide annual survey that gives employees
an opportunity to anonymously share their views with the organization and is intended to serve as a base
for improving our human capital and driving continuous improvements to continue to be recognized as a
great place to work.

In addition, our human resources strategy is also focused on establishing successful talent and succession
management programs, establishing an environmental, social and governance ("ESG") company culture
that demonstrates commitment to corporate social responsibility and sustainability and enables clear
performance management processes throughout the organization.

Other programs implemented include acknowledgement of employee contributions (e.g., by offering
medical awards and research grants), dual education opportunities and the creation of a work environment
that minimizes the risk of accidents.

We have a strong focus on ESG with a dedicated board committee monitoring the progress of our ESG
strategy. It is based on three pillars, SYNLAB Green, SYNLAB Care and SYNLAB Citizenship. Our new
central laboratories including our Synnovis partnership agreement with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS
Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in South East London, our new
central laboratory in Munich, Germany and ongoing construction of a new medical center in Florence, Italy
adhere to the highest ESG standards.

**_We will pursue growth and profitability opportunities through efficient capital allocation, investments_**
**_in our business and selective acquisitions / divestments in current and new markets._**

We operate a highly cash generative model, with a major focus on accounts receivable and managing capital
expenditure efficiently. Ensuring capital is efficiently allocated to facilitate growth opportunities is critical.

From 2018 through 2022, we invested around €110 million per year on average in targeted infrastructure
developments to support our operational excellence strategy. Infrastructure investments typically include
new blood collection points and commercial activities, logistics infrastructure, diagnostic centers,
improvements in existing laboratory and blood collection point facilities, laboratory equipment, customer
interaction and end-user service platforms, as well as back office and IT. In 2021, beyond the normal
investments in our core activities and in further response to the COVID-19 pandemic, significant
investments were made to set up appropriate SARS-CoV-2 testing capabilities across the network. These
investments position us well for the medium term, with fewer one-off capital expenditures expected and
better control over leases expansion going forward.

We also benefit from a prudent and disciplined external growth strategy, focused on a balanced and lower,
as compared to previous years, annual spend in the medium term (approximately €75 million investment
on M&A as of September 30, 2023, in line with our planned reduction in 2023 from levels of M&A
spending in prior years) and increased focus on accretive bolt-on acquisitions as opposed to transformative
and large-scale deals, with tangible scope to generate operational efficiencies and synergies. Our ability to
integrate these acquisitions and extract cost savings are a key contributor to our profitability. We are
typically able to realize synergies within 12–24 months from acquisition, primarily by optimizing costs
through group level advantages in procurement and other functions and through streamlining personnel
expenses, leveraging group supplier contracts and existing group and regional support functions. We also
have a disciplined approach to entry price, focusing on post-synergies valuations of approximately 9-12x
EBITDA.

Given our strong cash flow performance, we can generally self-finance planned acquisitions, mostly made
up of highly accretive bolt-on acquisitions. Generally, we see ourselves in a strong financial position to
continue consolidating the market and creating value from our own resources. In 2023, we have temporarily


-----

reduced our M&A spending from historic levels to fully focus the business on achieving the same
productivity level as before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Separately, we have an active portfolio management strategy. We continuously monitor performance at the
level of countries, segments, entity, contract or customer groups, with a reinforced focus on countries or
segments with low margins (less than 10% Adjusted EBITDA Margin), divesting lower performing assets
or assets that can be sold at highly accretive multiples. We evaluate market structure, degree of
consolidation, critical scale required in the market, organic growth of laboratory testing services in the
country and reimbursement and regulation trends. While the most immediate focus is on assets with
Adjusted EBITDA Margins below 10%, we also aim to decrease the revenue contribution of businesses
with margins below 20% (which contributed approximately 52% of our revenue in the first half of 2023)
and look for opportunities to simplify our business model. The completed sale of our veterinary diagnostics
business in Belgium, Germany and Spain in September 2023 and of our business operations in Switzerland
in July 2023, are outcomes of such evaluation. These businesses were sold for attractive multiples and were
margin accretive for the whole Group, with cash inflow from the sale of subsidiaries, net of cash disposed
and changes in debt having amounted to €346 million. The proceeds have been reinvested and utilized for
the purposes of deleveraging (including repaying in full €220 million of term loan B debt under a facility
that was outstanding at the time in July 2023).

**The Transactions**

**_The Acquisition_**

On September 29, 2023, the Bidder, an entity controlled by funds managed and/or advised by Cinven,
announced its decision to launch a public acquisition offer for all outstanding shares of the Target not
directly held by it at a price of €10.00 per share in cash (the "Acquisition Offer"). The offer price
represented a premium of approximately 42% to the Xetra closing share price of the Target on March 10,
2023, which was the last trading day prior to the Target's ad hoc announcement of a non-binding expression
of interest by Cinven.

The offer acceptance period for the Acquisition Offer ran from October 23, 2023 to November 20, 2023, at
which time the Bidder had secured a total of 188,112,767 shares, representing 84.7% of the share capital
and 85.6% of the voting rights of the Target through a combination of (i) the Bidder's own holdings at the
commencement of the Acquisition Offer, (ii) co-investment agreements, (iii) irrevocable undertakings to
tender or (iv) other public tenders. In connection with the Acquisition, following settlement of the
Acquisition Offer, all of the shares of the Target held by the Bidder and Ephios Holdco will be transferred
to Ephios Bidco (the "Share Push-Down"). Following the consummation of the Share Push-Down, Ephios
Bidco may, subject to economic and regulatory circumstances, which may include the development of the
stock exchange trading price of the Target shares and the number of shares that it has secured, consider
implementing one or more structural measures, including, in cooperation with the Management Board,
announcing and implementing a delisting procedure pursuant to Section 39 of the German Stock Exchange
Act (Börsengesetz) and the withdrawal of the admission for trading of the Target's shares from the open
market segments of the relevant stock exchanges and, subject to the Squeeze-Out Threshold being met,
implementing a squeeze-out procedure.

Completion of the Acquisition Offer remains subject to regulatory clearances. Subject to receipt of these
regulatory clearances, the Acquisition Offer is expected to be settled in the first quarter of 2024. However,
this timing indication is an estimate and it is not possible to make a binding commitment as to if and when
all regulatory proceedings will be completed.

For additional information, see "The Transactions—The Acquisition."

**_The Financing_**

The Acquisition Offer is expected to be financed using (i) the gross proceeds of the Offering (upon
satisfaction of the conditions to release the proceeds of the Offering from the Escrow Account),
(ii) borrowings under the New Term Loan B and (iii) the proceeds of certain committed and fully
subordinated PIK debt to be issued by Ephios Subco 1 on or prior to the Completion Date and on-lent to
the Issuer. The funds will be lent to the Bidder and (i) used to fund the Acquisition Offer for all tendered
shares of the Target, (ii) offered to the Target to be used, together with cash on the Target's balance sheet,
to repay certain existing external indebtedness of the Target Group and (iii) used to pay the fees, premiums

(6) A portion of the funds received by the Issuer through the issuance of the Notes and borrowings under the New Term Loan B will be advanced from the Issuer
to the Target via an intercompany loan for purposes of repaying the €535.0 million of borrowings under the Existing Term Loan A outstanding as of the date
of this Offering Memorandum. Such repayment is expected to be either (i) if the Squeeze-Out Threshold is met, in cash or (ii) if the Squeeze-Out Threshold
is not met, facilitated with a shareholder loan from the Issuer to the Target on terms acceptable to the Target.

In the event that the number of Target shares held by the Bidder does not meet the Squeeze-Out Threshold, the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B is also
expected to be repaid in part or in full using cash on the Target's balance sheet, proceeds of the Offering and/or borrowings under the New Term Loan B that
are not required to be utilized for purposes of acquiring shares of the Target. Any such repayment will be facilitated by an additional shareholder loan from

_Facilities." A portion of the funds received by the Issuer through borrowings under the New Term Loan B and the issuance of the Notes will be advanced_
from the Issuer to Ephios Bidco via the intercompany loan designated in the chart above as "ICL B." The terms and conditions of ICL B broadly mirror those
of the Notes and the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement, subject to an interest rate with an arm's-length margin to be determined based on a transfer pricing
study conducted by an independent advisor.

(9) The Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer, will rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness or obligations of the
Issuer that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes (including the obligations of the Issuer under the New Revolving Credit Facility
and the New Term Loan B) and will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness or obligations of the Issuer that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The Notes will be effectively senior to any existing and future Indebtedness or obligations of the Issuer that is
not secured by the Collateral, to the extent of the value of such Collateral and will be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or
obligations (including obligations to trade creditors) of the Issuer that are secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the
value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness or obligations. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness
or obligations of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes. On the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured only by a first-priority security
interest in the Issue Date Collateral. On or about the Completion Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes and the Note Guarantees (as
applicable) will be secured on a first-ranking basis by the Completion Date Collateral. In the event that the number of Target shares held by the Bidder does
not meet the Squeeze-Out Threshold on or before the Completion Date, the Notes will also be secured from a date promptly after the Completion Date until
the date on which until the Squeeze-Out Threshold is met, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, on a first-ranking basis by the Pre-Squeeze-Out Collateral.
Within 180 days following the Control Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes and the Note Guarantees (as applicable), will be secured on
a first-ranking basis by the Post-Completion Collateral.

A portion of the funds received by the Issuer through the issuance of the Notes and borrowings under the New Term Loan B will be advanced from the Issuer
to Ephios Bidco via the intercompany loan designated in the chart above as "ICL B." The terms and conditions of ICL B broadly mirror those of the Notes
and the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement, subject to an interest rate with an arm's-length margin to be determined based on an analysis conducted by an
independent advisor.

(10) On or around the Issue Date, the Issuer intends to enter into the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement, which will provide for the New Revolving Credit Facility
of up to €500.0 million. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the New Revolving Credit Facility is not expected to be drawn as of the Completion

publicly held, have not been tendered and are not subject to co-investment agreements or irrevocable undertakings. On or after the date of this Offering
Memorandum, the Bidder may acquire, directly or indirectly, if and to the extent legally permissible, any such publicly held shares outside of the Acquisition
Offer on or off the stock exchange and may implement certain structural measures in order to facilitates such share acquisitions. See "The Transactions—The
_Acquisition—Further Acquisitions of Target Shares" and "—Structural Measures" for additional information. In the event that the number of shares held by_
the Bidder does not meet the Squeeze-Out Threshold, there will be certain minority shareholders in the Target following the Acquisition.

(12) On December 10, 2020, SYNLAB Bondco PLC, a subsidiary of the Target, entered into an amendment and restatement of its senior secured term loan
facilities agreement, which provides for the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B in the amount of €385.0 million, which has been borrowed by SYNLAB Bondco
PLC and is outstanding as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and, except as set out below, is expected to remain outstanding following the Transactions.
See "Description of Other Indebtedness—Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B Facility."

In the event that the number of Target shares held by the Bidder does not meet the Squeeze-Out Threshold, the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B is expected
to be repaid in part or in full using cash on the Target's balance sheet, proceeds of the Offering and/or borrowings under the New Term Loan B that are not

_Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations," "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The Note Guarantees and_
_other security interests may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and_
_enforceability," "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The insolvency laws of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to you as the laws of other_
_jurisdictions. Furthermore, the Issuer may shift its "centre of main interests" to jurisdictions that are less favorable to you.," "Risk Factors—Risks Related_
_to the Notes—The Note Guarantees and other security interests may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may_
_adversely affect their validity and enforceability," and "Description of the Notes—The Note Guarantees."_

The Note Guarantees may be released without the consent of the holders of the Notes under certain circumstances. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes," "Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement" and "Description of the Notes—Note Guarantees—Release of Note Guarantees."_

(14) Certain of the Target's subsidiaries will not guarantee the Notes. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B is
expected to remain outstanding following the Acquisitions, in which case the Target's subsidiaries that are not expected to guarantee the Notes will have
€385.0 million of external indebtedness as of the Completion Date, corresponding to the outstanding borrowings under the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B.
In the event that the number of Target shares held by the Bidder does not meet the Squeeze-Out Threshold, the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B is expected
to be repaid in part or in full, in which case the external indebtedness of the Target's subsidiaries that are not expected to guarantee the Notes will be reduced
by a corresponding amount.

Guarantors (being loans downstreaming the proceeds of the
Notes or the equity contribution into the Group on or around
the Completion Date); and

                 - a pledge (without control/notification, prior to enforcement) of
the Issuer's material bank accounts

(together, the ''Post-Completion Collateral'' and, together with the
Completion Date Collateral, and, if applicable, the Pre-Squeeze-Out
Collateral, the ''Collateral'').

The Collateral will also include any additional security interest that may
in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes and the
Note Guarantees.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Collateral will be pledged
pursuant to the Security Documents, directly or via the Security Agent,
to the holders of the secured obligations that are secured by the


-----

Collateral, including, on a first priority basis, the Holders, the lenders
under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the New Term Loan B.
Any proceeds received upon any enforcement of the Collateral would
be applied pro rata in repayment of all obligations under the Notes and
any other Indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral on a pari passu
basis. See "Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement" and "—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness_
_and Issuance of Preferred Stock." Subject to certain conditions,_
including compliance with the provisions described under "Description
_of the Notes—Impairment of Security Interest" and "Description of the_
_Notes—Liens," the Issuer is permitted to pledge the Collateral in_
connection with future issuances of its Indebtedness or Indebtedness of
the Restricted Subsidiaries, including Additional Notes, as permitted
under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The security interests over the Collateral or the enforcement thereof will
be subject to certain significant contractual and legal limitations or
subject to certain defenses under applicable law. By virtue of these
limitations and defenses, the value of certain Collateral could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or
such Collateral may have effectively limited or no value. See
"Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and
_Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations" and_
"Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes."

The security interests may be released without the consent of the
holders of the Notes under certain circumstances. See "Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Notes," "Description of Other Indebtedness—_
_Intercreditor Agreement" and "Description of the Notes—Security—_
_Release of Liens."_

**Use** **of** **Proceeds ...........................** The gross proceeds of the Offering will be placed into the Escrow
Account on the Issue Date. Upon satisfaction of the conditions to
release the proceeds of the Offering from the Escrow Account, the gross
proceeds of the Offering will be used together with (i) borrowings under
the New Term Loan B and (ii) the proceeds of certain committed and
fully subordinated PIK debt to be issued by Ephios Subco 1 on or prior
to the Completion Date and on-lent to the Issuer to finance the
Acquisition Offer. The funds will be lent to the Bidder and (i) used to
fund the Acquisition Offer for all tendered shares of the Target,
(ii) offered to the Target to be used, together with cash on the Target's
balance sheet, to repay certain existing external indebtedness of the
Target Group and (iii) used to pay the fees, premiums and expenses
incurred in connection with the Acquisition Offer and the Financing,
including estimated fees and expenses to be incurred in connection with
the Offering. See ''Use of Proceeds."

**Escrow of** **Proceeds .....................** Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuer
will deposit or arrange to have deposited the gross proceeds of the
offering of the Notes into an escrow account (the "Escrow Account")
in the name of the Issuer pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement
(the "Escrow Agreement"), dated as of the Issue Date among the
Issuer, the Trustee and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., acting through its
London branch, as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"). The initial
funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds credited to
the Escrow Account (less any funds paid in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement), are referred to, collectively, as the "Escrowed Funds."
The Escrow Account will be in the name of the Issuer in which the
Escrow Agent will receive into its custody the Escrowed Funds. The
Escrow Account will be charged on a first-priority basis in favor of the
Trustee on behalf and for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to an


-----

escrow account charge dated the Issue Date between the Issuer and the
Trustee (the "Escrow Account Charge").

**Special Mandatory Redemption** In the event that (a) the satisfaction of the conditions for release of the
Escrowed Funds does not take place on or prior to September 29, 2024
(the ''Escrow Longstop Date''), (b) the Issuer certifies to the Trustee
and the Escrow Agent that the Investment Agreement has been validly
and conclusively terminated, or that, in the reasonable judgment of the
Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated by the Escrow
Longstop Date, (c) the Initial Investors (as defined under the heading
titled "Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions") cease to
beneficially own and control, directly or indirectly, a majority of the
issued and outstanding Capital Stock of the Bidder on or prior to the
Escrow Longstop Date or (d) there is an Event of Default with respect
to the Issuer under clause (5) or (6) of the first paragraph under the
heading titled "Description of the Notes—Events of Default" on or prior
to the Escrow Longstop Date (each such event being a "Special
**Mandatory Redemption Event"), the Issuer will redeem all of the**
Notes (the "Special **Mandatory Redemption") at a price equal to**
100.0% of the initial issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date, or, if
applicable, from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or
provided for, to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption
Date (the "Special Mandatory Redemption Price"). See "Description
_of the Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption."_

**Optional Redemption .................** At any time prior to          , 2026, the Issuer may redeem all or,
from time to time, a part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a "make-whole" premium,
as described under "Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption,"
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but
not including, the applicable redemption date.

In addition, prior to          , 2026, at any time during any
twelve-month period commencing on the Issue Date, the Issuer may
redeem up to 10% of the original principal amount of the Notes issued
(including the original principal amount of any Additional Notes) at a
redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to (but
excluding) the applicable redemption date.

Prior to          , 2026, the Issuer may, on one or more occasions,
redeem up to 40% of the original principal amount of the Notes issued
(including the original principal amount of any Additional Notes) with
the proceeds from specified equity offerings at a redemption price equal
to       % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to (but excluding) the applicable
redemption date, provided that, inter alia, at least 50% of the original
principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount
of any Additional Notes) issued under the Indenture remains
outstanding. See "Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption."

The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes at any time on or
after          , 2026 at the redemption prices described under
"Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption."


**Additional** **Amounts; Tax**

**Redemption ..............................**


All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or Guarantors under or
with respect to the Notes or its Note Guarantee, as the case may be, will
be made without withholding or deduction for taxes or other
governmental charges in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined
in "Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts"), except to the


-----

extent required by law. If withholding or deduction is required by law,
the Issuer or Guarantors will pay additional amounts so that the net
amount you receive is no less than that which you would have received
in the absence of such withholding or deduction, subject to certain
exceptions. See "Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts."

If certain changes in the law of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
become effective that would impose withholding taxes or other
deductions on the payments on the Notes, the Issuer may redeem the
Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of
100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. See "Description
_of the Notes—Redemption for Changes in Taxes."_

**Change** **of** **Control ......................** Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, the Issuer will
be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase
price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date
of the purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date). See "Description of the Notes—Change of Control." However, a
change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if, pro forma for
such change of control, a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not
exceeded in connection with such event.

**Tender Offers ..............................** In connection with any tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less
than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding
Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender
offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in
lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the
right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in
part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to
each other holder of Notes (excluding any early tender or incentive fee).
See "Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption."

**Certain Covenants ......................** The Indenture will limit, among other things, the ability of the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries to:

                 - incur or guarantee certain indebtedness and issue certain
preferred stock;

                 - pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase its capital stock;

                 - make certain restricted payments;

                 - make certain investments or loans;

                 - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                 - impose restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay
dividends or make other payments to us;

                 - merge or consolidate with other entities, or make certain asset
sales;

                 - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

                 - impair the security interests for the benefit of the Holders;


-----

                 - guarantee certain indebtedness without also guaranteeing the
Notes; and

                 - undertake activities other than those customarily undertaken by
a holding company.

Certain of the covenants and events of default will be suspended if and
for as long as we achieve investment-grade ratings. See "Description of
_the_ _Notes—Certain_ _Covenants—Suspension_ _of_ _Covenants_ _on_

_Achievement of Investment Grade Status."_

Each of the covenants in the Indenture will be subject to significant
exceptions and qualifications. See "Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants."_

**Transfer Restrictions ..................** The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities
Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be
offered or sold, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities
Act. We have not agreed to, or otherwise undertaken to, register the
Notes (including by way of an exchange offer). See "Notice to
_Investors."_

**Listing ..........................................** Application is expected to be made to the Authority to list the Notes on
the Official List and for permission to be granted to deal in the Notes
on the Official List. There can be no assurance that the application to
the Authority to list the Notes on the Official List will be approved or
that permission to deal in the Notes thereon will be granted, and
settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or
permission.

**No Prior Market ............................** The Notes will be new securities for which there is no market. Although
certain of the Initial Purchasers have informed us that they intend to
make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and they
may discontinue market making at any time without notice.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the
Notes will develop or be maintained.

**Risk** **Factors ...................................** Investing in the Notes involves substantial risks. You should carefully
consider all of the information in this Offering Memorandum and, in
particular, you should evaluate the specific risk factors set forth in the
"Risk Factors" section before making a decision whether to invest in
the Notes.

**Governing Law ...........................** The Notes, the Indenture and the Escrow Agreement will be governed
by New York law.

The Intercreditor Agreement, the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement and
the Escrow Account Charge will be governed by the laws of England
and Wales.

The Security Documents will be governed by applicable local law.

**Trustee .........................................** U.S. Bank Trustees Limited.

**Escrow Agent ..............................** JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., acting through its London branch.

**Security Agent .............................** Alter Domus Trustees (UK) Limited.

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER DATA**

The following tables set forth summary historical financial information and summary unaudited interim
condensed consolidated financial information of the Target Group for the periods and dates indicated.

The Issuer is a newly incorporated holding company formed for the purposes of consummating the Transactions.
Following the Acquisition, the Issuer will be the indirect parent of the Target. The Issuer has not engaged in any
activities other than those related to its formation and the Transactions and does not expect to have any business
operations, material assets or liabilities other than its interest in the issued and outstanding shares of its subsidiaries
and outstanding indebtedness and intercompany balances incurred in connection with the Transactions. We do
not present in this Offering Memorandum any financial information or financial statements of the Issuer, other
than certain limited financial data presented at the Issuer level on a combined basis as adjusted to reflect the
Transactions.

The consolidated financial information included in this Offering Memorandum has been derived as follows:

   - the consolidated financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 has been
derived from the 2022 Financial Statements;

   - the consolidated financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 has been
derived from the comparative figures for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in the 2022
Financial Statements;

   - the consolidated financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 has been
derived from the comparative figures for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in the 2021
Financial Statements; and

   - the consolidated financial information as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and
September 30, 2022 has been derived from the Interim Financial Statements.

The results of operations for prior years are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future
period. Interim financial results are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year or any future
reporting period.

In the consolidated statement of financial position included in the 2021 Financial Statements, financial non-current
assets are presented as part of "other non-current assets" and financial current assets are presented as part of the
"other current assets." In the 2022 Financial Statements, the presentation was changed as "financial non-current
assets" and "financial current assets" are presented as separate line items in the consolidated statement of financial
position. Accordingly, the presentation of the comparative figures for the year ended December 31, 2021 included
in the 2022 Financial Statements was adjusted.

The unaudited consolidated income statement information and the other financial information presented for the
LTM Period have been derived by subtracting the consolidated financial information for the nine months ended
September 30, 2022 included as comparative financial information in the Interim Financial Statements or derived
from SYNLAB AG's internal accounting system from the consolidated financial information for the year ended
December 31, 2022 derived from the 2022 Financial Statements or derived from SYNLAB AG's internal
accounting system and adding the consolidated financial information for the nine months ended September 30,
2023 derived from the Interim Financial Statements or derived from SYNLAB AG's internal accounting system.
The unaudited consolidated income statement information and the other financial information presented for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2023 have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily
representative of SYNLAB AG's results of operations for any future period or SYNLAB AG's financial condition
at any future date. This data has been prepared solely for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum and has not
been audited, reviewed or otherwise been verified by any external auditors.

The financial data below also includes certain Non-IFRS measures used to evaluate our economic and financial
performance. These measures are not identified as accounting measures pursuant to IFRS or any generally
accepted accounting standards and therefore should not be considered as alternative measures to evaluate our
performance. See "Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Other Financial Measures—Non-IFRS
_Measures."_

This information is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with "Risk Factors," "Capitalization,"
"Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Information," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations," the Interim Financial Statements and the notes thereto and the_
Audited Financial Statements and the accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum,
as well as the other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum.

(1) Our total revenue is composed of our base revenue and COVID-19-related revenue. The classification of revenue as either base revenue
or COVID-19-related revenue requires our management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that they believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances. However, such classifications are inexact and should not be unduly relied upon. The following tables present a
quarterly breakdown of our revenue, including the proportion of our revenue that was COVID-19-related for the periods indicated.

(2) Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted EBITDA and _Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial_
performance under IFRS or any other internationally accepted accounting policy and should not be considered as alternatives to other
indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS any other
internationally accepted accounting policy. Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA,
as presented in this Offering Memorandum, may differ from, and may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other
companies.

We define Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for covenant adjustments, management adjustments,
_pro forma adjustments and illustrative run-rate adjustments, as described in footnotes 1(f), 1(g), 1(h) and 1(i) below, respectively, and to_
adjust our COVID-19-related EBITDA to the expected future annual EBITDA contribution of COVID-19-related testing by eliminating
excess COVID-19-related EBITDA above that amount. This information does not represent the results we would have achieved had each
of the transactions for which an adjustment is made occurred at the dates indicated. This information is inherently subject to risks and
uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations of the transactions for the
periods presented and may not be comparable to the financial statements or the other financial information included in this offering
memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision.

We present Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA for informational purposes only.
There is no assurance that items that we have identified for adjustment as non-underlying will not recur in the future or that similar items
will not be incurred in the future. The calculations for Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted
EBITDA are based on various assumptions, management estimates and unaudited management accounts. These amounts have not been
and, in certain cases, cannot be audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted
EBITDA and Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as
a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under IFRS. See "Presentation of Financial and Other Information."

____________

(a) Restructuring and other significant expenses includes (i) strategic group project costs (including costs related to our initial public offering, our finance
transformation and IT projects) and (ii) restructuring, severance and other expenses.

We had no significant expenses for strategic group projects in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 or the year ended December 31, 2022. Strategic
group project costs amounted to €21.3 million in 2021 and €13.0 million in 2020. Strategic project costs consist of costs associated with strategic projects
as part of our wider business transformation program, including our initial public offering in 2021, and include costs relating to our group-wide enterprise
resource planning system and other significant IT implementation programs. These costs were considered not to meet our policy for capitalization of
software development costs in accordance with IAS 38. In 2021, strategic project costs related to our initial public offering. In 2020, strategic project
costs included €7.4 million of costs incurred in preparation for a potential change in our capital structure. Costs of strategic IT projects included
€5.5 million incurred in 2020 in connection with, among other things, the implementation of the ERP system.

We had no significant expenses for restructuring resulting from acquisitions, significant relocation and internal reorganization in the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 or the year ended December 31, 2022. Expenses for restructuring resulting from acquisitions, significant relocation and internal
reorganization programs amounted to €1.5 million in 2021 and €4.1 million in 2020. In 2021, these expenses related to costs associated with our ongoing
merger and acquisition activity. In 2020, these expenses consisted primarily of costs relating to various restructuring projects, including a major
restructuring project in Switzerland.

(b) For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, transaction costs for acquisition projects that we completed or abandoned amounted to €12.5 million
and included €13.1 million of legal and consulting expenses and €0.6 million in release of provisions for earn-outs relating to previous acquisitions. For
2022, transaction costs for acquisition projects that we completed or abandoned amounted to €6.9 million and included €11.0 million of legal and
consulting expenses and €4.1 million in release of provisions for earn-outs relating to previous acquisitions. For 2021, transaction costs for acquisition
projects that we completed or abandoned amounted to €7.1 million and included €4.0 million of legal and consulting expenses and €3.1 million in
additional earn-outs relating to previous acquisitions that exceeded provision amounts as our significant growth resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic
impacted earn-out agreements. For 2020, transaction costs for acquisition projects that we completed or abandoned amounted to €1.9 million and
included €2.7 million of legal and consulting expenses and €0.8 million in release of provisions for earn-outs relating to previous acquisitions.

(c) Impairment of non-current assets in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to amortization of software that had become obsolete.
Impairment of non-current assets in 2022 related to a €213.0 million impairment of goodwill relating to our German business principally as a
consequence of the impact of the overall geopolitical situation on our German business, specifically the rise in the yield of the 30-year German
government bond that increased our weighted average cost of capital and the high inflationary environment that weakened our business outlook in
Germany. There were no impairments of non-current assets in 2021. Impairment of non-current assets in 2020 primarily related to an impairment of
goodwill for our operations in Switzerland in an amount of €115.0 million due to commercial challenges in Switzerland (which was at the time included
in our South segment).

(d) Amortization of customer relationships relates to customer relationships recognized as part of the purchase price allocation for the acquisitions that we
completed.


-----

(e) Operating depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of property, plant and equipment, depreciation of right-of-use assets and amortization of
other intangible assets. For purposes of calculating our Adjusted EBITDA, operating depreciation and amortization is calculated by eliminating
amortization of customer relationships from the depreciation and amortization line item in our income statement.

(f) Covenant adjustments reflect certain adjustments that are permitted under our financing agreements for the purposes of covenant calculations, including
(i) the inclusion of pre-acquisition results from pre-acquisition financial information for acquisitions that were completed during the year ended
December 31, 2022 and the exclusion of pre-disposal results from our consolidated financial information for disposals during the year ended
December 31, 2022, amounting to a net €0.2 million add-back to Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023; (ii) synergies
achieved on acquisitions completed in the preceding 24 months, amounting to €1.8 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023;
(iii) extraordinary items, which, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, reflected a €20.0 million one-off legal provision set aside in December
2022 relating to an ongoing competition law investigation in Portugal for which settlement discussions are continuing and our management believes the
amount of the provision is conservative; (iv) share-based payment expenses related to long-term equity incentive plan rewards made as a publicly listed
company that will not occur under private ownership following the Acquisition, amounting to €6.2 million for the twelve months ended September 30,
2023; and (v) start-up losses incurred in our newly launched "Health for You" B2C business (mainly relating to payroll and consultancy costs), amounting
to €5.7 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023.

(g) Management adjustments reflect (i) severance costs paid in relation to duplicate positions arising from M&A and restructurings, amounting to
€2.7 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023; (ii) the elimination of net compensation amounting to €(2.6) million for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2023 relating to subsidies received from our landlord in connection with an upcoming premises move in Germany, which
subsidies were recorded in operating income; (iii) adjustments to non-recurring defined benefit pensions costs amounting to €(1.2) million for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2023; and (iv) certain one-off items impacting Adjusted EBITDA in certain of our segments amounting to €(0.2) million,
€2.5 million and €(7.4) million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 in our France, Germany and North & East segments, respectively.

(h) _Pro forma adjustments reflect (i) certain costs incurred as a publicly listed company that are not expected to be incurred under private ownership, such_
as supervisory board fees and annual general meeting expenses as well as certain investor relations costs, rating agency fees and a portion of legal fees,
amounting to €2.5 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023; (ii) the inclusion of pre-acquisition financial information for acquisitions
that were completed during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, amounting to €4.6 million for that nine-month period and the corresponding
twelve months ended September 30, 2023; (iii) the removal of pre-disposal Adjusted EBITDA for our business in Switzerland, the sale of which
completed in July 2023, amounting to €(3.8) million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023; (iv) the removal of pre-disposal Adjusted
EBITDA for our veterinary diagnostics business in Belgium, Germany and Spain, the sale of which completed in September 2023, amounting to
€(5.6) million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023; and (v) the sale of our businesses in Ukraine and Poland, which completed in August
2023, the impact of which amounted to €0.4 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, as the pre-disposal EBITDA for these business
was negative.

(i) Illustrative run-rate adjustments reflect (i) the full-period impact of SALIX savings from initiatives implemented in 2023, as initiatives are typically
implemented part-way through the year, amounting to €8.0 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023; (ii) expected productivity
improvement in the year ending December 31, 2024, primarily resulting from the reduction of headcount of personnel dedicated to COVID-19-related
testing, amounting to €7.6 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023; and (iii) the margin improvement expected in the long term for our
Synnovis partnership agreement with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in South East
London as the contract matures and cost savings are delivered through the migration of services from legacy hospital systems to our central laboratories,
amounting to €9.1 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023.

(j) Given the decline and normalization of COVID-19-related EBITDA, Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA reflects an adjustment to reduce COVID19-related EBITDA in each period to the level at which it is expected going forward. The adjustment amounts to €(16.8) million for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2023.

(3) We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the applicable period.

property, plant and equipment. We define Unlevered Free Cash Flow as cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations,
adjusted for Net Capex and lease repayments and interest expenses on leases as shown in the following table. Unlevered Free Cash Flow
is further adjusted to exclude net interest to determine Free Cash Flow.

(7) Organic growth between one accounting period ("period n") and the prior comparative accounting period ("period n-1") is determined as
follows:

   - organic growth for acquisitions that took place during period n-1 is calculated by comparing (x) revenue in period n with
(y) revenue in period n-1 adjusted for the effects of acquisitions (i.e., by adding back revenue from the acquisitions made during
period n-1 prior to the date on which the relevant operations were added to the scope of consolidation). The full-year contribution
from the acquisitions made during period n-1 consists of the estimate of revenue recognized by the newly acquired companies prior
to the date on which they were added to the perimeter of consolidation;

   - organic growth for acquisitions that took place during period n is calculated by subtracting revenue generated by the businesses
acquired between the date on which they joined the perimeter of consolidation and the end of period n;

   - organic growth for disposals that took place during period n is calculated by subtracting revenue generated by the businesses
disposed of between the start of period n-1 and the date on which they exited the perimeter of consolidation; and

   - the percentage of organic growth is then calculated as the ratio of (x) revenue in period n restated for the acquisitions completed
during period n divided by (y) revenue in period n-1 adjusted for the impact of the acquisitions completed during period n-1.

Organic growth is a non-IFRS measure calculating the growth in revenue for a given period compared to the comparable period of the
prior year for the same scope of businesses, excluding discontinued operations, and in constant currency (i.e., using the exchange rates of
the prior year reported period. When calculating organic growth, we use the scope of businesses that have been consolidated in our


-----

financial statement of the previous financial year. Revenue contribution from businesses acquired in the course of the prior year but not
consolidated for the full year are adjusted as if they had been consolidated as from January of the prior year. All revenue from businesses
acquired since January 1 of the current year are excluded from the calculation.

_______________
(1) Net financial debt represents external interest-bearing loans and borrowing less cash and cash equivalents. Adjusted to give pro forma
effect to the Offering as if it had occurred on September 30, 2023. In the event that the number of Target shares held by the Bidder does
not meet the Squeeze-Out Threshold, the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B is expected to be repaid in part or in full using cash on the
Target's balance sheet, proceeds of the Offering and/or borrowings under the New Term Loan B that are not required to be utilized for
purposes of acquiring shares of the Target, in which case as adjusted net financial debt will be reduced by an amount corresponding to
the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B repayment, as partially offset by additional cash that may be utilized for purposes of acquiring shares
of the Target or for such debt repayment. See "Capitalization."

(2) Net senior secured debt represents Indebtedness of the Group included in the definition of Consolidated Total Leverage that constitutes

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below before_
_deciding to invest in the Notes. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information in_
_this Offering Memorandum, including the Financial Statements and related notes. These risks and_
_uncertainties are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known_
_to us or that we currently consider immaterial could have a material adverse effect on our business, results_
_of operations and financial condition and our ability to make payments on the Notes._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties._
_Our actual results may differ materially from those included in these forward-looking statements as a result_
_of various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

**Risks Related to Our Industry**

**_We operate in a highly regulated sector. Compliance with regulations applicable to our activities may_**
**_increase operating costs or restrict activities and failure to comply with such regulations may lead to_**
**_penalties of various types._**

The medical diagnostics industry (including clinical laboratory testing) is subject to extensive regulations
and controls by various regulatory authorities in each of the countries in which we operate. Those
regulations and controls have a significant influence on the way we carry out activities.

For clinical laboratories, those regulations mainly pertain to operating requirements, professional
qualifications of laboratory personnel, ownership and corporate governance constraints on companies that
operate laboratories, and the pricing and reimbursement levels of clinical tests. Our activities are also
subject to numerous other laws and regulations, particularly as regards the handling and storing of certain
chemicals and reagents, the disposal of biological waste (i.e., waste from activities that carry a risk of
infection), the handling and storage of personal data (including patients' medical records and test results),
relationships with doctors and hospitals (including laws and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and
regulating gifts and fringe benefits) and the prevention of fraud to social security systems. Compliance with
such regulations is closely monitored by the relevant administrative authorities in the countries and regions
in which we operate, as well as by the competent professional associations.

Compliance with current or future laws and regulations entails significant costs and any regulatory
developments may cause an increase in our administrative, legal and operational expenditure, forcing us to
alter our commercial practices, legal organization, ownership structure and corporate governance of
subsidiaries or, more generally, reduce or limit our revenue. Failure to comply with such regulations may
also lead to sanctions of various kinds for us and potentially for laboratory doctors working for us. Sanctions
may be administrative (e.g., fines, periodic penalty payments, temporary or permanent closures of
laboratories), disciplinary (e.g., temporary or permanent removal of the right to practice), civil (e.g.,
damages), or criminal (e.g., a ban on operating a clinical laboratory or imprisonment).

If we fail to comply with applicable regulations, if they change or are interpreted in a manner adverse to us
or if we cannot maintain, renew or secure required permits, licenses, accreditations, agreements or other
necessary administrative authorizations, we may be unable to pursue activities or market our services in the
relevant jurisdictions, be excluded from participating in public healthcare programs, no longer be able to
enter into contracts with third-party payers, suffer penalties or civil and criminal fines, or be subject to
complaints by third parties, with the financial consequences that may result. If we cannot respond
effectively to regulatory and market changes, our outlook and results of operations could be adversely
affected.

These laws and regulations, the extent of some of which have not been fully interpreted by courts, may
require us to modify our operations or impose additional compliance expenses or burdens or give rise to
administrative fines and penalties. For example, French regulatory reforms imposing stricter International
Organization for Standardization ("ISO") operating standards (namely ISO 15189) and introducing
minimum accreditation standards for laboratories, have resulted in a costly and time-consuming
implementation process. The laboratory accreditation process involves the preparation of written
applications, site studies and assessment of the scope of changes required to comply with new standards,
the appointment of external qualified experts, the training of our staff, the participation of our staff in the
process in addition to their usual workload, the payment of certain administrative fees and the


-----

implementation of new quality software. Accreditation may be delayed based on many factors, including
the number of sites operated by a medical laboratory and the responsiveness of the accreditation body,
COFRAC (Comité français d'accréditation). Although we have already undertaken to conduct our business
in compliance with these heightened standards, any further changes in laws and regulations may require us
to further modify our operations.

Changes affecting certain regulations or government programs that are not directly connected with the
medical diagnostics sector, for example, relating to prescription control, co-payment, doctors, health
insurers and hospitals, may also affect us and impair our results of operations and ability to expand our
activities.

In all of the aforementioned cases, our reputation could be damaged and important relationships with
government regulators, or third parties could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_The prices we may charge in certain markets are set by government-enforced rates that are often_**
**_decreasing._**

In many countries, our activities are subject to regulated rates (particularly for clinical services) because
our services are provided under public health programs funded partly or entirely by governments. As a
result, most of the clinical testing services we provide are subject to prices or required rate-determination
methods that are generally set by governmental authorities and we have only limited influence on them.
Rates may be revised at any time and past revisions have involved reductions in rates. Tariff decreases may
reduce our margins and may adversely affect revenue from testing services and results of operations or even
the feasibility of providing certain testing services by some or all of our laboratories. Further tariff decreases
in the countries in which we operate are possible and any such decreases could be significant.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, nearly all of our revenue from human medicine in our core market
countries of France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom was generated from services for which prices
are directly or indirectly regulated by governmental authorities. Tariffs or volume quotas are often
established by or negotiated with governments and other authorities or regulatory bodies, and we have
limited or no influence over the levels at which they are set.

Governments typically control healthcare expenditure by reducing rates or reimbursement levels, seeking
to reduce the number of tests prescribed by doctors and limiting the testing services covered by their health,
welfare or social security programs. Government reimbursement schemes often limit the range of tests that
are covered and certain pre-existing or innovative tests that provide higher margins to us may be excluded
from such coverage.

In countries where prices are not currently regulated, government price containment measures may impact
our activities, since the public healthcare system covers most of the population. In general, we expect
increased constraints on government-regulated tariffs to continue. In recent years, many European
governments have announced or undertaken measures aimed at curbing spending, including healthcare
expenditures, and may institute further policies designed to lower healthcare expenditures. As a result of
such policies, changes in medical guidelines could lead to lower volumes of recurring tests, which could
have a negative impact on our business. For example, the French government encourages healthcare
professionals to limit the number of tests prescribed.

Furthermore, governments tend to reduce in greater proportion tariff levels on tests that are administered in
high volumes, which has a multiplying effect on our results as the tests performed in high volumes tend to
be impacted by larger tariff cuts, and we may not be able to offset the impact of lower tariff levels by
increasing testing volumes accordingly. Policies that limit or decrease the amounts we may charge for our
services or exclude coverage of certain of our services from public health programs could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We face efforts by non-governmental third-party payers—mainly private health insurers—to reduce_**
**_utilization and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing services._**

In certain markets, we receive payment for our services from private health insurers that have gained
significant bargaining power by only reimbursing healthcare services if such services are provided by
preselected providers. Furthermore, in certain markets, private health insurers directly negotiate fee


-----

structures with healthcare providers, including clinical laboratories. Certain private health insurers have
insisted on discounted fee structures as a condition for preselection in the past and may insist on further
discounted fee structures in the future. If we are not preselected by private health insurers or are required
to accept unfavorable terms to secure such preselection, our revenue and results of operations may be
adversely affected.

Private health insurers have also exerted pricing pressure on hospitals which, in turn, have exerted pricing
pressure on us. Such pricing pressure on hospitals and other parties with which we conduct business reduces
such parties' margins and may cause such parties to default on their obligations to us.

In certain markets where private insurance supplements public healthcare, private health insurers may seek
to control their costs by reducing levels of reimbursement under their insurance plans, requiring the patient
to pay any shortfall or an increased amount of shortfall. Such efforts by third-party payers to reduce the
utilization of clinical laboratory testing services, or their exposure to risks associated with such utilization,
and reimbursement levels on the services we provide, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

Future economic downturns may lead governments, public health authorities, private health insurers and
patients to further reduce their expenditures on healthcare. Where patients are directly or indirectly
responsible for all or part of the cost of laboratory tests, individual decisions to reduce healthcare
expenditures may result in a reduction in demand for our services. A decrease in household disposable
income, or the perception thereof, in times of economic downturn can lead to a reduction in individuals'
healthcare expenditures. This may result in patients postponing certain types of medical treatment and could
result in a significant decrease in our test volumes and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Weak economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our activities._**

Economic downturns and volatility, including as a result or an escalation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine
or the recent escalation of conflict in the Middle East and the associated effects on the global economy
including material increases in global inflation, energy prices and interest rates since early 2022 which have
also had profound effects in 2023, increases our risks associated with conducting activities. Such risks
include the risk of default by customers on their payment obligations to us. Economic difficulties also result
in reduced levels of activities and higher unemployment and can cause governments, private health insurers
and other third parties to reduce their healthcare spending, which may affect our revenue or margins. Our
customers include large companies to which we provide clinical laboratory testing services for their
employees. However, economic conditions in those countries have led and might continue to lead to
bankruptcies, headcount reductions, hiring freezes and financial difficulties for certain of our corporate
customers, prompting them to reduce testing services volumes.

In addition to volume reductions or payment defaults, an economic downturn may result in downward
pressure on prices and therefore on margins. Where patients, directly or indirectly (such as through private
health insurance premiums) are responsible for all or part of the cost of medical tests, individual decisions
to reduce healthcare expenditures may result in a reduction of demand for our services. More generally, a
decrease in household disposable incomes, or merely the perception thereof, in times of economic downturn
can lead to a reduction in individuals' healthcare expenditure, including private insurance coverage and the
level of such coverage, regardless of the level of reimbursement by public social security systems. Any
such reduction in our services could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations and financial
condition.

**_Inflation has adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our material, personnel and_**
**_operating expenses._**

Inflationary factors such as increases in labor costs, material costs and overhead costs have adversely
affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our material, personnel and operating expenses. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, our overall Group costs were 3.4% higher as a result of the impact
of inflations, including impacts of 2.3%, 3.8% and 3.7% for our material, personnel and operating expenses,
respectively, during the period. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our overall Group costs were 3.1%
higher as a result of the impact of inflations, including impacts of 1.8%, 2.7% and 6.0% for our material,
personnel and operating expenses, respectively, during the period.


-----

Inflationary pressures may also increase other costs related to our business. For example, material increases
in global inflation will impact how regulators view prices and may affect the 2% growth assumption in our
main markets. As a result, we may not be able to fully recover increased costs due to inflation from our
customers. Continuing or worsening inflation could significantly increase our operating expenses and
capital expenditures, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows and our ability to service our indebtedness, including the Notes.

**_Increased quality and price competition could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and_**
**_profitability._**

The medical diagnostics market, including clinical testing services, is intensely competitive. In markets
where fee structures are regulated, accounting for approximately half of our revenue, competition is based
mostly on the quality of services provided. Reputation in the medical community is a key factor affecting
the volume of testing services we provide in such markets, since healthcare professionals are an important
source of patient referrals to our laboratories. In other market segments not subject to regulatory pricing,
we also compete on the basis of price. Such services include, in particular, testing services pursuant to
hospital outsourcing agreements and testing paid out-of-pocket by customers in certain countries.

Our main competitors, some of whom are also clients, include large multinational companies, national
companies in certain countries and numerous small local companies. Pricing is also a key driver in
outsourcing decisions of hospital laboratories, for which the main objective is cost reduction. We may not
be able to offer services similar to, or more desirable than those of our competitors or at a price comparable
to that of our competitors in all segments where prices are freely negotiated.

In addition, we face competition from both public and private diagnostic service providers based on their
areas of scientific and advanced expertise, the geographical footprint of their networks, their ability to
process samples and report data accurately and in a timely manner, their historical experience and customer
relationships and the quality of their facilities. Existing or new competitors could develop close
relationships with our hospital and medical professional customers in our markets and compete for referrals,
which could have a direct impact on business, either through market share losses or price reductions.

The ongoing consolidation of the European clinical laboratory industry is expected to enable larger groups
to offer lower prices as they adopt large-scale automated testing allowing them to reduce their costs. The
resulting testing procedures are particularly likely to induce increased cost reductions. As a result of the
size and structure of our network, we may be unable to achieve competitive levels of efficiency and may
lose customers or tenders as a result.

In some markets, scale and geographic reach provide competitive advantages because private health
insurers prefer negotiating national contracts with networks that have a substantial geographic footprint and
offer them more favorable terms. Our ability to compete effectively may be adversely affected if we do not
have an extensive enough network in some of the markets in which we operate, as compared to competitors
with greater financial resources, stronger market positions or broader geographical reach.

If we are unable to successfully compete, this will adversely affect our revenue, results of operations and
financial condition.

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_We face risks associated with our strategy of acquiring companies._**

Our growth strategy includes acquiring small- and medium-sized laboratories and integrating them into our
network. The continued success of our strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify suitable acquisition
targets, conduct appropriate due diligence, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, complete such
transactions and integrate the acquired businesses into our business.

Continued consolidation of the European medical diagnostics market, including clinical laboratory testing
services, or adverse macroeconomic conditions may limit opportunities for further acquisitions. Our
acquisition strategy is also exposed to competitive pressures from competitors with similar acquisition
strategies or certain financial investors wishing to enter the market, either of which may have greater
financial resources than us.


-----

Furthermore, acquisitions involve the integration of a company that previously operated independently with
systems and processes that differ from those used by us. We may not be able to integrate certain acquired
companies successfully or the integration may require more time and investment than expected.
Additionally, we could bear or assume unknown or unexpected liabilities or risks related to customers,
employees, suppliers, competent administrative authorities, professional associations, public health
programs, private health insurers or other persons.

If we are unable to implement our acquisition strategy or integrate acquired companies successfully, it could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We may be unable to successfully manage and integrate acquisitions or achieve anticipated synergies_**
**_and cost saving adjustments._**

Our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and achieve anticipated synergies is dependent upon a
significant number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control. If one or more of the underlying
assumptions proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to substantially higher costs than
planned and we may not be able to fully achieve, or achieve in the anticipated timeframe, any benefits from
executed acquisitions.

Generally, when we acquire businesses, we identify anticipated synergies that are expected to materialize
after the combination of the acquired business with us. Achieving synergies can be difficult and uncertain,
and the process of integrating acquired businesses involves risks. These risks include, but are not limited
to:

   - diversion of management's time and attention from daily operations to the integration of newly
acquired operations;

   - difficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures, practices and sales and
distribution methodologies;

   - difficulties in conforming the acquired company's accounting system, books and records,
internal accounting controls, and procedures and policies to those we use;

   - retaining the loyalty and business of the customers of acquired businesses;

   - retaining employees who may be vital to the integration of the acquired business or to the
future prospects of the combined businesses;

   - difficulties and unanticipated expenses related to the integration and standardization of
information technology systems, especially financial reporting and accounting systems;

   - difficulties in maintaining timeliness and quality of service;

   - difficulties in complying with different regulatory environments;

   - unforeseen challenges of operating in new geographic areas; and

   - unanticipated costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities.

Failure to successfully transfer business operations and otherwise integrate acquired businesses may result
in reduced levels of revenue, operating efficiency or profitability compared to what we historically achieved
or might have achieved if we had not acquired such businesses, as well as the loss of customers of the
acquired businesses. In addition, we may not be able to realize the potential savings identified in our pro
_forma adjustments as a consequence of the Target's delisting form the Frankfurt Stock Exchange._

**_We have recognized a significant amount of goodwill and may never realize the full value of that_**
**_goodwill._**

We have recognized a significant amount of goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs
over the fair value of the net assets of companies acquired. Our goodwill amounted to €2,268.5 million as
of September 30, 2023, equal to 45.5% of our total assets. Under IFRS, goodwill is not amortized but is
tested for impairment annually and whenever there is any indication of impairment. Impairment may result


-----

from, among other things, a deterioration in our performance, a decline in expected future cash flows,
adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations (including changes that
restrict the activities of, or affect the services provided by, our laboratories) and various other factors. For
example, in 2022 we recorded a €213.0 million impairment of goodwill relating to our German business
principally as a consequence of the impact of the overall geopolitical situation on our German business,
specifically the rise in the yield of the 30-year German government bond that increased our weighted
average cost of capital and the high inflationary environment that weakened our business outlook in
Germany.

The amount of any impairment must be reported immediately as a charge to our income statement and
cannot be reversed. Any future goodwill impairments can materially adversely affect our results of
operation.

**_We depend on market perceptions, particularly with respect to the safety, effectiveness and quality of our_**
**_testing._**

Market and customer perceptions are important to our business, especially perceptions with respect to the
safety and quality of our tests. If any tests administered or distributed by us are subject to a drop-in quality
or timeliness or prove to be, or are accused of being, harmful to customers or inaccurate, this could
adversely impact demand for our products. Negative publicity with respect to the quality of our tests could
have the same effect.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we became highly visible in the media. High visibility in the media could
expose us to increased public scrutiny and shifts in public opinion, influenced by, among other things, any
perception that providers of clinical laboratory and medical diagnostics services have improperly
capitalized on the COVID-19 pandemic for financial gain, delays from SARS-CoV-2 or other test backlogs
in laboratories due to extreme demand, perception of false positive/negative results due to human errors or
limitations in current testing technology, loss of samples, data privacy breaches or reporting errors.

Negative changes of market perceptions with respect to our services could negatively affect our
relationships with national authorities, prohibit future service contracts with public or private clients or
impact demand for our services. This can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
cash flows, results of operations and prospects.

**_A portion of our business is dependent on large customer contracts, often with public or private_**
**_insurance companies or hospitals. If we were to lose one or more key customers, or if the contracts with_**
**_these customers are renewed at reduced prices, our revenue could be affected._**

The success of our business depends, in part, on large customer contracts entered into with private insurance
companies, local or regional health care providers or hospital chains and on our group-wide pan-European
framework supply agreements for reagents. For example, in November 2020, we entered into a partnership
agreement, valued at £1,865 million over 15 years, with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and
King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust to become the London Trusts' new pathology partner and
transform and deliver pathology services across South East London. Other large contracts may be longterm contracts with terms of up to five years. We may not be able to renew or extend contracts on favorable
terms and we may lose significant business to competitors at upcoming expiries. While no individual
customer contract is material to our revenue generation, failure to maintain or establish new contracts may
negatively impact our growth strategy, geographic footprint and future prospects.

If we are unable to comply with quality requirements, legal and regulatory requirements or the required
service level related to any contract, there could be a risk that we would lose such a contract and the related
revenue and profits. The loss of contracts or renewal of contracts at less favorable terms could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We may be unable to retain or recruit experienced laboratory doctors, which may weaken our_**
**_relationships with local medical communities and adversely impact our results of operations._**

The success of our clinical laboratories depends on employing and retaining qualified, skilled and
experienced laboratory doctors who can maintain and enhance our reputation by providing testing services
in accordance with our standards. If competition for the services of these professionals were to increase in
the future, (i) we may not be able to continue to attract and retain such laboratory doctors, which could


-----

make it more difficult to comply with licensing requirements, or (ii) we may only be able to retain medical
talent at higher costs, adversely impacting our profitability and financial condition.

Our business depends partly on personal relationships and the professional reputation of laboratory doctors
with patients and with the customers that refer patients to our laboratories, such as general practitioners and
private hospitals. Departing laboratory doctors who have close relationships with their local medical
community may draw some business away from us. If we lose, or fail to attract and retain, qualified
laboratory doctors who have positive relationships with their respective local medical communities, it could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_If we lose the services of members of the senior management team, our activities and results of operations_**
**_may be adversely affected._**

The execution of our strategy and our continued success depends in part on the continued skills, efforts and
motivation of our senior management team, both at a corporate level and in each of the countries in which
we operate. Our strategy for organic growth and improved operating efficiency depends particularly on
senior management having deep knowledge of our activities. Our external growth strategy requires
knowledge of the dynamics, major players and regulatory environment in the various markets in which we
operate. The departure of key senior management members or of experienced personnel may disrupt the
pursuit of our strategy. If one or more members of the senior management team or experienced personnel
were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, including for health, family or other personal
reasons, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner or at all. An inability to attract and retain
qualified members or key personnel in due time could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

**_Failure to comply with and establish appropriate quality standards as part of our testing services may_**
**_adversely impact our reputation and results of operations._**

Our clinical testing services are intended to supply healthcare professionals with information to help them
establish or support diagnoses and prescribe medical or other treatment for their patients. Inaccuracies or
negligence in providing clinical testing services may lead to inaccurate diagnoses by healthcare
professionals, prescriptions of inappropriate treatments or decisions not to prescribe treatment when
treatment is required, which may have serious consequences for patients (including illness, harm, death or
other adverse effects).

Errors such as misidentifying or inaccurately labeling samples or compromising the integrity of samples,
as well as errors caused by testing machines or reagents used for testing, may occur. Claims and litigation
against us may result in liability for the harm or other adverse effects caused. We have been the subject of
legal proceedings for alleged acts or omissions of our laboratory personnel and other employees in the past.
If we are involved in such proceedings in the future, even if we are successful in our defense, the
proceedings could be costly, could distract management from executing our strategy and could result in
substantial damage to our reputation in the medical community and with patients. Payments related to such
liabilities may adversely affect our liquidity and financial position. Failure to comply with and establish
appropriate quality standards as part of our testing services may adversely impact our reputation and results
of operations.

**_Business interruption at one of our laboratory facilities could result in significant losses and reputational_**
**_damage to our business._**

We operate a large number of laboratory sites. These larger or strategically important laboratory sites are
critical to our operations in certain regional or national markets. There is a risk of business interruption at
these sites, which could be the result of external factors such as lack of testing supplies, natural disasters,
fire, vandalism, cyberattacks or other unforeseen events. Business interruption could also be the result of
internal factors such as failure to comply with regulatory requirements and the resulting loss of
authorizations to operate the facility. While our key laboratories remained open and operational during the
COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot rule out the possibility that future events that have a similar or comparable
impact on operations such as ours could result in closures of our laboratories or other facilities.

Business interruptions could have a significant adverse impact on our business, both from direct losses of
revenue and profits related to the affected laboratory site and through the reputational damage that such a
business interruption could have on our business. While we maintain business interruption insurance for


-----

most of our major locations, there can be no assurance that it would adequately offset our losses in the event
of a business interruption. Business interruptions could therefore have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Financial difficulties of a customer or third-party payer may result in payment delays or require us to_**
**_write off debts._**

We encounter third-party credit risk where we are reliant on the ability of a third party to be able to pay for
services it provides. We are exposed to varying levels of third-party credit risk across our lines of business
depending upon the country in which we provide the service and its specific health scheme.

In certain countries we bill patients directly for the majority of our services, in others we invoice the public
healthcare system and in others we invoice private or public hospitals directly for the majority of services
performed. Collection efforts for amounts due can be difficult, especially from patients in countries where
there is no primary government payer of healthcare expenses. If a third-party payer or a company with
which we have a contractual relationship experiences financial difficulties, we may be unable to collect
amounts payable to us, resulting in write-offs of such debt. We maintain reserves for doubtful accounts and
amounts past due. However, there can be no assurances that such reserves will be sufficient for the thirdparty credit risks we face. Significant or recurring delays in receiving payment, or incidents of bad debts,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Failure to bill quickly or accurately for our services may have a material adverse effect on our activities._**

We send invoices for our services to, among others, patients, insurance companies, social security
organizations, medical doctors, hospitals or employers. Depending on the billing arrangement and the
applicable regulation of the country in which we operate, the payer may be a third party responsible for
providing health insurance coverage to patients (such as public health insurance provider or a private
medical insurance plan), a patient or other party (such as a hospital, clinic or an employer) who outsourced
testing to us, or a combination of these parties. Changes in laws and regulations, contractual terms agreed
with payers or payment policies of payers may increase the complexity and cost of our billing process.
Additionally, checking compliance with applicable regulations as well as internal compliance policies and
procedures further increases the costs and complexity of the billing process.

In general, failure to bill timely or accurately for our services or increased complexity in billing
arrangements and procedures may result in penalties, foregone revenue (i.e., no reimbursement or payment
for tests already processed), delayed payments and/or an increase in our working capital requirements, any
of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Disruption, failure or inappropriate sample transportation services may adversely affect our activities_**
**_and financial results._**

The proper handling of samples during collection and transportation is essential for maintaining their
integrity, ensuring the quality of tests and guaranteeing safety from accidental exposure to potentially
infectious microorganisms. The vehicles used to transport samples must satisfy applicable legal, practical
and technical requirements, which vary depending on the type of samples transported. These requirements
govern, for example, the use of appropriate containers and packaging, the labeling of containers, the manner
in which samples and containers are stored in the vehicle, the temperature at which samples must be
transported and the duration of the journey. Drivers employed to transport samples must be trained to handle
them in accordance with best practice and applicable laws and regulations. Mishandling of the sample in
the collection and transportation process may increase the likelihood of errors in laboratory testing. In
addition, efficient transportation of samples is key to our business. Our business operates on a model of
numerous satellite and emergency laboratory sites and blood collection points where samples are collected
and, if testing is not conducted on site at the local laboratory, it is delivered to our European reference
laboratories or national hub or regional laboratory sites where testing takes place. Disruption to the
collection and transportation of samples, failure to comply with requirements relating to samples or the
inadequate performance of the transportation service may damage our reputation, lead to claims against us
and/or result in the loss of customers and patients, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, in certain of the countries in which we operate, we have entered into outsourcing arrangements
with third parties for the transportation of medical samples from specified sampling points (such as hospital


-----

sites or doctors' surgeries) to our clinical laboratories. We do not control the facilities or operations of such
third-party transport operators and therefore depend on the quality of their transportation services in order
to maintain the integrity of samples. Any interruption in their services, including as a result of pandemics,
strikes, inclement weather conditions or otherwise, or failure to meet their contractual obligations may
damage our reputation, lead to claims against us and/or result in the loss of customers or patients, any of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Interruptions or disruptions in our supply chain or the delivery of testing supplies could adversely affect_**
**_us._**

We depend on effective supply and distribution networks of our suppliers to obtain necessary reagents and
consumables for testing operations and for the maintenance of testing equipment. Damage or disruption to
such supply or distribution capabilities due to labor strikes at suppliers, loss on non-delivery of such
materials or any other reason beyond our control such as natural disasters, fires, explosions or accidents
could impair our ability to process tests and provide customers with their results in a timely manner, which
could damage our reputation and adversely impact our results of operations.

In particular, operations at our laboratories could be interrupted if, as a result of supply chain disruptions,
our suppliers become unable to deliver necessary personal protective equipment, reagents or other supplies
on time in the required quantity. To the extent that we are unable to effectively manage such events if they
occur or cannot financially mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, they could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Adverse results in potential material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse_**
**_impact on our client base and reputation._**

In the ordinary course of our business, we have in the past been, and may in the future continue to be,
involved in legal proceedings (including administrative, court, arbitration and disciplinary proceedings)
relating to professional liability of our laboratories, disputes with laboratory doctors, medical doctors and
employees, as well as enquiries initiated by regulatory authorities, professional associations and health
insurers, regarding, among other things, billing matters, laboratory practices and testing procedures. For
example, on December 13, 2022, the Portuguese Competition Authority ("PCA") accused the largest
medical laboratories in Portugal, including the Target and its Portuguese subsidiary, of a number of
collusive practices between 2016 and 2022 relating to the provision of clinical analysis and COVID-19
tests to both public and private healthcare providers. Although we have submitted procedural objections to
the Portuguese Court of Appeals in regard to the PCA's inspection of our premises and the seizure of
correspondences, the PCA's investigation is at its final stages and it may adopt a final decision or a
settlement may be reached by December 2023, which may result in fines on both us or our Portuguese
subsidiary. See "Business—Legal and Arbitration Proceedings."

Proceedings initiated by or against us may involve claims for material amounts and could divert
management's attention and time from day-to-day business operations to address such issues. Proceedings
may result in substantial monetary damages, adversely affect our customer base and reputation, prohibit us
for tendering for public contracts and reduce demand for our services. The final outcome of those
proceedings or claims might have an adverse impact on our financial position and any provisions set aside
in this respect may prove insufficient, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

**_Extreme weather conditions may affect our testing volume levels and, consequently, our revenue._**

The volume of tests that we complete depends in significant part on the ability of patients—who are often
ill, aged, pregnant or have limited mobility—to travel to see a doctor or to a laboratory or blood collection
point. Accordingly, unusual or inclement weather conditions, particularly those affecting ground
transportation conditions, have in the past caused, and may in the future cause, a decrease in demand for
our testing services, potentially affecting our results of operations.

**_Labor disputes or wage increases could disrupt our operations or lead to higher labor costs._**

Our employees in certain countries benefit from collective bargaining agreements and we may not be able
to periodically renegotiate collective agreements on acceptable terms. Settlement of actual or threatened
labor disputes or an increase in the number of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements may


-----

adversely affect our labor costs, productivity and flexibility. We are subject to the risk of labor disputes,
which may disrupt operations and may result in an increase in operating costs.

Increases in employee wages or the scarcity of specialized laboratory knowledge in the labor market could
also result in higher labor costs. In 2022, labor inflation increased above historic levels, with the exception
of France and Switzerland. Additionally, labor laws applicable to our business in certain countries can be
complex and leave room for interpretation. Labor law authorities or courts may have a different
interpretation than we do. In numerous cases, labor laws provide for the strong protection of employees'
interests, which we are required to observe.

Although we believe our relations with employees and unions are good, operations may nevertheless be
materially affected by strikes, work stoppages, work slowdowns or other labor-related developments in the
future, including disagreements with unions, works councils or other employee co-determination bodies,
as well as with labor law authorities. These and other similar labor-related incidents or matters could disrupt
our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

**_We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance._**

We carry insurance of various types, including business interruption, property and casualty, directors' and
officers' and general liability coverage. We maintain insurance policies both at the group level as well as
specific policies for individual laboratories that we operate through our various subsidiaries. We maintain
an amount of insurance protection that we believe is adequate, but there can be no assurances that our
insurance coverage will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all liabilities that we
may face. We could, for example, be subject to substantial claims for damages upon the occurrence of
several events within one calendar year. In addition, insurance costs may increase over time in response to
any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market
in general. We may not be able to maintain our current insurance coverage or do so at a reasonable cost.
Liabilities that are not covered by insurance or our inability to maintain current insurance coverage could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**Risks Related to Our Technology**

**_We are exposed to cybersecurity risks._**

Information technology ("IT") systems are used extensively in all aspects of our business, including clinical
testing, the management of personal data (particularly patients' medical records), electronic order entry, test
reporting, billing, customer service, logistics, finance, procurement and accounting. Our activities depend
on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our IT systems. IT problems may impact the ability to
carry out tests, deliver test results, bill for tests in due time or maintain the privacy of the medical data we
collect, all of which may disrupt our activities.

IT systems may be subject to physical or electronic attacks, computer viruses and similar disruptive
problems that may materially adversely affect our ability to function. This can be caused by events such as
ransomware attacks, theft of data or patient health information, hacking of testing equipment leading to
wrong test results, or gateway attacks into our customers' systems (e.g., general practitioners or hospitals).
We and our third-party service providers have in the past become aware of malicious directed against our
information systems Although past events have had limited impact, future events may occur, may be
material, and could result in data privacy rights infringements. We utilize AI-driven threat protection
software to neutralize threats, but we cannot entirely rule out the possibility of a successful attack in the
future. See also "—Risks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment—We generate and store
_significant volumes of personal and sensitive information and must comply with stringent privacy laws and_
_information security policies. If we fail to comply with applicable laws, we risk administrative fines and_
_additional penalties."_

In addition, IT systems are also vital from a financial and accounting point of view. Given the large number
of tests that we manage (around 600 million laboratory tests per year), an IT systems failure at one or more
of our subsidiaries could affect the reliability of our financial statements. While we have not experienced
any material cybersecurity event in the past, our competitors that have been targeted by such attacks have
experienced significant business disruptions for an extended period of time, affecting test results, patient
data, revenue and public perception. If our activities were so disrupted, it may severely disrupt business


-----

operation, adversely affect our reputation, expose us to litigation or regulatory sanctions, result in a loss of
customers and patients and/or reduce our revenue.

**_We rely on licensed technology for our services. If we are unable to license new tests and technology, or_**
**_cannot develop suitable alternatives in-house, this may materially adversely impact testing volumes and_**
**_revenue._**

If we are unable to license new tests, technology and services to expand our specialty testing activity, our
testing methods may become outdated and testing volumes and revenue may be adversely affected.

For the majority of tests, we do not develop our own tests or technologies, but rather we rely on equipment
suppliers and test developers. The clinical laboratory industry faces challenges from regularly changing
technology and new product introductions. Other companies, including our competitors, may obtain
patents, licenses or other rights that may prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to license and provide
particular tests or may increase the costs of doing so.

Additionally, demand for outsourced tests may decline. Our customers include public and private hospitals
that choose to outsource their testing, usually because they lack the expertise or the resources to conduct
the testing themselves in a cost-effective manner. Some of our customers or patients, including hospitals
and doctors, may choose to perform tests themselves that we currently perform.

Advances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective tests that can be performed
outside a commercial clinical laboratory, such as specialty tests that can be performed by hospitals in their
own laboratories, point-of-care tests that can be performed by doctors in their surgeries, or home testing
that can be performed by patients or other non-medical professionals (such as test kits that already exist for
blood sugar testing). For example, integrated genetic diagnostic testing services, offered by certain
professional websites and hardware suppliers, may also reduce activity levels for our laboratories.
Manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits may seek to increase their sales by marketing tests that
can be performed in surgeries or directly by patients.

In addition, consumer healthcare technology companies may succeed in developing novel approaches to
laboratory diagnostics testing, including alternative methods of sample collection and testing that replace
traditional methods. The development of such technology and testing methods and their use by our
customers or patients could reduce the demand for our services and negatively impact revenue.

If we are not successful in managing this risk, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_We rely on complex IT systems that may disrupt operations and cause the loss of customers or business_**
**_opportunities should they experience disruptions._**

A diverse array of software platforms are used in clinical diagnostics, and, in some cases, such platforms
are not the subject of regular updates and improvements common in other industries. In addition, many of
the software and IT providers that develop and maintain these platforms are small-and medium-sized
companies with a regional focus and limited financial resources that are inadequate to service pan-European
laboratory diagnostic providers like us. As a consequence, our IT systems may be vulnerable to and
experience difficulties or disruptions that impact our ability to operate. IT systems are vulnerable to damage
from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or other network failures, individual acts and
natural disasters.

Historically, we have grown through acquisitions, and, as a consequence, newly acquired laboratories often
use older software platforms that are not consistent with our systems. We are continuously integrating
laboratory reporting, billing and other IT systems, particularly with respect to newly acquired laboratories,
but also with respect to existing laboratories that operate with older or outdated systems and software. There
is a risk that our activities may be disrupted due to failures in our IT systems. This could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

For example, our IT infrastructure is currently being modernized, consolidated and harmonized on Group
level and centralized business processes management software is being implemented as Group standard to
ensure compliant finance, procurement and billing processes. There is no assurance that the introduction of
new systems is seamless or cost efficient. The implementation may, for example, cause our facilities to
experience service level disruptions impacting our ability to properly run business operations. Outages or


-----

a significant failure to smoothly implement such systems, disruption or cyberbreach may substantially delay
workflow processes and may have material adverse effects on our revenue and results of operations.

**Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property Rights**

**_We must protect our trademarks and those of companies that we acquire in the multiple countries in_**
**_which we operate or in countries in which we may establish operations and we face risks related to_**
**_protection and enforcement._**

Given our acquisition strategy and the importance that we place on developing a strong identity and strong
brands, we are exposed to the risk of being unable to use our trademarks in jurisdictions in which they are
not protected, for example where a competitor has made a previous application or where the local authorities
have refused to protect the trademark. Additionally, a significant portion of the value of companies that we
acquire may rest in their trademarks or other intellectual property. We must maintain a significant number
of such trademarks and protect against unauthorized use.

Many of our trademarks, including the trademark SYNLAB (word) and the SYNLAB logo hands
(figurative), have been filed with the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market of the European
Community, and are therefore protected in the 27 countries of the European Union, including our core
markets that are in the European Union, plus the United Kingdom. The trademark SYNLAB (word) and
the SYNLAB logo hands (figurative) are also registered in other countries.

While we monitor new trademark applications for identical or similar marks, we cannot be certain that steps
taken to protect our trademarks will be successful or effective, or that third parties will not infringe or make
unlawful use of our trademarks. Unauthorized use of trademarks may damage our competitive advantage
and have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**Risks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment**

**_We generate and store significant volumes of personal and sensitive information and must comply with_**
**_stringent privacy laws and information security policies. If we fail to comply with applicable laws, we_**
**_risk administrative fines and additional penalties._**

Every year, we provide millions of patients and tens of thousands of health professionals with more than
600 million laboratory test results. As a result, we receive, generate and store significant volumes of
personal and sensitive information, such as patient medical information, and are exposed to data privacy
risks resulting from, among other things, human error, IT problems and cybersecurity breaches.

We are subject to legal obligations relating to respect for, and the protection of, personal data—particularly
patients' medical records—and strict policies relating to information security. The handling of confidential
and personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to regulation and government approval in
numerous jurisdictions around the world with increasingly stringent oversight and penalties in case of
breach.

We are subject to privacy and data protection regulations with respect to the use and disclosure of protected
health information. Such regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects,
including:

   - the circumstances under which the use or disclosure of protected medical health information
is permitted or required without specific authorization by the patient;

   - a patients' rights to access, ask for amendments to and receive, protected information contained
in their medical records;

   - requirements to notify patients of privacy measures to maintain the confidentiality of protected
medical information;

   - administrative, technical and physical backups required of entities that use or receive protected
medical information; and

   - the protection of computing systems that store protected health information.


-----

For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), effective as
of May 2018, which imposes significant fines and sanctions for violations of the GDPR and is applicable
to us and to all companies processing data of EU residents. Should we breach our GDPR obligations, this
could result in the imposition of sanctions, consisting of, inter alia, civil liabilities and administrative fines.
Additionally breaches of the GDPR may lead to cease-and-desist orders from competitors as well as adverse
publicity and reputational damages, and, in exceptional cases, are subject to criminal sanctions.
Administrative fines can amount to up to €20 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover
of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, for each violation. Additional penalties may apply
under certain requirements, such as the disgorgement of profits.

If we do not adequately safeguard confidential patient data or other protected health information, or if such
information or data is wrongfully used by us or disclosed to an unauthorized person or entity, our reputation
could suffer and we could be subject to fines, penalties and administrative, legal or disciplinary proceedings
and criminal sanctions. The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Current or future regulatory changes in France, and challenges brought by the competent administrative_**
**_authorities, professional associations or professional biologists' trade unions, may affect our flexibility,_**
**_make us more dependent on laboratory doctors to check operations carried out by our French_**
**_laboratories, and call into question our organizational and legal structure._**

Our activities in France generated 19.8% of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023
and the French market is important to our growth strategy.

In France, we are subject to regulatory constraints that restrict the ownership of the share capital and voting
rights of Société d'exercice libéral ("SELs") by persons other than the laboratory doctors practicing within
such SELs. A SEL is a form of limited liability company, governed by French laws and regulations, in
which regulated liberal practitioners such as physicians (médecins) and laboratory doctors (biologistes
_médicaux) may jointly practice their professional activity._

In order to comply with these regulations, we initially established a legal structure under which we directly
and indirectly held shares representing around 99.9% of the share capital and financial rights of the SELs,
while certain laboratory doctors practicing within such SELs ("Practicing Biologists") held the remainder
of the shares, representing at least 50% of the voting rights in the shareholders meetings of the SELs in
accordance with applicable laws.

However, this allocation of share capital and financial rights can no longer be used for SELs of laboratory
doctors acquired after May 30, 2013, due to the enactment of a law that requires that more than 50% of the
share capital (in addition to 50% of the voting rights) of a SEL of laboratory doctors be held by Practicing
Biologists (the "Law of May 30, 2013"). The Law of May 30, 2013 provides an exemption for (i) SELs of
laboratory doctors created before the date the law was promulgated (i.e., May 30, 2013) (ii) that operated
under the previous share capital ownership structure on May 30, 2013, enabling them to continue having
the majority of their share capital held by companies operating laboratories (referred to as the
"grandfathering exception"). Laboratory doctors practicing in the SELs benefiting from this exemption
have a preemption right under this law in the event of a transfer of the shares issued by the SELs.

For new SELs, we have therefore adopted a new ownership and corporate governance structure that allows
us to own most of the financial rights of the SELs of laboratory doctors acquired since the law was
promulgated, or that we may acquire in the future, although we may be required to adopt more complex
legal structures than those used before the Law of May 30, 2013 came into force.

We are not required to carry out any restructuring (because of the grandfathering exception set forth by the
Law of May 30, 2013) and although the Law of May 30, 2013 is unlikely to prevent us from continuing our
development and fully consolidating acquired SELs, if we were to alter aspects of our structure in response
to regulatory changes or face a challenge to our current organizational and legal structure, we may no longer
be able to fully consolidate our French activities in our financial statements, while our ability to centrally
manage cash generated by French SELs or distribute dividends may be affected. Any new structure that we
may have to implement to comply with the challenges or new requirements outlined above may result in us
owning a smaller stake in existing SELs, and would make us more dependent on other contractual, corporate
governance and other mechanisms.


-----

As regards non-medical activities, we may have to reduce control over certain aspects of the governance of
French SELs, depending on the evolution of French laws and regulations, case law, and the interpretation
of these rules by competent authorities and courts.

The Law of May 30, 2013 may also limit our ability to sell or transfer shares in SELs of laboratory doctors
that we hold or may acquire in the future and render more complex any restructuring we might consider for
our subsidiaries. The competent administrative authorities could interpret this regime as preventing some
forms of restructuring, such as those involving a universal transfer of all assets where the acquired SEL is
not covered by the grandfathering exception. Nevertheless, such restructurings are market practice, as
confirmed by the French Competition Authority.

In addition, professional biologists' trade unions may try to challenge our operations in France or our legal
structure and organization. For example, the _Syndicat des Biologistes had introduced legal proceedings_
before the administrative court of Bordeaux that aimed at challenging an administrative decision by the
competent administrative authorities (each, an "ARS") authorizing a merger operation involving an entity
of the group. However, the claim was dismissed both in first instance and on appeal and is now definitely
closed. Similarly, a professional union of biologists summoned in March 2022 the SEL Synlab Paris and
the company Synlab France to appear before the Paris judicial court. This union seeks before the Paris
judicial court the judicial winding-up of the SEL Synlab Paris on the ground that the shareholding of this
SEL would be in breach of Article L. 6223-5. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the court
proceedings are still ongoing.

Furthermore, the Law no. 2015-990 of August 6, 2015 on growth and activity (the "Macron Law") intended
notably to modify the limitations of capital ownership and corporate governance of SELs other than clinical
laboratory SELs (i.e., SELs of technicians and lawyers). As regards clinical laboratory SELs, it added the
paragraph 6° to sub-limb B of limb I of Article 5 of Law n°90-1258 of December 31, 1990, under which
the shares of a SEL that are not held by laboratory doctors working within the SEL may be held, apart
notably from professionals practicing the same profession, by a laboratory company established in another
Member State of the European Union/EEA/Switzerland which operates, in one of these states an activity
subject to a legal or regulatory status, or is required to hold a national or international recognized
qualification, and "complies, directly or indirectly through another intermediary legal entity, with the
_requirements on holding of capital and voting rights provided by this Law" (free translation) (i.e., Law of_
December 31, 1990). It cannot be excluded that this provision may be interpreted as requiring a corporate
structure like the one developed by us, where the majority of the share capital and financial rights of the
French SELs is held through laboratory companies incorporated in a European Union Member State other
than France, to demonstrate that these laboratory companies comply with the restrictions provided by
French Law regarding the allocation of the share capital and the voting rights, for the said structure to be
valid. However, we are of the view that another interpretation should prevail, pursuant to which it could be
considered that this new provision should not apply to the SELs covered by the grandfathering exception,
as it is the case for us.

More generally, any adjustment to French regulations applicable to our SELs in the future, any adverse
interpretation of existing regulations and any introduction of new rules may affect or further limit our ability
to own or control subsidiaries in France.

In particular, the ARSs and the competent professional associations (Ordres professionnels) may challenge
the legal structure and more specifically the corporate governance arrangements of the SELs that carry out
our activities in France. Such challenge, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

For example, in 2003, the Ordre des pharmaciens initiated sanctions proceedings against certain of our
subsidiary SELs, along with certain laboratory doctors practicing within these subsidiaries, for alleged
violations of applicable regulations. These proceedings were dismissed in 2015, after a decision of the
European Commission, confirmed by the European General Court on December 10, 2014, which found that
the Ordre des pharmaciens had impeded competition on the clinical laboratory services market. We then
claimed before the Paris administrative court a compensation for the loss suffered as a result of these
practices and, in 2017, entered into a transaction protocol with the Ordre des Pharmaciens.

Similarly, the Council of State issued on 10 July 2023 three rulings in the veterinary sector in relation to
laws and regulations that are close to those applicable to SELs of biologists and physicians (the "Conseil
**d'Etat Rulings"). Although these decisions are not related to the human health sector, nor based on the**


-----

Law no. 90-1258 of December 31, 1990, on SELs (the "Law of December 31, 1990") or the French Public
Health Code, SYNLAB cannot exclude that these interpretations may be transposed by French courts,
administrative authorities or professional orders to the medical biology and pathology sectors, which may
have an adverse impact on the governance structure of the French SELs.

In addition, if the ARSs take the view that our organizational and legal structure breaches applicable
statutory or regulatory requirements, they could impose administrative sanctions, ranging from fines to the
temporary or permanent closure of the laboratory and could withdraw administrative authorizations granted
to our laboratories in France, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition. This could also give rise to disciplinary sanctions and administrative measures
(e.g., delisting) by the competent professional associations against our SELs and the medical biologists as
well as to civil remedies.

**_The French regulatory environment in which we operate is particularly stringent, especially in relation_**
**_to ownership and corporate structure of SELs (Société d'Exercice Liberal), particularly those operating_**
**_clinical laboratories. If regulators were to successfully challenge our existing legal structure, this could_**
**_have a material adverse impact on our activities._**

French regulations impose stringent restrictions on the legal structure and ownership of French companies
operating clinical laboratories.

In particular, Article L. 6223-5 of the French Public Health Code ("Article L. 6223-5") prohibits the
following persons, on the basis of their activities or shareholdings (the "prohibited investors"), from
holding, whether directly or indirectly, a fraction of the share capital of a company operating a private
French clinical laboratory (and not only SELs):

(i) a natural or legal person practicing as a healthcare practitioner (other than as laboratory doctor),
or operating as provider, distributor or manufacturer of medical devices or in vitro diagnostic
medical devices, or operating as a private healthcare institution or as a social or medico-social
institution governed by private law, or operating as an insurance or capitalization company or as
a welfare, retirement or mandatory or elective social security institution;

(ii) any natural or legal person holding 10% or more of the share capital of a company which provides,
distributes or manufactures medical devices or in vitro diagnostic medical devices, or which
operates as an insurance or capitalization company or as a welfare, retirement or mandatory or
elective social security institution; and

(iii) any natural or legal person holding, whether directly or indirectly, a fraction of the share capital
of a company of healthcare practitioners which is authorized to take samples under the conditions
mentioned under Article L. 6211-13 of the French Public Health Code and which does not meet
the conditions of chapter II of title I of book II ("Clinical testing") of part 6 of the legislative part
of the French Public Health Code (i.e., articles L. 6212-1 to L. 6212-6 of the French Public Health
Code on the qualification of a clinical laboratory).

Based on legal advice we received in the context of previous financing transactions and prior to this
Offering, our view is that "indirect shareholding" should be interpreted in light of the rules set out by Article
L. 233-4 of the French Commercial Code (according to which any capital share, even less than 10% thereof,
held by a controlled company is considered as indirectly held by the controlling company) and that,
accordingly, the penalties provided for by the relevant texts can only apply to our SELs and the concerned
prohibited investor if a prohibited investor takes control of us. In 2015, our representatives consulted the
French Ministry of Social Affairs, Health and Women's Rights, which did not put forward any different
interpretation of the related legal provisions. The Conseil d'Etat Rulings issued in July 2023 implies that
the Council of State relied on this interpretation and confirmed this interpretation to assess and define the
concept of "indirect shareholding" for the purpose of enforcing Article L. 241-17, II, 2°, of the French Rural
and Maritime Fishing Code (which set out a list of prohibited shareholders for companies of veterinarians).
As mentioned above, this precedent is not directly transposable to the medical biology sector, but we believe
that this interpretation may be logically transposed to this sector for the purpose of interpreting Article L.
6223-5 as the principles at stake are similar.

In the past, our compliance with the provisions of Article L. 6223-5 was considered in light of the fact that
certain Cinven investment funds indirectly hold a minority stake in the French SELs. The Cinven


-----

investment funds did not have legal capacity (absence de personnalité morale) and as such we concluded
that the funds could not be considered as legally "holding" the portfolio participations at stake, nor did the
Cinven investment funds or their limited partners exercise ownership rights over the share capital held in
operating companies within their portfolio (which in addition may not be in France) that may engage in
activities referred to in Article L. 6223-5. Compliance with the provisions of Article L. 6223-5 was also
considered in light of transactions involving co-investors or potential co-investors of the Cinven investment
funds that acquired, or contemplated the acquisition of, a stake in the share capital of SYNLAB.

In the context of the Offering, our view remains that "indirect shareholding" as mentioned in Article L.
6223-5 must be interpreted in light of the rules set out by the French Commercial Code and that,
accordingly, the penalties provided for by the relevant texts can only apply to our SELs and the concerned
prohibited investor if a prohibited investor were to take control of SYNLAB.

We do not believe that the Offering is prevented by the provisions of Article L. 6223-5 (and the same is
true for the below-mentioned provisions of Article R. 4113-13 of the French Public Health Code) given
that the issuance of Notes does not create any shareholding relationship between the holders of the Notes
and the Target or the SELs. If it were argued that the Offering has facilitated the Cinven Funds' majority
ownership of the share capital of the Target and, as a result, control over the Target, we cannot guarantee
that the completion of the Offering or the Acquisition would not create any regulatory risks in light of the
above-mentioned provisions of Article L. 6223-5 (and the same is true for the below-mentioned provisions
of Article R. 4113-13 of the French Public Health Code).

If our above-mentioned interpretation of the provisions of Article L. 6223-5 is not correct, our French
laboratories and any investor, natural or legal person, that qualifies as a prohibited investor, acquiring a
stake in our share capital could face a fine of up to €2 million if it is a legal entity and €500,000 if it is a
natural person. It is unclear whether such fine could be imposed for each of our SELs. This could also give
rise to disciplinary sanctions and administrative measures (e.g., delisting - _radiation) by the competent_
professional associations against our SELs and the medical biologists as well as to civil remedies.

In addition, Article R. 4113-13 of the French Public Health Code ("Article R. 4113-13") prohibits various
categories of persons from holding, whether directly or indirectly, shares representing part or all of the
share capital of SELs of doctors on the basis of their activities. This provision would be applicable to our
SELs of anatomopathology doctors. We believe that "indirect shareholding" within the meaning of Article
R. 4113-13 is to be interpreted in the same way as for Article L. 6223-5. If our interpretation were
challenged, this could give rise to disciplinary sanctions and administrative measures (e.g., delisting) by
the physicians order ("Ordre des Médecins") against our SELs of pathology doctors as well as to civil
remedies.

Any challenge to our analysis of either Article L. 6223-5 or Article R. 4113-13, which remain subject to
interpretation, or any change in these legal provisions or their application by the relevant authorities, could
have a material adverse impact on our activities in France, operating income, financial condition and
outlook, as well as on prohibited investors, which may also be subject to personal sanctions. As a result,
any of the aforementioned events may cause material disruption to our activities and could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Finally, on a prospective note, the Law of December 31, 1990 that regulates SELs in general will be
replaced as of September 1, 2024 by the Ordinance No. 2023-77 of February 8, 2023, on the corporate
practice of regulated liberal professions (the "Ordinance of February 8, 2023"). As per Ordinance of
February 8, 2023, the companies that are subject to Law of December 31, 1990 are granted one additional
year from the entry into force of the Ordinance of February 8, 2023 (i.e., until September 1, 2025) to comply
with the majority of the requirements of Ordinance of February 8, 2023. The Ordinance of February 8, 2023
does not significantly affect the substance of the statutory provisions applicable to SELs. However, the
French Parliament could decide to modify the Ordinance and the French Government needs to adopt
decrees in application of this Ordinance. The content of these decrees could affect the regulatory provisions
applicable to SELs.

**_Our business arrangements could become subject to challenge under laws and regulations that govern_**
**_our relationships with customers._**

Sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to laws and regulations
intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices in many of the jurisdictions


-----

where we conduct our business. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing,
discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business
arrangements. Because of the breadth of these laws, it is possible that some of our business arrangements
could come under scrutiny by governmental authorities or third parties in the jurisdictions where we do
business.

As part of our compliance management system, we conduct reviews of our business arrangements with
customers for compliance with applicable laws. In the course of one of these reviews, we have identified
certain past business arrangements, which we believe were then common practice in the respective market,
but which might nevertheless be challenged by the competent governmental authorities or third parties. We
have replaced or terminated all such business arrangements. We do not believe that such business
arrangements represented a material portion of our consolidated revenue and believe other operators in the
market have or had implemented similar arrangements.

Notwithstanding such measures, we cannot rule out the possibility that governmental authorities or third
parties in jurisdictions where we do business may challenge any of our past, current or future business
arrangements, which could result in administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines. In
addition to the financial impact, we could suffer significant damage to our reputation if found to be in
violation of applicable laws. In addition, as part of our compliance management system, we provide what
we believe to be appropriate training to our employees on acceptable business practices. However, this
training could fail to adequately educate sales personnel on acceptable business practices and it could also
fail to detect the actions of sales personnel who act in violation of applicable laws. We could therefore be
liable for violations of applicable laws by our employees, notwithstanding our efforts to prevent such
misconduct. If any of our business arrangements are found to violate applicable laws, this could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and reputation.

**_Failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may result in fines,_**
**_penalties and other costs as well as the loss of our licenses and authorizations, which could have a_**
**_material adverse effect on our operations._**

Our operations are subject to various licenses, authorizations and regulations under EU, national and local
laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, human health and occupational health
and safety, including those governing the handling, transportation and disposal of medical samples and
biological, infectious and hazardous waste, as well as regulations relating to the health and safety of
laboratory employees. We must meet strict requirements in all jurisdictions in which we operate for the
disposal of laboratory samples at authorized facilities.

In order to organize waste management policies, including the disposal of samples or other waste that may
qualify as waste from activities that carry a risk of infection, our companies may use services from external
providers. If those providers fail to carry out their activities in line with legal and regulatory requirements,
our companies may be held liable.

In addition, we must meet a large number of requirements relating to workplace safety for employees in
clinical laboratories, who may be exposed to various biological risks such as blood-borne pathogens
(including HIV and the hepatitis B virus). We may also become subject to claims from employees or other
persons alleging injury or illness resulting from exposure to the samples or waste they handle.

**_Our internal controls, procedures, compliance systems and risk management systems may prove to be_**
**_inadequate to prevent and discover previous or future breaches of laws and regulations and generally to_**
**_manage risks._**

Members of our governing bodies, employees, authorized representatives or agents may intentionally or
unintentionally violate applicable laws and internal standards and procedures, in particular in relation to
anti-corruption, money-laundering, antitrust and sanctions compliance as well as compliance with laws and
regulations regarding sales practices, products and services, environment, finance, employment and general
corporate and criminal law. However, there can be no certainty that our internal controls, procedures,
compliance systems and risk management systems will be able to identify such violations, ensure that they
are reported in a timely manner, evaluate them correctly or take the appropriate countermeasures, and that
they will be adequate for an enterprise of our scale and complexity.


-----

There can further be no certainty that any countermeasures we implement will be appropriate to reduce the
corresponding business risks effectively, that breaches of law, regulations or internal controls have not
occurred in the past or that their discovery would not result in significant liability or reputational damage
for us. Moreover, in light of continuously evolving legal and regulatory requirements, and internal
developments such as corporate reorganizations, there can be no certainty that our risk management
systems, internal controls and compliance systems and related governance structures will adequately
identify and address all relevant requirements.

Historically, we have grown through acquisitions, and, as a consequence, newly acquired laboratories often
use older software platforms that are not consistent with our systems. Given our resulting decentralized
operational and IT structure, it has in certain instances in the past proven challenging to implement an
effective, consistent and robust internal control framework across all geographies. See also "—Risks Related
_to Our Technology—We rely on complex IT systems that may disrupt operations and cause the loss of_
_customers or business opportunities should they experience disruptions."_

Any failure to effectively prevent, identify or address violations of our legal obligations as a result of
inadequate internal controls, procedures, compliance systems and risk management systems could result in
penalties and other sanctions, liabilities, the assertion of damages claims by third parties, and reputational
damage, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**Risks Related to Taxation**

**_We are exposed to risks related to taxation in the various countries in which we operate._**

We organize our commercial and financial activities on the basis of various and complex legal and
regulatory requirements in the various countries in which we operate, particularly with regard to taxation.
Changes in regulations or their interpretation in the various countries in which we operate could affect the
calculation of our overall tax burden (i.e., income tax, social security contributions and other taxes), along
with our financial position, liquidity and results. In addition, we must interpret national and local
regulations, international tax agreements, legal opinions and administrative practice in each of the
jurisdictions in which we operate.

We cannot guarantee that our application and interpretation of such provisions will not be challenged by
the applicable authorities. In general, any breach of tax laws or regulations applicable in the countries in
which we operate could lead to tax adjustments, late-payment interest, fines and penalties. There may also
be uncertainties associated with expected changes to tax laws, in particular following the departure of the
United Kingdom from the European Union on December 31, 2020. Additionally, we are subject to routine
tax audits by local authorities in the countries in which we operate.

If one or more of the aforementioned risks materializes, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We are exposed to risks related to VAT and French payroll tax._**

Most of our activities are exempt from VAT. We cannot recover VAT applicable to charges and expenses
relating to those VAT-exempt activities. As a result, any increase in the VAT rate on those charges and
expenses would represent additional costs for us. We would not necessarily be able to pass on this additional
cost in the prices we charge to our customers. The VAT position of our entities varies by location based on
local VAT regulations. For example, some countries have a VAT group whereas others have separate VAT
registrations. In certain locations, some of our existing or future activities are subject to VAT, which allows
us to deduct VAT levied on the related charges and expenses. If the VAT treatment of these activities were
to change, we may not be able to pass on the resulting increase in costs to our customers.

Similarly, given that most of our activities are VAT exempt, we are subject to payroll tax in France. As a
result, any change in the regulations applicable to the French payroll tax could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**Risks Related to the Acquisition**

**_The Issuer does not control the Management Board and will not control the daily business of the Target_**
**_Group until the Control Date and there can be no assurance that the Control Date will occur._**

On September 29, 2023, the Bidder published the Offer Document and by the end of the acceptance period
84.7% of the share capital and 85.6% of the voting rights of the Target had been tendered in the Offer or
held by the Sponsor or its co-investors. Despite holding a majority of the voting rights upon settlement of
the Acquisition Offer and being able to acquire additional shares of the Target, the Bidder will not control
the Target and its ability to influence the Management Board of the Target will be limited until the Control
Date. Prior to the Control Date, the Issuer has therefore no right to issue binding instructions to the
Management Board of the Target, which is required to manage the business of the Target Group under its
own responsibility and in a manner that is in the best interest of the Target Group. Consequently, prior to
the Control Date, the Management Board of the Target may elect not to (i) agree to any integration or
restructuring initiatives proposed by the Issuer or (ii) operate the business of the Target Group in the same
way that the Issuer would, which may delay or jeopardize the realization of the expected benefits of the
Acquisition or the Group's ability to achieve the strategic objectives and financial and operational targets
for the Acquisition. In addition, prior to the Control Date, the entities in the Target Group are prohibited
from providing guarantees or security with respect to the Notes.

The Issuer does not currently own the Target and the Issuer will not acquire majority ownership of the
Target until the Completion Date, subject to antitrust clearances and other conditions. Further, the Issuer
will not have full control of the Target Group's business until the Control Date occurs. We cannot assure
you that during the interim period the business of the Target will be operated in the same way the Issuer
would operate it. Any of the risks associated with the Issuer's lack of control over the Target could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.

There is no obligation, either in the Indenture or otherwise, for the Issuer to enter into a DPLTA or otherwise
to ensure that the Control Date will occur. If the Control Date does not occur, the Notes will not be
guaranteed and the Post-Completion Collateral will not be put into place.

In addition, prior to the Completion Date, the Target will not be subject to the covenants described in
"Description of the Notes." As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to such date, the Target will not take
an action that would otherwise have been prohibited had such covenants been applicable to it.

**_If the Acquisition is not completed, you may not obtain the return that you expect on the Notes._**

Upon the issue of the Notes, the Issuer will deposit or arrange to have deposited gross proceeds from the
offering into an Escrow Account to be held in escrow pending the satisfaction of certain conditions
precedent, including the completion of the Acquisition and requisite antitrust approvals. If the Acquisition
has not been consummated by the Escrow Longstop Date or, upon the occurrence of certain events, the
Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. If this occurs, you may not be able to reinvest the
proceeds from the redemption in an investment that yields comparable returns. In addition, the escrowed
funds will initially only be in the amount of the gross proceeds received from the offering of the Notes, and
will not be sufficient to pay the special mandatory redemption amount, which will include accrued and
unpaid interest up to, but not including, the special mandatory redemption date. The Sponsor is expected to
contribute to the Issuer's balance sheet or directly to the Escrow Account, any amounts necessary to, among
other things, fund the accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and additional amounts, if any, from the
Issue Date to, but excluding, the date of the special mandatory redemption. However, in the event such
commitment is not honored, the Issuer will not have sufficient funds to pay the special mandatory
redemption price, and you may not obtain the return you expect to receive on the Notes.

Although the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders, will be granted first-priority liens on the applicable
funds in the Escrow Account, the ability of holders of the Notes to realize such funds may be subject to
certain bankruptcy and insolvency law limitations in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Issuer.

If the Issuer commences a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, or one is commenced against the Issuer
while amounts remain in the Escrow Account, applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws may prevent the
Escrow Agent from releasing the escrowed funds or applying those funds for the benefit of the holders of
the Notes. The court adjudicating that case might find that the Escrow Account is the property of the


-----

bankrupt or insolvent estate. As a result, holders of the Notes may not be able to have the escrow funds
applied at the time or in the manner contemplated by the Indenture and could suffer a loss as a result.

**_The Acquisition may entitle the Target's customers and certain other business partners of the Target to_**
**_terminate their agreements as a result of change of control provisions, and may also impact our quality_**
**_and retention._**

The Acquisition may constitute a change of control under certain agreements entered into by the Target,
such as commercial agreements with some of its suppliers, and may entitle these third parties to terminate
their agreements with the us or, in some cases, request adjustments and financing arrangements of the terms
of the agreements. We cannot exclude the possibility that some of these third parties may exercise their
termination, adjustment or other rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, cash flows and results of operations following the Acquisition. In addition, some of the
third parties may use their termination or adjustment rights to renegotiate the terms of the agreements to
our detriment and may benefit from stronger bargaining power, as a result of which the Target may only be
able to secure replacement contracts on less favorable terms or at all.

Furthermore, the Acquisition itself has required, and will likely continue to require, substantial time and
focus from management, which could adversely affect management's ability to operate the business.
Likewise, employees may feel affected by the Acquisition, which could have an impact on work quality
and retention.

**_The Target's historical financial information may not be representative of our future results._**

The Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum have not been adjusted to
reflect the impact of any changes to the statement of profit or loss, statements of financial position or
statement of cash flows that might occur as a result of purchase accounting adjustments to be applied as a
result of the Acquisition. However, we will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of
accounting under IFRS 3 and will apply purchase accounting adjustments in connection with the
Acquisition to the financial statements for accounting periods subsequent to the Completion Date. The
application of purchase accounting could result in different carrying values for existing assets and liabilities
and we may add additional assets to our statement of financial position, which may include, inter _alia,_
intangible assets, such as goodwill, which are not required to be amortized in accordance with applicable
IFRS. We may also recognize different amortization and depreciation expenses. Due to these and other
potential adjustments, if we provide consolidated financial statements for periods after the Completion Date
at the level of a parent entity of the Issuer, our future financial statements could be materially different once
the adjustments are made and may not be comparable to the Financial Statements included in this Offering
Memorandum.

**_The Target may have liabilities that are not known to us or greater than anticipated._**

Before making investments, the Issuer and its shareholders conduct due diligence that they deem reasonable
and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. The objective of the
due diligence process is to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances
of an investment, to identify possible risks associated with that investment and to prepare a framework that
may be used from the date of an acquisition to drive operational achievement and value creation.
Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, the Issuer
relies on resources available to it, including information provided by the Target and, in some circumstances,
third-party investigations.

We cannot be certain that the Issuer's due diligence investigation has revealed or highlighted all relevant
facts (including fraud, bribery and other illegal activities and contingent liabilities) that may be necessary
or helpful in evaluating the merits of investing in the Target. If the due diligence investigation failed to
identify material information regarding the Target, we may later be forced to write down or write off certain
assets, significantly modify the business plan or incur impairment or other charges.

In addition, we may not be able to enforce claims with respect to the representations, warranties and
indemnity undertakings that the sellers have provided to the Issuer under the Investment Agreement.


-----

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and will depend_**
**_on cash flows from the operating companies of the Target Group to be able to make payments on the_**
**_Notes._**

As of the Issue Date and prior to the Completion Date, the Issuer will have no material assets, other than
the interest in the Escrow Account into which the proceeds of the Offering will be deposited and which will
be charged in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders, pursuant to the Escrow Account Charge.
If the Acquisition does not occur on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date or if certain other events that
trigger escrow termination occur, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption, and the
Issuer will be dependent on any cash received from the Sponsor or any third-party financing it can procure
in order to fund any shortfall in the Escrow Account, to cover the accrued interest and additional amounts,
if any, payable in connection with such special mandatory redemption and any negative interest charged on
the Escrow Account. See also "Risks Related to the Acquisition—If the Acquisition is not completed, you
_may not obtain the return that you expect on the Notes."_

Following consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will depend upon the cash flow from its operating
subsidiaries primarily in the form of repayments of a downstream proceeds loan to the Target, as well as
dividends, distributions or other payments to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes.
The amount of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash
flows of their subsidiaries and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable
law or transfer profits under profit and loss transfer agreements, if applicable. The Issuer's subsidiaries,
however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance
upstream loans to the Issuer to make payments in respect of their indebtedness, including the Notes. In
addition, such repayments, dividends and distributions may be subject to withholding and other taxes which
may lead to double taxation or other costs to the Issuer. See "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of
_the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations."_

Applicable law imposes certain restrictions upon the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries' ability to access
cash of certain of the Target's subsidiaries. The inability to transfer cash within the Group may mean that,
though the Group, in the aggregate, may have sufficient funds to meet its obligations, the Group may not
be permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity in the Group to another entity in the Group in
order to make payments to the Issuer for the purpose of meeting the Issuer's obligations under the Notes.

The subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors have no direct obligation to make payments with
respect to the Notes. While the Indenture will limit the ability of the Issuer's subsidiaries to incur consensual
restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are
subject to significant qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by
applicable law.

**_The Group's substantial leverage and debt service obligations, which may increase in the future, could_**
**_materially adversely affect its business, financial position and results of operations and preclude the_**
**_Group from satisfying its obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees._**

After completion of the Transactions, the Group will be highly leveraged and have significant debt service
obligations. As of September 30, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the
Group would have had total third-party financial indebtedness outstanding in the amount of
€2,374.0 million (including lease liabilities recognized in accordance with IFRS 16), including
€550.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes and excluding €500.0 million available for
drawing under the Group's New Revolving Credit Facility. The Group anticipates that it will continue to be
highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. See "Capitalization," "Description of Other Indebtedness" and
"Description of the Notes."

Furthermore, the Group may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the 2023 Senior
Facilities Agreement and the Indenture contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness,
these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain
circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could
be substantial and the proceeds from such indebtedness may be used, among other things, to finance
shareholder dividends reducing the Group's liquidity while increasing its leverage. The Group may also
consider investments in joint ventures or acquisitions or increased capital expenditures, which may increase


-----

its indebtedness. If new debt is added to the Group's existing debt levels, the related risks that the Group
now faces would increase. Increases in the Group's total indebtedness could also lead to a downgrade of
the ratings assigned to the Group or the Notes, which could negatively affect their trading price. Moreover,
some of the debt that the Group may incur in the future could be structurally, contractually or effectively
senior to the Notes. The Group may incur Indebtedness that shares in the Collateral or that is secured by
collateral that does not secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees. In addition, the 2023 Senior Facilities
Agreement and the Indenture do not prevent the Group from incurring obligations that do not constitute
indebtedness under those agreements.

The Group's current or future leverage could prevent it from generating sufficient cash to pay the principal,
interest or any other amounts that become due and payable under its indebtedness, including the Group's
significant leverage could have important consequences for its business and operations including, but not
limited to:

- place the Group at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with lower leverage and
better access to third-party financing sources;

- increase the costs of current and future loans;

- limit the Group's capacity to access new debt and promote necessary investment, or the Group's
ability to withstand adverse market conditions; or

- force the Group to increase its capital stock or to divest specific strategic assets to service the
Group's debts or comply with the commitments under such debts.

**_The Group is subject to restrictive covenants that limit its operating and financial flexibility._**

The Indenture and the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement contain covenants that impose significant
operating and financial restrictions on the Group. These agreements limit the Group's ability to, among
other things:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;

- make certain restricted payments and investments;

- transfer or sell assets;

- enter into transactions with affiliates;

- create or incur certain liens;

- make certain loans, investments or acquisitions;

- issue or sell share capital of certain of the Group's subsidiaries;

- create or incur restrictions on the ability of the Group's subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make
other payments to the Group;

- take certain actions that would impair the security interests in the Collateral;

- merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the Group's assets; and

- pay or redeem subordinated debt or repurchase equity.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See "Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants." The covenants to which the Group is subject could limit its ability to operate_
the Group's business, to finance future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities
and activities that may be in the Group's interest.

In addition, the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement requires the Group to comply with certain affirmative
covenants while it remains outstanding. Any future Indebtedness may include similar or other restrictive
terms. A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions under the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement could,


-----

subject to the applicable cure period, result in an event of default under the 2023 Senior Facilities
Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default that is continuing under the 2023 Senior Facilities
Agreement, the relevant creditors are entitled to cancel the availability of their commitments and/or elect
to declare all amounts outstanding under the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement, together with accrued
interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, certain defaults, events of default and/or acceleration
actions under the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement could lead to an event of default and acceleration under
other debt instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions, including the Indenture.
If the Group's creditors, including the creditors under the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement, accelerate the
payment of those amounts, the Group cannot assure you that its assets would be sufficient to repay in full
those amounts, to satisfy all the Group's other liabilities that would be due and payable and to make
payments to enable it to redeem the Notes. In addition, if the Group is unable to repay those amounts, its
creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale of_**
**_particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The security documents relating to the Notes will allow the Issuer, the Guarantors and the other Collateral
providers to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and
dispose of any income from the Collateral to the extent that it relates to their assets. So long as no
acceleration event has occurred and subject to certain conditions, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the other
Collateral providers may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent,
conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or
otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of
indebtedness.

**_Certain Collateral will not initially secure the Notes and certain Guarantors will not initially guarantee_**
**_the Notes._**

As of the Issue Date, the Notes will not initially be secured by all of the Collateral. As further described in
"Description of the Notes—Security," the Notes will be secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles,
(i) by the Issue Date Collateral as of the Issue Date; (ii) in the event that the number of shares held by the
Bidder does not meet the Squeeze-Out Threshold on or before the Completion Date, by the Pre-SqueezeOut Collateral, and (iii) by the Post-Completion Collateral within 180 days following (and excluding) the
Control Date. If the Control Date does not occur, the Notes will not be secured by the Post-Completion
Collateral. As further described in "Description of the Notes—The Note Guarantees," the Notes will not be
guaranteed as of the Issue Date and the Guarantors will guarantee the Notes within 180 days following the
Control Date. If the Control Date does not occur, the Notes will not be guaranteed. In addition, the
obligation to provide guarantees and grant security is subject to certain limitations and agreed security
principles as well as local law considerations and which may also effect the scope, validity and
enforceability of the guarantees and security provided. See "Description of the Notes—Security,"
"Description of the Notes—The Note Guarantees" and "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations."_

**_The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence of_**
**_permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening periods (i.e., the periods of time following_**
**_the granting of security interests during which such security interests may be challenged in accordance_**
**_with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions)._**

The granting of security interests to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees may create hardening periods
for such security interests in certain jurisdictions. In addition, the Indenture specifically permits the release
and retaking of security that constitutes Collateral in connection with the incurrence of permitted
Indebtedness if certain conditions are satisfied. The granting of shared security interests to secure future
indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods. The
applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security
interest has been granted, perfected or recreated. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated
were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may
be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See "Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations."_


-----

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the accession of further
subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets and
equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes.

**_You may be required to pay a_** _"soulte" in the event you decide to enforce the pledges over shares of_
**_French companies by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Collateral consisting of shares rather_**
**_than by a sale of such Collateral in a public auction._**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due
and unpaid to it. The pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over a securities account or
in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) of French companies may be enforced
at the option of the secured creditor either by a sale of the pledged shares in a public auction (the proceeds
of the sale being paid to the secured creditors), by judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or by
contractual foreclosure (attribution conventionnelle or pacte commissoire) of the shares to the secured
creditor, following which the secured creditor becomes the legal owner of the pledged shares. In a
proceeding for _attribution judiciaire or attribution conventionnelle, an expert is appointed (whether_
contractually or by the court) to value the Collateral (in this case, the pledged shares) and if the value of the
Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt under the pledge, the secured creditor is required to pay the
relevant pledgor a soulte equal to the difference between the value of the shares and the amount of the
secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured
creditor from a subsequent sale of the Collateral.

Also, if the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether an attribution judiciaire or
_an attribution conventionnelle), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the_
foreclosed securities.

Consequently, in the event the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders
under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the New Term Loan B and the holders of the Notes or as creditor
of the parallel debt) decides to, and is entitled to, enforce the share pledges through a judicial or contractual
foreclosure and if the value of such shares exceeds the amount of the secured debt under the pledge, the
Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under the New Revolving Credit
Facility, the New Term Loan B and the holders of the Notes or as creditor of the parallel debt) may be
required to pay to the relevant pledgor a soulte equal to the value by which such shares exceeds the amount
of secured debt under the pledge.

If the value of such shares is less than the amount of the secured debt under the pledge, the relevant amount
owed to the relevant creditor will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such shares, and the
remaining amount owed to such creditor will be unsecured.

If the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under the New Revolving
Credit Facility, the New Term Loan B and the holders of the Notes or as creditor of the parallel debt)
declines to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the shares, a sale of the pledged shares could
be undertaken by public auction in accordance with applicable law. Due to the French regulatory restrictions
set forth in the immediately following risk factor, the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as
on behalf of the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the New Term Loan B and the holders
of the Notes or as creditor of the parallel debt) is likely to have an incentive to enforce the pledged shares
through a public auction. Since public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a
going concern (as the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale
organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant
to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies) it is
possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect our value as a going concern.

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The obligations under Notes and the Note Guarantees are secured on a first-ranking basis with security
interests over the Collateral that also secure our obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the
New Term Loan B and certain other indebtedness and hedging obligations. The Indenture also permits the
Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor
Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral
as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the
Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The Security Agent is not required to take


-----

enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that would consist of the holders of
the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, creditors in respect of indebtedness ranking
_pari passu_ with the Notes (including, but not limited to, obligations under the Term Loan B Facilities
Agreements) and creditors in respect of certain non-priority hedging obligations (the "Senior Secured
**Credit Participations") which aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations**
at that time (the "Notes/Pari Passu **Required Holders") (in each case acting through their respective**
creditor representatives). If certain indebtedness is designated as super senior indebtedness in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (see "Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement") then the instructing group may consist of either (i) creditors holding more than 50% of the_
indebtedness and commitments under certain indebtedness (including certain priority hedging) permitted
to rank super senior to the Notes on the proceeds of enforcement of Collateral and obligations (the
"Majority Super Senior Creditors") or (ii) the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders (in each case acting
through their respective creditor representatives). To the extent any indebtedness has been designated as
super senior, prior to the discharge in full of all Super Senior Liabilities (as defined in "Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement—Ranking and Priority—Priority of Debts"), the Notes/Pari Passu_
Required Holders (in each case acting through their respective creditor representatives) shall be the
instructing group, however: (i) if and to the extent the obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities have
not been fully discharged in cash within six months of enforcement instructions first being issued by either
the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders or the Majority Super Senior Creditors; or (ii) if Security Agent
has not commenced enforcement action within three months of enforcement instructions first being issued
by either the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, then the
enforcement instructions provided by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail.

To the extent no indebtedness is designated as super senior to the Notes, prior to giving the Security Agent
any enforcement instructions with respect to the Collateral, the creditor representatives of the Notes/Pari
Passu Required Holders will need to consult with each other and the Security Agent for a period of up to
ten business days, unless the Collateral has become enforceable pursuant to an insolvency event or the
Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders determine in good faith that to delay the taking of any enforcement
action could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent's ability to
enforce any transaction security or the realization of enforcement proceeds.

To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, the
voting interest of holders of Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount
of indebtedness we incur.

The lenders under the Term Loan B Facilities Agreements, and the creditors of any other credit facility and
the creditors in respect of certain hedging obligations may have interests that are different from the interests
of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue
their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders
of the Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral consisting of the shares of the Issuer
or any of its subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement, claims under the Note Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing
the Notes and the Note Guarantees may be released. See "Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement" and "Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens."_

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Notes
will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to
exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except through the Security Agent as
provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Notes, you will be deemed to have agreed to
these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and
recourse against the Issuer and the Guarantors in the event of a default. See "Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement."_

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Note Guarantees or the Collateral across_**
**_multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Luxembourg; the Guarantors are organized under the laws of
Austria, Belgium, England and Wales, France, Germany and Italy; the Collateral includes the shares of
certain of our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of certain of those jurisdictions, and certain present
and future intercompany loan receivables held by the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries in respect of
debtors in certain of these jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or a similar


-----

event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Your rights under the Notes, the Note
Guarantees and the Collateral are likely to be subject to insolvency and administrative laws of several
jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such
complex proceedings. In addition, the multi-jurisdictional nature of enforcement over the Collateral may
limit the realizable value of the Collateral.

The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer and the
Guarantors may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and with the laws of the United
States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability
to obtain post-petition interest, the duration of proceeding and preference periods. The application of these
laws, and any conflict between them, could call into question whether, and to what extent, the laws of any
particular jurisdiction should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the guarantees
and the security documents in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

**_The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as_**
**_security for the Notes and future secured indebtedness may be secured by certain assets that do not secure_**
**_the Notes._**

The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral, which consists of first-ranking
liens over the shares held by the Issuer and certain Guarantors in certain of our subsidiaries incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales, France, Germany and Luxembourg and certain present and future
intercompany loan receivables held by the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries. On the Issue Date, the Notes
and the Note Guarantees will be senior obligations of the Issuer, secured only by the Escrow Account
Charge. On the Completion Date, the Notes will be secured by security interests over the Completion Date
Collateral, which will be governed by the laws of Luxembourg, and, if applicable, the Pre-Squeeze-Out
Collateral, which will be governed by the law of Germany and/or Luxembourg. Within 180 days following
(and excluding) the Control Date, the Notes will be secured by security interests over the Post-Completion
Collateral, which will be governed by the laws of England and Wales, France, Germany and Luxembourg.
See "Description of the Notes—Security." Not all of our assets secure the Notes, and the Indenture allows
the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure any future senior secured indebtedness (as defined in the
Indenture) permitted to be incurred under the Indenture (which may be structurally senior to the Notes and
the guarantees) with the property and assets of the restricted subsidiaries that do not secure the Notes. The
value of such assets and property could be significant. If an event of default occurs and the obligations
under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the guarantees will not benefit from the assets securing such
secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and its
restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets that is or are excluded from the Collateral
securing the Notes or such secured debt.

While the Indenture creates certain obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional
security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future
assets or subsidiaries, the designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as a restricted subsidiary or otherwise,
such obligations are subject to certain agreed security principles. The agreed security principles set forth in
the Intercreditor Agreement set out a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes to be
granted security in certain circumstances. The operation of the agreed security principles may result in,
among other things, the amount recoverable under any Collateral provided being limited or security not
being granted over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the agreed security principles may
affect the value of the security provided by the Issuer and the Guarantors.

**_In certain jurisdictions, security over the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than_**
**_directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be_**
**_restricted by local law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the
obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes
but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement
provide that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce such security documents. As a consequence,
holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action
in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will provide instructions
(subject to the provisions of the Indenture) to the Security Agent.


-----

There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to the beneficial
owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in, or are directly parties to, a Security
Document will be validly secured and/or can be enforced; this area of law is untested in the courts of certain
jurisdictions. See "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security
_Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations."_

Due to the laws and jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security in certain jurisdictions
(including, but not limited to France and Germany) the security interests that constitutes security for the
obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees will be
granted in favor of the Security Agent as beneficiary of parallel debt obligations ("Parallel Debt") created
to satisfy a requirement that the Security Agent, as grantee of certain types of collateral, be a creditor of the
relevant Guarantor. The Parallel Debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations
of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes (the "Principal Obligations") but in certain jurisdictions,
these Parallel Debt provisions would not be applicable provided that the relevant case law has not ruled for
its application. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding
Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal
Obligations. The Security Agent will have, pursuant to the Parallel Debt, a claim against the Issuer for the
full principal amount of the Notes. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to enforce such security
except through the Security Agent. Holders of the Notes bear some risks associated with a possible
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. The Parallel Debt obligations referred to above are
contained in the Intercreditor Agreement or in a debtor accession deed applicable to a given Debtor, which
is governed by English law. There can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective before German
courts since there is no judicial or other guidance as to its efficacy, and therefore the ability of the Security
Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted as the Collateral may be invalid or unenforceable with
respect to the claims of any person who is not a party to the relevant security document, including all holders
of the Notes. In France, although the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recognized, in a
decision on Parallel Debt mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011, n°10-25.533 Belvédère) relating
to bond documentation governed by New York law, the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially
the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a collateral agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt, there
can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, such a
decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a
collateral agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt
construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security
interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the collateral agent as Parallel Debt Creditor under the
Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be
entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral.
In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or
bankruptcy of the collateral agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Intercreditor
Agreement will provide for the creation of "parallel debt" obligations in favor of the Security Agent.
Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable
by an obligor under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. To the extent that the security interests
in the Collateral created under the parallel debt structure are successfully challenged by other parties,
holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interest in the
Collateral.

Further, under a parallel debt structure, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the
possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the parallel debt.

The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important
following Defaults or Events of Default, and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of
the holders of the Notes.

See "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—France—Limitations on Enforcement—Parallel Debt" and_
"Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations—Germany—Accessory Security Interests/Parallel Debt."_


-----

**_Investors' rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in_**
**_the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor
of the security, as applicable. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with
respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of
these liens. The Security Agent will not be under any obligation to take any steps to perfect any such liens.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral_**
**_securing the Notes will be released automatically without your consent or the Trustee or the Security_**
**_Agent obtaining your further consent._**

Under a variety of circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically, including
a sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a transaction that does not violate the asset sale
covenant of the Indenture, and in connection with an enforcement sale permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement. The Indenture will also permit us to designate one or more restricted subsidiaries that are
Guarantors as unrestricted subsidiaries. If we designate a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for
purposes of the Indenture, all of the liens on the Collateral owned by such subsidiary and any guarantees
of the Notes by such subsidiary will be released under the Indenture, subject to certain conditions.
Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral securing
the Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such unrestricted subsidiary or of its subsidiaries.

**_The Note Guarantees and other security interests may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain_**
**_limitations or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

The Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, Austria, Belgium, England and Wales, France
and Italy. Enforcement of the obligations under a Guarantee against any such Guarantor will be subject to
certain defenses available to the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and
defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, preservation of share
capital, thin capitalization, related third-party transactions, corporate benefit, capital maintenance and
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally and may have the effect that the amounts
collectable under such Guarantee are reduced to zero.

In addition, each of the Note Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable
thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular
Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting
of such Note Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor's or security provider's corporate
interests, or the burden of such Note Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor
or security provider, or such Note Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance or
thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such
subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal
liability. In particular, enforcement of any such Note Guarantee or Collateral against the relevant Guarantor
or security provider would be subject to certain contractual limitations (so called "limitation language")
contained in the respective Indenture (or any other document governing the Note Guarantees) and Security
Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the
relevant Guarantor or security provider. As a result, a Guarantor's or security provider's liability under its
Guarantee or Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual
enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Note Guarantee or
Collateral cannot be enforced at all.

For example, the granting of guarantees and/or security interests by German Guarantors or German security
providers will be subject to (i) certain German capital maintenance rules of the German Act regarding
Companies with Limited Liability (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung) if that
Guarantor or security provider is incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a German limited liability
company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) or a German limited partnership with a German limited
liability company as general partner and (ii) certain capital maintenance and financial assistance rules set
out in the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) in relation to German stock corporations
(Aktiengesellschaften) as the Target and its subsidiaries. Guarantees and/or security interests provided by
an AG, GmbH and/or its direct or indirect subsidiaries in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of any
direct or indirect parent or affiliate company are, unless a specific exception applies, considered


-----

disbursements violating German capital maintenance law. Furthermore, the granting of guarantees by an
AG or its direct or indirect subsidiaries which serve the purpose of supporting the financing of the
acquisition of shares in such AG (financial assistance) is prohibited and, therefore, invalid. According to
the wording of the law, both the prohibition of financial assistance as well as the capital maintenance
requirements described above (for German Guarantors incorporated as GmbH and AG) are not applicable
while a DPLTA exists between the relevant AG or GmbH-Guarantor and the shareholder on whose
instructions the relevant guarantee is granted. However, the Indenture will not contain any covenant
requiring the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries to take any efforts to implement or maintain a DPLTA.
Furthermore, even in case a DPLTA is in place and provided that certain other requirements are met, the
granting of guarantees by a GmbH, AG and/or its direct or indirect subsidiaries may be considered to be in
violation of the capital maintenance rules and financial assistance restrictions, in which case such
guarantees and security interests can be void, unenforceable, restricted and/or subject to a redemption claim
against the beneficiary. In particular, under a view in German literature, the DPLTA exemption only applies
if payments under the guarantee do not cause the dominated entity (i.e., the relevant AG or GmbH
Guarantor) to incur a balance sheet loss for which it cannot reasonably expect to be compensated for by the
dominating entity due to the financial condition of the dominating entity. Therefore, any Guarantees
provided by an AG or GmbH, including the Guarantors and any of their direct and indirect subsidiaries will
be subject to certain contractual limitations (so called "limitation language") contained in the Indenture (or
any other document governing the Note Guarantees or Collateral) designed to ensure compliance with
applicable financial assistance, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or any other general statutory
laws. With respect to the DPLTA exemption, such contractual enforcement limitations will apply
notwithstanding the existence of a DPLTA if and to the extent despite the existence of a DPLTA there
would be a violation of the relevant capital maintenance and/or financial assistance rules in case of an
enforcement of the relevant guarantee obligations. If the Target will be converted into a German limited
liability company (GmbH) or otherwise ceases to be an AG (as further described in the definition of
"Control Date") only the limitations for GmbH will apply. See "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability
_of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Germany—_
_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests."_

The granting and enforcement of the Note Guarantee by the Guarantor in Austria is subject to, and may be
limited by, strict Austrian capital maintenance rules under Austrian corporate law. Under these rules,
guarantees given by an Austrian limited liability company or stock corporation for liabilities of a direct or
indirect parent or sister company are deemed to be disbursements in breach of Austrian capital maintenance
rules and are therefore invalid and unenforceable if the granting of such guarantees by the Austrian
company is not in its best interests and not fully justified by a business purpose (i.e., not for its corporate
benefit (betrieblich gerechtfertigt)). The Austrian Guarantor's Note Guarantee will therefore be subject to
"limitation language" which will provide, among other things, that any obligations and/or liabilities under
its Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount permitted under the Austrian capital
maintenance rules (which amount may be zero or close to zero). Accordingly, (i) the Note Guarantee of the
Guarantor in Austria will effectively have no monetary value, unless the Note Guarantee is in the best
interest of the Austrian Guarantor and fully justified by a business purpose (betriebliche Rechtfertigung)
and (ii) amounts recoverable under the Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed by the Guarantor under the applicable law. Although common practice, the limitation language
has not been tested by Austrian courts. See "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note
_Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Austria—Limitations_
_on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantee."_

Furthermore, to reduce the risk of triggering Austrian stamp duty with respect to the Austrian Guarantor's
Note Guarantee, the obligations guaranteed by the Austrian Guarantor's Note Guarantee will be limited to
guaranteeing/securing claims that are considered credit-claims (including interest and possibly typical
ancillary charges) of a lender or creditor against a borrower under a loan or credit agreement (which, for
the purposes of the Austrian Stamp Duty Act, includes such claims against an issuer under a bond issue).
See "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Austria—Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note_
_Guarantee—Stamp Duty."_

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing, or providing security
in relation to, indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its
acquisition. Under French corporate benefit rules, a court could declare any guarantee or security
unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, or any proceeds have
been obtained from the enforcement of any security, require that the recipient return the payment or any


-----

proceeds so obtained to the relevant guarantor or security provider, if the court found that the French
guarantor or security provider did not receive some real and adequate corporate benefit from the transaction
involving the grant of the guarantee or security as a whole. Existence of corporate benefit is a factual matter
which must be determined on a case-by-case basis. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the
guarantor or security provider and whether the amounts guaranteed or secured are commensurate with the
benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

Furthermore, your ability to enforce the pledges over certain security may be limited by French law
restrictions on the ownership of laboratory companies and future regulatory changes may have an impact
on the value of the Collateral. French law provides restrictions on the ownership of the capital of laboratory
companies, including in some cases on indirect ownership. In particular, Article L. 6223‑5 of the French
Public Health Code forbids various categories of persons from making any direct or indirect investment in
the share capital of a company operating a French clinical laboratory, on the basis of their activities or
relations with certain activities in the medical, life insurance or paramedical sectors to name a few (the
"prohibited investors") (see "Regulation—France"). As a result, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce
a pledge on the share capital of certain of our subsidiaries that indirectly own French laboratory companies
is limited by such French law restrictions. For instance, the shares may not be acquired by an entity falling
within the category of "prohibited investors" if this acquisition leads to a breach of Article L. 6223-5 of the
French Public Health Code.

Under Italian financial assistance rules (set out in Article 2358 of the Italian civil code for companies
incorporated as a società per azioni and Article 2474 of the Italian civil code for companies incorporated
as società a responsabilità limitata), an Italian company is prevented from providing, directly or indirectly,
financial assistance (whether giving security or a guarantee, granting loans or providing credit support in
other forms) for the acquisition and/or refinancing of acquisition of (or subscription to) its own shares or
shares of any its direct or indirect parent companies.

Under Italian financial assistance rules, any guarantee or security provided in breach of the financial
assistance prohibitions would be unenforceable. In the event the acquisition funds cannot be clearly
identified and separated from other funds, an Italian court could consider the relevant guarantee or security
provided by an Italian company unenforceable even if such guarantee or security includes general carveouts intending to exclude from the scope of the guarantee or security any financial support which may be
considered to be in breach of Italian financial assistance prohibitions. In addition, directors may be
personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the relevant Italian company.

It is possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or
other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider,
may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor's Guarantee or the security provider's Collateral
on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Guarantee or Collateral
should be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Guarantees or Collateral
apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor
or security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future Guarantees
and Collateral may be subject to similar limitations.

An increase in the amount of debt that benefits from such Note Guarantee without a corresponding increase
in the amount of the Guarantee will dilute the value of such Note Guarantee to its beneficiaries, including
the holders of the Notes. See "Description of the Notes—The Note Guarantees" and "Limitations on Validity
_and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations."_

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and liabilities and other obligations of_**
**_our subsidiaries._**

The Notes will not be guaranteed on the Issue Date. Within 180 days of the Control Date, the Notes will be
guaranteed on a senior basis by the Guarantors. However, not all of the Group's subsidiaries will guarantee
the Notes. Any claim by any member of the Group or any of its creditors, including the holders of the Notes,
against any of the Group's non-Guarantor subsidiaries will be structurally subordinated to all of the claims
of creditors of such subsidiaries. The Indenture will not limit the transfer of assets to, or the making of
investments in any Restricted Subsidiaries, including subsidiaries that do not provide guarantees for the
Notes. In the event of insolvency, liquidation or other reorganization of any non-Guarantor subsidiaries,
creditors of these subsidiaries will generally be entitled to payment in full from their respective assets before


-----

the Issuer is entitled to receive any distribution from such assets as equity holders. Except to the extent that
the Issuer may itself be a creditor with recognized claims against a subsidiary, claims of creditors of such
subsidiary, including trade creditors, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of that
subsidiary over the claims of the Issuer as an equity holder, although there is no assurance that the claims
of the Issuer as a creditor against a subsidiary may not be reduced, limited or extinguished as a result of
applicable insolvency rules (such as the doctrine of equitable subordination or the rules regarding the
potential avoidance of transactions concluded with related persons within a certain hardening period). The
Group's subsidiaries are also subject to liabilities to other creditors as a result of obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business, which liabilities are also effectively senior to the Notes and the Note
Guarantees. As such, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors
(including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of the Group's non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

In addition, the consolidated financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum refer to the Target
Group and therefore contain information on both Guarantors and non-Guarantors. The consolidated
financial statements may be of limited use in assessing the financial position of the Issuer and the Guarantors
separate from the non-Guarantors.

**_The insolvency laws of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to you as the laws of other jurisdictions._**
**_Furthermore, the Issuer may shift its "centre of main interests" to jurisdictions that are less favorable_**
**_to you._**

The Issuer is subject to the laws and regulation of the laws of Luxembourg including its insolvency regime.
The insolvency laws of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to you as the laws of other jurisdictions.
Pursuant to the Regulation (EU) no. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20,
2015 on insolvency proceedings (the "EU Insolvency Regulation") entered into force on June 26, 2017,
which applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), the court which shall have jurisdiction to
open main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State where the
company has its "centre of main interests." According to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, this
is "the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is
ascertainable by third parties." The determination of where any such company has its "centre of main
interests" is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and
even conflicting views. The term "centre of main interests" is not a static concept and may change from
time to time.

Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a
company has its "centre of main interests" in the Member State in which it has its registered office, this
presumption only applies, if the registered office has not been moved to another EU member state within
the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Since the Issuer is
organized under the laws of Luxembourg and has its registered office in Luxembourg a court is therefore
likely to hold that the "centre of main interests" of the Issuer is in Luxembourg. Consequently, and provided
_that this presumption will not be rebutted and the "centre of main interests" will not be shifted to another_
jurisdiction by the Issuer, any insolvency proceedings with regard to the Issuer are likely to be initiated in
Luxembourg and would most likely be governed by the insolvency laws of Luxembourg. The provisions
of Luxembourg insolvency law may differ substantially from the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions,
including with respect to preferred satisfaction of secured creditors from enforcement proceedings, the
ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may be
less favorable to you than comparable provisions of other jurisdictions. The Issuer may shift its "centre of
main interests" again, and thereby the applicable restructuring or insolvency laws, to another jurisdiction,
which could offer less favorable terms to you than the laws of Luxembourg. In addition, even without such
intentional shift of the "centre of main interests" by the Issuer, it cannot be ruled out that a court or other
competent authority of such other jurisdiction, will deem the restructuring or insolvency laws of such


-----

jurisdiction to be applicable and opens restructuring or insolvency proceedings under the laws of such
jurisdiction with or without the consent of the Issuer.

Thus, the ability of Noteholders to recover payments due on the Notes may be or may become more limited
or precluded than would be the case under the laws of other jurisdictions.

**_The interests of our ultimate principal shareholder may be inconsistent with your interests._**

Following the consummation of the Transaction, our ultimate principal shareholder, Cinven, indirectly will
own a substantial majority of our issued and outstanding shares through investment management funds.
The interests of our principal shareholder could conflict with the interests of investors in the Notes,
particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. Our principal
shareholder could cause us to pursue acquisitions or divestitures and other transactions or to make large
dividend payments (subject to limitations in the Indenture) or other distributions or payments to it as the
shareholder, even though such transactions may involve increased risk for the holders of the Notes.
Furthermore, no assurance can be given that our principal shareholder will not sell all or any part of its
shareholding at any time nor that it will not look to reduce its holding by means of a sale to a strategic
investor, an equity offering or otherwise. Such divestitures may not trigger a "Change of Control" under
the Indenture if certain conditions are satisfied, including, inter alia, if after giving pro forma effect to such
transaction, the consolidated leverage ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries would have been
no greater than certain thresholds specified in the Indenture.

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, or will not be, and are not required to be,
registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered
or sold in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, to persons outside the United
States in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and all other applicable laws. These
restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of investors in the Notes
to ensure that all offers and sales of the Notes in the United States and other countries comply with
applicable securities laws. See "Notice to Investors."

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on the procedures_**
**_of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Interests in the global Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in definitive registered form, or
definitive registered Notes, will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very limited
circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The
common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the
global notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in
respect of the global notes representing the Notes will be made to the paying agent, which will make
payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants'
accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such
participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and
Clearstream, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other
amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they
must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear
and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest,
to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to
act upon the Issuer's solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the
Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has
received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the
granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis.


-----

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until definitive
registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests, they
will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented through
Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See
"Book-Entry, Delivery and Form."

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will_**
**_be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

  - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

  - your ability to sell your Notes; or

  - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing
interest rates, our results of operations and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a trading market
for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. Any such disruption may have a negative
effect on you, as a holder of Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. Certain initial
purchasers have advised that they intend to make a market in the Notes after completing the Offering.
However, they have no obligation to do so and may discontinue market-making activities at any time
without notice. In addition, such market-making activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the
Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations. As a result, there may not be an active trading
market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at a
fair value, if at all.

**_Other variable interest rate debt we incurred or will incur in the future bear or will bear interest at_**
**_floating rates that could rise significantly, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

The Group is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, particularly under the 2023 Senior
Facilities Agreement, as borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility and New Term Loan B will
bear interest at a floating rate. See "Description of Other Indebtedness—2023 Senior Facilities Agreement."
Further, the debt of the Target under the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B bears interest at a floating rate
and is expected to remain in place following the Acquisition if the Squeeze-Out Threshold is met on or
before the Completion Date. The Group may also enter into additional indebtedness bearing floating rates
of interest in the future. Although the Group may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements
designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurances that hedging will continue to be available
on commercially reasonable terms. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our
interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures
and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Although we currently have hedging
arrangements in place for a portion of our floating rate indebtedness and may in the future enter into and
maintain certain other hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no
assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself
carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate
any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense would
correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

EURIBOR has been subject to recent reform to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements of a
critical benchmark, and there are no present plans to replace it with an alternative rate. However, similar
future reforms and other pressures may cause EURIBOR or other such benchmarks to disappear entirely,
to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create
disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have
other consequences which cannot be predicted. The potential elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark or
any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators
or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which the interest rate is determined,


-----

which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect
of any debt linked to such benchmark, including the New Term Loan B, the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan
B and the New Revolving Credit Facility. Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the
cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR, which could have
an adverse impact on the Group's ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest, and
have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and
its ability to make payments on the Notes and on the trading price of the Notes.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euros. If investors measure their investment returns by
reference to a currency other than euros, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related
risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the
currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments. These changes may
be due to economic, political and other factors over which we have no control.

Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which such investors measure the return on
their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates
and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by
reference to which such investors measure the return on their investments.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and its respective subsidiaries are organized outside the United States, and its business is
conducted outside the United States. The directors and executive officers of the Issuer are non-residents of
the United States. Although the Issuer will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in
connection with any action under U.S. securities laws or under the Indenture, you may be unable to effect
service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuer. In addition,
because the assets of the Issuer and the assets of their directors and executive officers are located outside
of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in the U.S. courts.
Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer may not be subject
to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. See "Service of Process
_and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities."_

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be_**
**_subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not
reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed
above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to
buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency
at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time
or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its
judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the
credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the
cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the
Notes.

**_If certain changes to tax law were to occur, we would have the option to redeem the Notes._**

If certain changes in the law of any relevant taxing jurisdiction, as defined under "Description of the Notes—
_Redemption for Changes in Taxes," become effective that would impose withholding taxes or other_
deductions on the payments on the Notes, we may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at a
redemption price of 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. We are unable to determine whether such a change
to any tax laws will be enacted, but if such change does occur, the Notes will be redeemable at our option.


-----

**_We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control._**

The Notes contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a "change of control" in relation to the
Issuer. Upon the occurrence of a change of control, the Issuer is required to make an offer to purchase all
outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any. If a change of control were to occur, we can provide no assurance that we will
have sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes and any other indebtedness with
similar provisions.

In addition, our other indebtedness may contain restrictions or repayment requirements with respect to
certain events or transactions that could constitute a change of control under the terms of the Indenture. The
inability to purchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control would constitute an event of
default under the terms and conditions governing the Notes, which would trigger a cross-default under the
Notes and vice versa. See "Description of the Notes—Change of Control."

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the
event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring or other similar
refinancings involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a
shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a "change of control"
as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under "Description of the Notes—Change of Control," the
Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the
Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, recapitalization or similar refinancing.

The definition of "change of control" in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "all or substantially all," there is no precise established
definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree
of uncertainty as to whether a particular refinancing would involve a disposition of "all or substantially all"
of the Issuer's assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to
whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase
the Notes.

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on The International Stock Exchange Authority_**
**_Limited._**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List in accordance with the rules and regulations
of the Authority. The Issuer cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed. If the Notes are
listed on the Official List, and the Issuer can no longer maintain such listing or if it becomes unduly
burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the
Official List; provided, however, that it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain
the listing of the Notes on another "recognized stock exchange," although there can be no assurance that
the Issuer will be able to do so.

In addition, although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing the Notes on
the Official List or another recognized stock exchange in accordance with the Indenture, failure to obtain
approval for the listing or the delisting of the Notes from the Official List or another recognized stock
exchange, as applicable, may have a material adverse effect on a holder's ability to resell Notes in the
secondary market.

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

**The Acquisition**

**_The Acquisition Offer_**

On September 29, 2023, the Bidder, an entity controlled by funds managed and/or advised by Cinven,
announced its decision to launch a public acquisition offer for all outstanding shares of the Target not
directly held by it at a price of €10.00 per share in cash (the "Acquisition Offer"). The offer price
represented a premium of approximately 42% to the Xetra closing share price of the Target on March 10,
2023, which was the last trading day prior to the Target's ad hoc announcement of a non-binding expression
of interest by Cinven.

Also on September 29, 2023, the Management Board and Supervisory Board announced that they had
approved and the Target entered into an investment agreement with the Bidder and Ephios Bidco (the
"Investment Agreement") backing the Group's long-term strategy and were comfortable with the
Acquisition Offer.

The offer document for the Acquisition Offer was published on October 23, 2023.

On November 2, 2023, the Management Board and Supervisory Board published a joint reasoned statement
in which they gave a neutral statement. All members of the Management Board have signed irrevocable
undertakings to sell their shares in the Acquisition Offer and the members of the Supervisory Board
declared that they will tender all shares they currently may hold or indirectly control (save for the shares
held by Dr. Wimmer Verwaltungs GmbH & Co. KG that are subject to the co-investment agreement
discussed under "—Co-Investment Agreements" below).

The share capital of the Target amounts to €222,222,222 and is divided into 222,222,222 non-par value
bearer shares. The Target holds 2,490,791 shares (representing 1.1% of its share capital) as treasury shares.
Therefore, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the total number of shares carrying voting rights
amounts to 219,731,431 shares.

The offer acceptance period ended on November 20, 2023, at which time the Bidder had secured a total of
188,112,767 shares, representing 84.7% of the share capital and 85.6% of the voting rights of the Target.
As set out below, such shares were secured through a combination of (i) the Bidder's own holdings at the
commencement of the Acquisition Offer, (ii) co-investment agreements, (iii) irrevocable undertakings to
tender or (iv) other public tenders.

_Bidder's Holdings at the Commencement of the Acquisition Offer_

At the commencement of the Acquisition Offer and as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Bidder
directly holds 95,000,648 shares of the Target and persons acting jointly with the Bidder (within the
meaning of Section 2 paragraph 5 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act
(Wertpapiererwerbs- und Übernahmegesetz)) directly hold 95,745 shares of the Target. These 95,096,393
shares collectively represent 42.8% of the share capital and 43.3% of the voting rights of the Target.

_Co-Investment Agreements_

The Bidder entered into co-investment agreements with Qatar Holding LLC with respect to 11,111,111
shares and with Dr. Wimmer Verwaltungs GmbH & Co. KG with respect to 4,226,360 shares, all of which
will be contributed into Ephios Holdco against the issuance of new equity securities in Ephios Holdco.
These 15,337,471 shares collectively represent 6.9% of the share capital and 7.0% of the voting rights of
the Target.

_Irrevocable Undertakings_

The tendered shares include 38,076,435 shares held by Novo Invest 1 A/S, 18,676,689 shares held by
Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board, 6,339,540 shares held by Dr. Wimmer Verwaltungs GmbH & Co.
KG, 850,506 shares held by Mathieu Floreani and 628,058 shares held by Sami Badarani, each of whom
has entered into an irrevocable undertaking to sell their respective shares in the Target to the Bidder at the
acquisition offer price. These 64,571,228 shares collectively represent 29.1% of the share capital and 29.4%
of the voting rights of the Target.


-----

_Other Public Tenders_

In addition, 13,107,675 shares of the Target were tendered in the Acquisition Offer by other shareholders
of the Target during the acceptance period. Such shares represent 5.9% of the share capital and 6.0% of the
voting rights of the Target.

**_Further Acquisitions of Target Shares_**

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, 31,618,664 shares, representing 14.2% of the share capital
and 14.4% of the voting rights of the Target, are publicly held, have not been tendered and are not subject
to co-investment agreements or irrevocable undertakings. The Bidder reserves the right to acquire, directly
or indirectly, if and to the extent legally permissible, any such publicly held shares outside of the
Acquisition Offer on or off the stock exchange.

**_Share Push-Down_**

In connection with the Acquisition, following settlement of the Acquisition Offer, all of the shares of the
Target held by the Bidder and Ephios Holdco will be transferred to Ephios Bidco (the "Share Push-Down").
Such transfers will be effected, at the Bidder's discretion, through a mix of the following exercises:
(i) contributions through the chain of subsidiaries of the Bidder and Ephios Holdco by way of equity
contributions against issuance of shares and/or equity contributions into the capital reserves; (ii) transfers
to Ephios Bidco as repayment in kind of certain upstream loan payables of the Bidder granted by Ephios
Bidco for the purpose of financing the Acquisition Offer; and (iii) sales and transfers from the Bidder to
Ephios Bidco against cash consideration not exceeding the Acquisition Offer price.

**_Control Date_**

Despite holding a majority of the voting rights upon settlement of the Acquisition Offer and being able to
acquire additional shares of the Target, the Bidder will not control the Target and its ability to influence the
Management Board of the Target will be limited until the Control Date. In addition, entities in the Target
Group will not be able to provide guarantees or security with respect to the Notes until the Control Date
has occurred. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Acquisition—The Issuer does not control the
_Management Board and will not control the daily business of the Target Group until the Control Date and_
_there can be no assurance that the Control Date will occur."_

**_Structural Measures_**

Following the consummation of the Share Push-Down, Ephios Bidco may, subject to economic and
regulatory circumstances, which may include the development of the stock exchange trading price of the
Target shares and the number of shares that it has secured, consider implementing one or more structural
measures.

_Delisting_

Ephios Bidco may consider, in cooperation with the Management Board, announcing and implementing a
delisting procedure pursuant to Section 39 of the German Stock Exchange Act (Börsengesetz) and the
withdrawal of the admission for trading of the Target's shares from the open market segments of the relevant
stock exchanges. In case of such a delisting, a delisting acquisition offer will be made to all remaining
Target shareholders to acquire their shares in exchange for the granting of adequate cash compensation,
which could be equal in value to the Acquisition Offer price, but could also be lower or higher. It is
anticipated that a delisting acquisition offer, if implemented, would take approximately two to three months
to complete. A delisting acquisition offer, if it results in Ephios Bidco holding shares above the SqueezeOut Threshold (as defined below), may be followed by a squeeze-out procedure, as discussed below, at the
discretion of Ephios Bidco.

_Corporate Squeeze-Out_

If Ephios Bidco holds at least 95% of the share capital of the Target in the future, it will be entitled to
implement a squeeze-out procedure under German stock corporation law procedure pursuant to
Section 327a et seqq. of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz). In such case, the remaining
shareholders of the Target will be required to transfer their shares to Ephios Bidco in exchange for adequate


-----

cash compensation. The appropriateness of the amount of such cash compensation can be challenged in
appraisal proceedings.

_Merger Squeeze-Out_

If Ephios Bidco holds at least 90% (the "Squeeze-Out Threshold") of the share capital of the Target and
if Ephios Bidco converts its legal form into the legal form of a German stock corporation (or if another
subsidiary of the Bidder has the legal form of a German stock corporation) (a "Bidco Conversion") and
has become the shareholder of at least 90% of the share capital of the Target, it will have the right to
implement a squeeze-out pursuant to Section 62 paragraph 5 of the German Transformation Act
(Umwandlungsgesetz) by merging the Target into Ephios Bidco (or such subsidiary, as the case may be).
Such squeeze-out would also have the effect that all remaining Target shareholders will be required to
transfer their shares in exchange for adequate cash compensation and the appropriateness of the amount of
such cash compensation can be challenged in appraisal proceedings.

A Bidco Conversion would further limit the credit support that can be provided by Ephios Bidco (or such
other German stock corporation subsidiary of the Bidder) and, as such, after the merger of the Target into
Ephios Bidco (or such other German stock corporation subsidiary of the Bidder) becoming effective, would
also limit the credit support being provided by the Target Group. In the case of a Bidco Conversion and a
subsequent merger squeeze out (as described above), following the occurrence of the Control Date, the
credit support provided by Ephios Bidco and its subsidiaries (including the Target Group) would be
restricted as detailed for German AGs under "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note
_Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Germany." This_
limitation could be mitigated by the converted Ephios Bidco (or such other German stock corporation
subsidiary of the Bidder) entering into a DPLTA with its direct shareholder; however, there is no obligation
in the Indenture for the Issuer to enter into a DPLTA or to otherwise ensure that the Control Date will occur
or that credit support is facilitated.

The consummation of any squeeze-out proceeding described above would automatically result in the
delisting of the Target's shares from the stock exchange if a delisting has not been implemented earlier by
way of termination the admission for trading from the stock exchange as described above.

_DPLTA_

A DPLTA is not required for the Bidder and/or Ephios Bidco to finance the Acquisition Offer or to realize
its economic and strategic objectives.

**_Completion_**

Completion of the Acquisition Offer remains subject to regulatory clearances. As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, the Acquisition has received merger clearances by the European Commission and the
competent authorities in Colombia, Mexico, Nigeria and Türkiye. Merger control clearance for the
Acquisition by the competent authority in Colombia remains pending. As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, the Acquisition has received foreign investment control clearances by the competent
authorities in Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark and France. Foreign investment control clearances by
the competent authorities in Germany, Italy, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden remain
pending. In addition, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, EU foreign subsidies control clearance
remains pending.

Subject to receipt of these regulatory clearances, the Acquisition Offer is expected to be settled in the first
quarter of 2024. However, this timing indication is an estimate and it is not possible to make a binding
commitment as to if and when all regulatory proceedings will be completed.

**The Financing**

The Acquisition Offer is expected to be financed using (i) the gross proceeds of the Offering (upon
satisfaction of the conditions to release the proceeds of the Offering from the Escrow Account),
(ii) borrowings under the New Term Loan B and (iii) the proceeds of certain committed and fully
subordinated PIK debt to be issued by Ephios Subco 1 on or prior to the Completion Date and on-lent to
the Issuer. The funds will be lent to the Bidder and (i) used to fund the Acquisition Offer for all tendered
shares of the Target, (ii) offered to the Target to be used, together with cash on the Target's balance sheet,
to repay certain existing external indebtedness of the Target Group and (iii) used to pay the fees, premiums


-----

and expenses incurred in connection with the Acquisition Offer and the Financing, including estimated fees
and expenses to be incurred in connection with the Offering. See "Use of Proceeds."

As of the Issue Date, the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement will also provide for the New Revolving Credit
Facility in the amount of €500.0 million. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the New Revolving
Credit Facility is not expected to be drawn as of the Completion Date.

The above financings are collectively referred to herein as the "Financing" and the Financing and the
Acquisition are collectively referred to herein as the "Transactions."


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The gross proceeds of the Offering will be approximately €550.0 million. The gross proceeds of the
Offering will be placed into the Escrow Account on the Issue Date. Upon satisfaction of the conditions to
release the proceeds of the Offering from the Escrow Account, the gross proceeds of the Offering will be
used together with (i) borrowings under the New Term Loan B and (ii) the proceeds of certain committed
and fully subordinated PIK debt to be issued by Ephios Subco 1 on or prior to the Completion Date and onlent to the Issuer to finance the Acquisition Offer. The funds will be lent to the Bidder and (i) used to fund
the Acquisition Offer for all tendered shares of the Target, (ii) offered to the Target to be used, together
with cash on the Target's balance sheet, to repay certain existing external indebtedness of the Target Group
and (iii) used to pay the fees, premiums and expenses incurred in connection with the Acquisition Offer
and the Financing, including estimated fees and expenses to be incurred in connection with the Offering.
For further information, see "The Transactions."

The estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the Transactions are shown in the
table below, assuming that 100% of the Target's shares are acquired and the Existing Term Loan A is paid
in full in connection with the Transactions. Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending
on several factors, including accrued interest on debt being repaid, differences from our estimates of fees
and expenses associated with the Transactions and the actual Completion Date.

**Sources** **Amount** **Uses** **Amount**

_(€ millions)_ _(€ millions)_

_______________
(1) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby.

(2) Represents the expected aggregate amount of New Term Loan B borrowings under the 2023 Term Loan Facilities. See
"Description of Other Indebtedness—2023 Term Loan Facilities." Concurrently with the Offering, the Issuer is syndicating the
New Term Loan B. On the pricing date for the Notes, the Issuer expects to allocate an aggregate amount of up to €1,450.0 million
of senior debt consisting of the Notes and the New Term Loan B. The final allocation between the Notes and the Term Loan B is
subject to final determination on the pricing date for the Notes based on market conditions.

(3) On September 21, 2023, the Bidder entered into an interim "payment-in-kind" (PIK) facility with certain lenders in an aggregate
amount of up to €500.0 million. On or prior to the Completion Date, Ephios Subco 1 is expected to enter into an equivalent longterm PIK Notes purchase agreement providing for a PIK facility in an aggregate amount of up to €500.0 million and the
commitments under the interim PIK facility will be cancelled. The amounts received under the PIK facility will then be made
available, on the basis of a commitment letter dated September 28, 2023, by Ephios Subco 1 through Ephios Subco 2, the Issuer
and Ephios Bidco, to the Bidder on or prior to the Completion Date.

(4) Represents cash on the Target's statement of financial position available for purposes of the Transactions, namely the repayment
of the Existing Term Loan A. In the event that the number of shares of the Target held by the Bidder does not meet the SqueezeOut Threshold, it is anticipated that an amount greater than the €40.0 million of cash on the Target's statement of financial position
indicated in the table above may be used in connection with the Transactions. In such scenario, the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan
B is expected to be repaid in part or in full using cash on the Target's balance sheet, proceeds of the Offering and/or borrowings
under the New Term Loan B that are not required to be utilized for purposes of acquiring shares of the Target. The higher amount
of the Target's cash that would be utilized in the Transactions if the Squeeze-Out Threshold is not met is therefore a consequence
of the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B being repaid in part or in full in such scenario and additional funds from the proceeds of
the Offering and/or borrowings under the New Term Loan B being required to purchase shares of the Target or for such debt
repayment. For example, if the Bidder acquires the 41.9% of the share capital of the Target that it does not currently own, but has
been tendered in the Acquisition Offer or is subject to co-investment agreements or irrevocable undertakings as of the date of this
Offering Memorandum, and as a result will own 84.7% of the share capital of the Target following the Acquisitions, it is
anticipated that the €385.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B would be repaid in full
and a total of €84.0 million of cash on the Target's balance sheet would be used in connection with the Transactions. If the Bidder's
ownership is above 84.7% of the share capital of the Target, but remains below the Squeeze-Out Threshold, the amount of cash
used in the Transactions and the amount of the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B repayment will vary.

(5) As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Bidder has secured 188,112,767 shares, representing 84.7% of the share capital
and 85.6% of the voting rights of the Target, including 95,096,393 shares, or 42.8% of the share capital of the Target, held directly
by the Bidder or persons acting jointly with the Bidder (within the meaning of Section 2 paragraph 5 of the German Securities
Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und Übernahmegesetz)), and 93,016,374 shares, or 41.9% of the share capital
of the Target, that have been tendered in the Acquisition Offer or are subject to co-investment agreements or irrevocable
undertakings. See "The Transactions—The Acquisition—The Acquisition Offer."

In the event that the number of shares of the Target held by the Bidder does not meet the Squeeze-Out Threshold, it is anticipated
that an amount less than the €1,287.0 million of funds indicated in the table above will be used to acquire Target shares. The
lower amount that would be utilized in the Transactions if the Squeeze-Out Threshold is not met is a consequence of fewer shares
being purchased in such scenario. For example, if the Bidder acquires the 41.9% of the share capital of the Target that it does not


-----

currently own, but has been tendered in the Acquisition Offer or is subject to co-investment agreements or irrevocable
undertakings as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, and as a result will own 84.7% of the share capital of the Target
following the Acquisitions, it is anticipated that €946.0 million will be used to acquire Target shares. In such scenario, the Existing
SYNLAB Term Loan B is expected to be repaid in full. If the Bidder's ownership is above 84.7% of the share capital of the
Target, but remains below the Squeeze-Out Threshold, the amount used to acquire Target shares and the amount of the Existing
SYNLAB Term Loan B repayment will vary.

(6) Represents the aggregate amount of indebtedness of the Target Group under the 2021 Term Loan Facility that is outstanding as
of the date of this Offering Memorandum and is expected to remain outstanding until being repaid in connection with the
Transactions. The Existing Term Loan A was originally borrowed in an aggregate amount of €735.0 million. The Target Group
prepaid €200.0 million of the loan in October and November 2023 using the proceeds of certain asset sales, including the sale of
its veterinary diagnostics business in Belgium, Germany and Spain. The Target Group may voluntarily prepay the whole or any
part of the loan made under the 2021 Term Loan Facility by giving prior notice (without premium or penalty). The remaining
€535.0 million of borrowings under the Existing Term Loan A as of the date of this Offering Memorandum is expected to be
repaid either (i) if the Squeeze-Out Threshold is met, the repayment is expected to be in cash or (ii) if the Squeeze-Out Threshold
is not met, the Existing Term Loan A is expected to be refinanced with a shareholder loan from the Issuer to the Target on terms
acceptable to the Target.

(7) Represents estimated fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including commitment, underwriting, financial
advisory, legal, accounting, ratings advisory, other advisory fees, consortium fees and other transaction costs and professional
fees, and including net interest expense and other fees that will accrue on proceeds of the Notes while held in the Escrow Account.
These fees and expenses have been estimated as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and are subject to change.

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table should be read in conjunction with "Use of Proceeds," "Management's Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Description of Other Indebtedness" and the_
financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Except
as set forth below, there have been no other material changes to the capitalization of the Issuer or the Target
Group since September 30, 2023. Actual amounts may vary from estimated amounts depending on several
factors, including the Completion Date, the amount of cash available to the Target Group, the actual amount
of existing external indebtedness of the Target Group being repaid (including any accrued and unpaid
interest thereon and any other prepayment premiums) and differences between estimated and actual fees
and expenses related to the Transactions.

The adjusted amounts do not reflect the accounting treatment of the Transactions, especially the Acquisition
under IFRS. The following table sets forth the consolidated available cash and capitalization as of
September 30, 2023 for the Target on a historical consolidated basis and on an as adjusted basis to give pro
_forma effect to the Transactions._

_______________
(1) The actual column represents the Target's cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2023 as reflected on the Target's
statement of financial position included in the Interim Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.
The "as adjusted" column represents cash and cash equivalents adjusted (i) for its aggregate €200.0 million partial prepayment of
the Existing Term Loan A in October and November 2023 and (ii) to give pro forma effect to the use of cash on the Target's
balance sheet, as reflected in "Use of Proceeds." Such adjustments are partially offset by additional cash that has been, or will be,
generated by the Target between October 1, 2023 and the Completion Date, resulting in the Issuer's anticipated "as adjusted" cash
position pro forma for the completion of the Transactions.

In the event that the number of shares of the Target held by the Bidder does not meet the Squeeze-Out Threshold, it is anticipated
that an amount greater than the €40.0 million of cash on the Target's balance sheet indicated in "Use of Proceeds" may be used
in connection with the Transactions. See footnote (4) under "Use of Proceeds." As a result, cash and cash equivalents on an "as
adjusted" basis would be expected to be lower if the Squeeze-Out Threshold is not met. For example, if the Bidder acquires the
41.9% of the share capital of the Target that it does not currently own, but has been tendered in the Acquisition Offer or is subject
to co-investment agreements or irrevocable undertakings as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, and as a result will own
84.7% of the share capital of the Target following the Acquisitions, it is anticipated that the €385.0 million of outstanding
borrowings under the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B would be repaid in full and a total of €84.0 million of cash on the Target's
balance sheet would be used in connection with the Transactions, in which case "as adjusted" cash and cash equivalents would
be expected to be €156.0 million, reflecting an adjustment of €(248.2) million. If the Bidder's ownership is above 84.7% of the
share capital of the Target, but remains below the Squeeze-Out Threshold, the amount of cash used in the Transactions and the
amount of the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B repayment will vary.

(2) Represents the Existing Revolving Credit Facility of the Target Group. As of September 30, 2023, no drawings were outstanding
under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. The Existing Revolving Credit Facility will be cancelled on the Completion Date.

(3) In connection with the Transactions, the Issuer will enter into a €500.0 million New Revolving Credit Facility, which will be
undrawn on the Issue Date and, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, is expected to remain undrawn as of the Completion
Date. For additional information on the New Revolving Credit Facility, see "Description of Other Indebtedness—New Revolving
_Credit Facility."_

(4) Represents the aggregate amount of indebtedness of the Target Group under the 2021 Term Loan Facility as of September 30,
2023. The Existing Term Loan A was originally borrowed in an aggregate amount of €735.0 million. The Target Group prepaid
€200.0 million of the loan in October and November 2023 using the proceeds of certain asset sales, including the sale of its
veterinary diagnostics business in Belgium, Germany and Spain. The remaining €535.0 million of borrowings under the Existing


-----

Term Loan A as of the date of this Offering Memorandum is expected to be repaid either (i) if the Squeeze-Out Threshold is met,
the repayment is expected to be in cash or (ii) if the Squeeze-Out Threshold is not met, the Existing Term Loan A is expected to
be refinanced with a shareholder loan from the Issuer to the Target on terms acceptable to the Target.

(5) Represents €385.0 million term loans maturing in 2027 that were made to SYNLAB Bondco PLC pursuant to the credit facility
agreement, dated as of June 22, 2019, and as amended from time to time, by and among SYNLAB Bondco plc, as the borrower,
Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as arrangers, Natixis, as agent, and U.S. Bank Trustees
Limited, a security agent. See "Description of Other Indebtedness—Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B Facility."

In the event that the number of Target shares held by the Bidder does not meet the Squeeze-Out Threshold, the Existing SYNLAB
Term Loan B is expected to be repaid in part or in full using cash on the Target's balance sheet, proceeds of the Offering and/or
borrowings under the New Term Loan B that are not required to be utilized for purposes of acquiring shares of the Target. Any
such repayment will be facilitated by a shareholder loan from the Issuer to SYNLAB Bondco PLC on terms acceptable to the
Target. As a result, the amount of borrowings under the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B on an "as adjusted" basis would be
expected to be lower if the Squeeze-Out Threshold is not met, and as a result the "as adjusted" total senior secured debt and "as
adjusted" total financial debt would be lower by a corresponding amount. For example, if the Bidder acquires the 41.9% of the
share capital of the Target that it does not currently own, but has been tendered in the Acquisition Offer or is subject to coinvestment agreements or irrevocable undertakings as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, and as a result will own 84.7%
of the share capital of the Target following the Acquisitions, it is anticipated that the €385.0 million of outstanding borrowings
under the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B would be repaid in full, in which case "as adjusted" Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B
borrowings outstanding would be nil, reflecting an adjustment of €(385.0) million. If the Bidder's ownership is above 84.7% of
the share capital of the Target, but remains below the Squeeze-Out Threshold, the amount of the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B
repayment will vary and the "as adjusted" total senior secured debt and "as adjusted" total financial debt will vary by a
corresponding amount.

(6) Represents the expected aggregate amount of New Term Loan B borrowings under the 2023 Term Loan Facilities. See
"Description of Other Indebtedness—2023 Term Loan Facilities." Concurrently with the Offering, the Issuer is syndicating the
New Term Loan B. On the pricing date for the Notes, the Issuer expects to allocate an aggregate amount of up to €1,450.0 million
of senior debt consisting of the Notes and the New Term Loan B. The final allocation between the Notes and the Term Loan B is
subject to final determination on the pricing date for the Notes based on market conditions.

(7) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby.

(8) Represents current and non-current lease liabilities as of September 30, 2023, as reflected on the Target's statement of financial
position included in the Interim Financial Statements.

(9) Represents adjustments to the Target's aggregate lease liabilities to exclude operating leases from its calculation of total financial
indebtedness, as permitted under the terms of its financing agreements.

(10) Represents €500.0 million of long-term PIK Notes to be issued by Ephios Subco 1 on or prior to the Completion Date. The
proceeds of such PIK Notes will be advanced as shareholder loans by Ephios Subco 1 through Ephios Subco 2, the Issuer and
Ephios Bidco to the Bidder. On or prior to the Completion Date, the Bidder will transfer shares of €500.0 million in the Target in
full payment of the corresponding shareholder loan.

(11) The actual column represents the total book value of equity of the Target as of September 30, 2023. The "as adjusted" column
represents the equity value of the Issuer on a pro forma basis for the Transactions, assuming that the Bidder will acquire 100% of
the Target shares in the Transactions. In the event that the number of Target shares held by the Bidder does not meet the SqueezeOut Threshold, it is anticipated that the "as adjusted" total equity value of the Issuer will vary with the difference representing the
funds required to purchase Target shares. For example, if the Bidder acquires the 41.9% of the share capital of the Target that it
does not currently own, but has been tendered in the Acquisition Offer or is subject to co-investment agreements or irrevocable
undertakings as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, and as a result will own 84.7% of the share capital of the Target
following the Acquisitions, it is anticipated that total equity will be €1,277.0 million, with the €341.0 million difference
representing additional funds that would not be utilized to purchase Target shares in such scenario. If the Bidder's ownership is
above 84.7% of the share capital of the Target, but remains below the Squeeze-Out Threshold, the amount of total equity will
vary.

(12) Total capitalization is calculated as the sum of total financial debt and total shareholders' equity. In the event that the number of
Target shares held by the Bidder does not meet the Squeeze-Out Threshold, total capitalization is expected to be lower than the
€3,810.0 million indicated in the table above for the reasons noted above, including the lower amount of debt resulting from the
partial or full repayment of the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B discussed in footnote (5) above and the higher total equity
discussed in footnote (11) above. For example, if the Bidder acquires the 41.9% of the share capital of the Target that it does not
currently own, but has been tendered in the Acquisition Offer or is subject to co-investment agreements or irrevocable
undertakings as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, and as a result will own 84.7% of the share capital of the Target
following the Acquisitions, it is anticipated that total capitalization will be €3,766.0 million. If the Bidder's ownership is above
84.7% of the share capital of the Target, but remains below the Squeeze-Out Threshold, the amount of total equity will vary.

_disclaim any association with, the forward-looking statements._

**Overview**

We are the leader in medical diagnostic services and specialty testing in Europe. We offer a full range of
innovative and reliable medical diagnostics to patients, practicing doctors, hospitals and clinics,
governments and corporates. Providing the leading level of service within the industry, we are the partner
of choice for routine and specialty diagnostics in human medicine. We continuously innovate medical
diagnostic services for the benefit of patients and customers. We are present in 33 countries across five
continents and hold leading positions in most markets, regularly reinforcing the strength of our network
through a proven acquisition and portfolio optimization strategy, while remaining focused on diligent cost
control through initiatives such as our "SALIX" (Scale, Alignment, Leverage, Instruction, X-check)
operational excellence program. More than 27,000 employees, including over 2,000 medical experts,
contribute every day to our worldwide success as we perform around 600 million laboratory tests per year.

Our business is well-positioned to take advantage of the growing market for clinical laboratory and medical
diagnostic services in Europe, which benefits from favorable structural trends, including an aging
population, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, a growing focus on disease prevention, increasing
outsourcing of clinical laboratory testing by hospitals and an additional need for advanced testing.

We have been a pioneer in the consolidation trend in the European clinical laboratories market. Our
expansion strategy is focused on adapting to local market environments while drawing from the strength of
our pan-European support functions. Our market position and the scale of our laboratory network also allow
us to benefit from favorable procurement conditions with suppliers, including through group-wide panEuropean framework supply agreements for reagents and equipment. Major parts of the European clinical
laboratory and medical diagnostic services market remain fragmented, providing further meaningful
opportunities for continued expansion.

Our SALIX program consists of efficiency-enhancing and cost-savings initiatives relating to laboratory
centralization; group-wide logistics management; and the optimization of staffing of laboratories and blood
collection points. The SALIX program addresses all three of our primary cost groups (i.e., materials,
personnel and other operating expenses). Having been implemented in 2017, with the first savings achieved
in 2018, SALIX has generated approximately €140 million in total savings, including approximately
€25 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 and approximately €30 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, with further ongoing savings expected over the medium term.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded revenue of €2,691.1 million, with net profit
(group share) amounting to €130.0 million. Our _Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA was_
€455.6 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, amounting to 17.6% of our revenue for
the period. For a reconciliation of net profit to Adjusted Operating Profit and Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted
EBITDA, see "Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data."


-----

**Principal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

You should consider the following factors when analyzing our financial condition and results of operations.

**_Demand for Laboratory Tests_**

Our revenue growth is directly linked to the volume of tests we perform, which is dependent on general
economic conditions and a number of other factors, including demographic trends, such as the aging of the
population and the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, like cancer and diabetes that require recurrent
tests. Testing volumes have also increased as the medical profession has shifted its focus over time from
the treatment of chronic and severe illnesses to the prevention and early detection and diagnosis of such
illnesses. This shift has been supported by growing demand for customized healthcare solutions and the
potential for preventive medicine to reduce medication and hospitalization costs. In doing so, physicians
are also increasingly relying on clinical testing for more accurate diagnoses.

Other factors, such as the development of new technologies and tests, combined with the reduction in costs
from increased automation of testing, have increased the role of clinical testing. In addition, outsourcing of
specialty tests from hospital laboratories has also increased in many countries where we operate, due mainly
to budgetary pressures and public spending cuts. The overall greater health consciousness of the general
public along with increased disposable income contribute to both volume growth and a willingness of
certain patients to absorb out-of-pocket costs.

**_Tariffs and Reimbursement Levels for Clinical Laboratory Testing_**

In many of the countries where we operate, clinical laboratory testing services are delivered to patients
under government healthcare programs that are at least partly funded by public organizations that directly
set prices or provide a mandated method for determining prices covering all or some of the clinical
laboratory testing services that we offer. Prices may be changed at any time, and, while some prices have
risen in certain countries in recent years, the more common trend has been for price revisions to result in
price reductions to counterbalance growth in test volumes. We do not expect widespread price increases
for clinical laboratory services in the short or medium term as governments seek to control healthcare
expenditure. In addition to cutting prices or reimbursement levels, governments have also sought to reduce
the number of tests prescribed by doctors and limit the testing services covered by their health and social
security programs. Price pressures on underlying activities were lifted in certain regions and countries due
to the increased budgets for diagnostics and prevention or due to the impact of the lockdowns on actual
government budget consumption for routine testing. The transfer of public service to private providers
(outsourcing) increased in certain markets, broadening the addressable market for private providers.

In other markets where we operate, healthcare patients rely on private insurance to pay medical bills, but
the pricing of medical services is regulated by the state. In such markets, tariffs are set by governments and
healthcare authorities and are the basis for the prices we charge to our clients. The timing of tariff cuts and
other measures related to the control of healthcare expenditure may affect the comparability of our financial
results and the scope of the impact on a particular period or in a particular country.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, nearly all of our revenue from human medicine in our core market
countries of France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom was generated from services for which prices
are directly or indirectly regulated by governmental authorities. The average reimbursement levels for
laboratory tests vary significantly from one country to another. In certain markets or segments of our
markets, such as in Spain, prices may be freely negotiated. For our B2B business, pricing for services
provided at the request of prescribers and physicians is more commonly regulated, while pricing for hospital
laboratory outsourcing and laboratory-to-laboratory services is usually more flexible. Our B2C business is
also partially subject to regulated pricing, while our D2C services generally can be flexibly priced.
Accordingly, our B2B business, which includes business with hospitals, typically has lower margins than
either B2C or D2C, both of which allow us to have a direct relationship with the patient and capture a higher
proportion of the value.

We must also contend with efforts by non-governmental third-party payers (mainly private health insurers)
to control the utilization and reimbursement of clinical laboratory testing services. In certain markets, we
receive payment for our services from private health insurers that have gained significant bargaining power
by reimbursing healthcare services only if such services are provided by pre-selected providers. These
private health insurers negotiate fee structures with healthcare providers, including clinical laboratories,


-----

and certain private health insurers have insisted on discounted fee structures as a condition for pre-selection
in the past and may insist on further discounted fee structures in the future.

We are also exposed to the impact of general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate on
tariffs and reimbursement levels for clinical laboratory testing. Lower government, third-party payer and
patient healthcare expenditure would generally be expected to have a negative impact on our results of
operations, but difficult economic conditions can alternatively have a positive impact on the outsourcing of
clinical laboratory testing insofar as the roll-out of cost-cutting or deficit reduction plans may prompt
companies or public-sector institutions to outsource clinical testing services more rapidly and to a greater
extent. Price cuts may, for example, be offset by volume growth owing to an increase in the number of
patients relying on private healthcare plans. We believe that there is a trend that reflects the erosion of trust
in the public health insurance system and a poorer quality of service provided by some public healthcare
systems amid fiscal austerity. We benefit from a broad customer base and a diversity of payers for our
testing services.

**_Influence of the Legislative and Regulatory Environment in which We Operate_**

We are subject to significant regulation and control by various regulatory organizations and must adapt to
frequent legislative and regulatory changes at both national and European levels. These regulations mainly
pertain to operating standards, professional qualifications of laboratory personnel, ownership and corporate
governance constraints on companies operating clinical laboratories, and pricing and reimbursement levels
of clinical laboratory tests. Changes made to laws and regulations in the past have had, and in the future
may continue to have, a significant impact on our results of operations. In particular, compliance by
laboratories with operating standards and the professional qualifications of laboratory personnel may
increase our payroll and related expenses and our administrative, legal and operating costs.

For example, as detailed in "Risk Factors," the Law of May 30, 2013 amended the ownership rules
concerning clinical testing laboratory companies in France, significantly impacting our operations. The
Law of May 30, 2013 may limit our ability to sell or transfer shares in SELs that we hold or that we may
acquire in the future and render more complex any restructuring we might consider for our subsidiaries.
The Law of May 30, 2013 extended the French regional health authorities' oversight of compliance with
the concentration rules in a given geographical region (zone, previously referred to as territoire de santé)
and clarified the fact that the acquisition of shares of companies operating a clinical laboratory is not
authorized when such an acquisition would enable a person or entity to control, directly or indirectly, more
than 33% of all clinical tests performed in the same zone. A person or entity is deemed to control more than
33% of all clinical tests carried out in a zone if they own, directly or indirectly, the majority of the share
capital of several companies operating a clinical laboratory, and the combined business of those companies
represents more than 33% of all clinical tests in that zone. See "Risk Factors—Current or future regulatory
_changes in France, and challenges brought by the competent administrative authorities, professional_
_associations or professional biologists' trade unions, may affect our flexibility, make us more dependent on_
_laboratory doctors to check operations carried out by our French laboratories, and call into question our_
_organizational and legal structure."_

In addition, since the clinical sector is VAT exempt for payers, clinical testing laboratories are responsible
for paying VAT, thereby recognizing operating costs inclusive of VAT. VAT rates, the amount of taxes on
sales and other similar taxes may be increased, especially in the current economic and political climate,
with certain European governments seeking to raise more revenue from direct and indirect taxation.

In addition, deferred tax assets have been recognized to reflect the differences between the carrying amount
of assets and liabilities and their tax base as well as carried forward tax losses from our subsidiaries. Future
recovery of these assets will depend on tax rules, the outcome of the possible tax audits and future results
of the relevant subsidiaries.

**_Expansion of Our Laboratory Network through Acquisitions and Optimization through Selective_**
**_Divestments_**

The European clinical laboratory testing market is highly fragmented. We believe that consolidation of the
European clinical laboratory testing market will allow large international laboratory consolidators like us,
which benefit from high testing volumes across geographic markets, to further expand regional laboratory
clusters, improve efficiency and lower overall cost, and thus mitigate the effect of potential future price
declines and create significant value for our shareholders.


-----

We have a proven track record as an effective consolidator of small- and medium-sized, locally owned
private laboratories and intend to continue to acquire laboratories to expand our footprint in existing
markets, reinforce our scientific expertise and expand into new markets. We have primarily focused on
acquisitions of small- and medium-sized regional laboratories in order to maintain a balance across regions
and strengthen our network in certain countries and enter into new markets that present high growth
opportunities.

From the formation of the SYNLAB Group in the second half of 2015 through September 30, 2023, we
completed 159 acquisitions of laboratories (excluding additional acquisitions in business units that were
sold during that period). The acquired laboratory businesses had a combined enterprise value of
approximately €1.1 billion or an average of approximately €7.0 million per business acquired. In the year
ended December 31, 2021, we completed 18 acquisitions for a total revenue contribution of €204.8 million.
In the year ended December 31, 2022, we completed 23 acquisitions for a total revenue contribution of
€42.0 million. In the first nine months ended September 30, 2023, we completed seven acquisitions for a
total revenue contribution of €22.4 million.

Acquisitions affect our results of operations in several tangible ways. First, our results for the period during
which an acquisition takes place are affected by the inclusion of the results of the acquired business in our
consolidated results. As acquired businesses are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, the full
impact of an acquisition is only reflected in our financial statements in the subsequent period. Furthermore,
earn-out payments linked to our acquisitions may turn out to be significant. In addition to the accretive
revenue and cost impact of acquisitions, we have historically been able to extract synergies and generate
cost savings as a result of acquisitions.

We acquire clinical laboratories with limited property, plant and equipment assets for a consideration that
in many cases exceeds their net assets, which leads to significant amounts of goodwill being recognized on
our consolidated statement of financial position (€2,323.4 million as of December 31, 2022 and
€2,268.6 million as of September 30, 2023). Under IFRS, goodwill is recorded as an intangible asset and
measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is subject to an impairment test
annually and whenever there are indications of impairment. In 2020 and 2022 we recorded significant
impairments in goodwill, including €115.0 million for our Swiss operations in 2020 and €213.0 million for
our German operations in 2022.

Changes in regulation can affect our ability to expand our laboratory network. In the past, such regulatory
changes have only temporarily affected our acquisition strategy in the applicable country without having a
significant impact on our ability to make acquisitions in other markets.

We continuously monitor performance at the level of countries, segments, entity, contract or customer
groups, with a reinforced focus on countries or segments with low margins (less than 10% Adjusted
EBITDA Margin), divesting lower performing assets or assets that can be sold at highly accretive multiples.
We evaluate market structure, degree of consolidation, critical scale required in the market, organic growth
of laboratory testing services in the country and reimbursement and regulation trends. While the most
immediate focus is on assets with Adjusted EBITDA Margins below 10%, we also aim to decrease the
revenue contribution of businesses with margins below 20% (which contributed approximately 52% of our
revenue in the first half of 2023) and look for opportunities to simplify our business model. The completed
sale of our veterinary diagnostics business in Belgium, Germany and Spain in September 2023 and of our
business operations in Switzerland in July 2023, are outcomes of such evaluation. These businesses were
sold for attractive multiples and were margin accretive for the whole Group, with cash inflow from the sale
of subsidiaries, net of cash disposed and changes in debt having amounted to €346 million. The proceeds
have been reinvested and utilized for the purposes of deleveraging (including repaying in full €220 million
of term loan B debt under a facility that was outstanding at the time in July 2023).

**_Demand for COVID-19-Related Testing_**

During the COVID-19 pandemic we proactively worked with the competent authorities and leveraged our
diagnostics capabilities to offer support to health authorities, governments, enterprises, educational
institutions and sports associations in numerous countries with the aim to provide vital services in the fight
against COVID-19. In March 2020, we began providing SARS-CoV-2 tests. For the year ended
December 31, 2021, we conducted approximately 35 million SARS-CoV-2 tests and for the year ended
December 31, 2022, we conducted approximately 20.5 million SARS-CoV-2 tests. In the first nine months
ended September 30, 2023, the number of conducted SARS-CoV-2 tests further decreased significantly as


-----

the emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic ended. The rapid roll out of SARS-CoV-2 tests offset a
temporary decline in our standard routine and specialty diagnostic testing activity that occurred in the early
stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in March and April 2020. At the height of the pandemic in
2021 we generated €1,579.0 million of COVID-19-related revenue. In 2022, we generated €789.0 million
of COVID-19-related revenue, which we expect to further decrease to around €40 million in 2023. In the
first quarter of 2021, COVID-19-related revenue amounted to 46.3% of our total revenue for the quarter, a
figure that reduced to less than 1% of total revenue for the third quarter of 2023.

**_Seasonality_**

Seasonality has limited impact on the volumes of tests we perform and, consequently, in our revenue. We
have historically performed fewer tests during holiday and vacation periods, notably in the summer months,
around the winter holidays and during periods of adverse weather conditions. The extent of the impact of
the seasonality varies among the countries in which we operate and is also affected by the number of
working days in a period. Our working capital requirements generally follow the seasonality of the business
and are typically higher in the first quarter of the year, with fluctuations also occurring due to the timing of
collections and the seasonal effects of payments by our principal customers, in particular public-sector or
public-private organizations, such as INAMI in Belgium and the ASL regional health insurance funds in
Italy, which tend to settle all the amounts they owe for the year on December 31 of each year. As a result,
more cash is required to cover our working capital requirements over the first nine months of the financial
year, while in the fourth quarter we enjoy the benefit of the cash generated by working capital. In addition,
the seasonal effect on cash used as, or generated by, working capital usually tends to increase from one
year to the next as a result of organic or acquisition-led growth in consolidated annual revenue.

**_Foreign Currency Effects_**

We operate in 33 countries throughout Europe, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East. Consequently,
many of our subsidiaries transact business and report financial results in currencies other than euros, which
is our consolidated reporting currency. Accordingly, our results of operations are subject to currency
effects, primarily currency translation exposure as transaction-related exposure at our subsidiaries is limited
because revenue and costs are largely incurred in their respective operating currencies. For those countries
with a functional currency other than euros, income and expense amounts are translated into euros at annual
average exchange rates, and assets and liabilities are translated into euros at the reporting date rates.
Fluctuations in exchange rates against euros will give rise to period-on-period differences in our results of
operations. Our primary foreign currency risk relates to fluctuations in British pounds sterling, Colombian
pesos, Czech crowns and Hungarian forints. See "—Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures on Financial
_Risk—Foreign Currency Risk."_

**Factors Affecting Comparability**

**_Mergers, Acquisitions and Disposals_**

When comparing financial information corresponding to the different financial periods presented in this
Offering Memorandum, investors should take into account the material differences resulting from our
merger, acquisition and disposal activity completed between January 1, 2020 and September 30, 2023 and
the resulting changes regarding the composition of the SYNLAB Group. Because of such effects, the
financial information presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this Offering
Memorandum may not be fully comparable and should be considered in conjunction with the information
below relating to the standalone performance of the businesses that we acquired during this period. Such
performance information has not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors and is based on
certain assumptions, adjustments and estimates. Such information does not reflect the revenue or Adjusted
EBITDA that would have been achieved had the businesses described below been acquired at the beginning
of their respective year of consolidation, given that no such acquired business was under our control until
their respective date of consolidation.

_Changes to the Composition of the SYNLAB Group in 2020_

In 2020, we completed nine acquisitions in Belgium, Colombia, Ecuador, Italy, Portugal and Spain.
Between the applicable dates of consolidation into our financial statements for the relevant acquisitions and
December 31, 2020, acquired entities cumulatively contributed €8.7 million to our consolidated revenue


-----

for the year. Had all acquired entities been fully consolidated for the full year 2020, such entities would
have contributed an additional €7.8 million to our consolidated revenue for the year.

In 2020, we sold our analytics and services business. See "—Sale of Analytics & Services Business Unit"
below.

In addition, in 2020, we completed one disposal in France. Between January 1, 2020 and the date on which
the disposed entity exited the perimeter of consolidation, the disposed entity contributed €0.7 million to our
consolidated revenue for the year. Had the disposed entity been fully unconsolidated for the full year 2020,
our consolidated revenue for the year would have decreased by such amount.

_Changes to the Composition of the SYNLAB Group in 2021_

In 2021, we completed 18 acquisitions, including the acquisition of the Viapath Group (which is now
renamed Synnovis) in the United Kingdom, which was acquired in connection with our successful tender
for the South East London NHS contract and entry into a partnership with Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS
Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. For additional information on the
acquisition of the Viapath Group, see note 4.4 (Acquisition of Viapath Group) to the 2021 Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. We also completed other acquisitions in
Colombia, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico and Spain. Between the applicable dates of consolidation into
our financial statements for the relevant acquisitions and December 31, 2021, acquired entities
cumulatively contributed €204.8 million to our consolidated revenue for the year (of which the Viapath
Group contributed €155.8 million following its acquisition on April 1, 2021 and the commencement of
services under the South East London NHS contract). Had all acquired entities been fully consolidated for
the full year 2021, such entities would have contributed an additional €139.0 million to our consolidated
revenue for the year (of which the Viapath Group represents €42.9 million).

On November 10, 2020, we entered into a sale agreement to dispose of the remaining analytics and services
("A&S") business unit entities, which was completed on December 31, 2020 for all but one entity, the entity
BZH GmbH Deutsches Beratungszentrum für Hygiene, which was not sold in 2020 and was shown as held
for sale as of December 31, 2020. The entity was sold on January 29, 2021. We did not complete any other
disposals in 2021.

_Changes to the Composition of the SYNLAB Group in 2022_

In 2022, we completed 23 acquisitions in Chile, Ecuador, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Spain
and Switzerland. Between the applicable dates of consolidation into our financial statements for the relevant
acquisitions and December 31, 2022, acquired entities cumulatively contributed €42.0 million to our
consolidated revenue for the year. Had all acquired entities been fully consolidated for the full year 2022,
such entities would have contributed an additional €41.4 million to our consolidated revenue for the year.

In 2022, we completed the disposal of our veterinary business in Ireland and the United Kingdom. Between
January 1, 2022 and the date on which the disposed entity exited the perimeter of consolidation, the disposed
entity contributed €10.7 million to our consolidated revenue. Had the disposed entity been fully
unconsolidated for the full year 2022, our consolidated revenue for the year would have decreased by such
amount.

_Changes to the Composition of the SYNLAB Group in the first nine months of 2023_

In the first nine months of 2023, we completed seven acquisitions in Belgium, Germany and Italy, and we
purchased the assets of Royal Brompton & Harefield Hospitals in the United Kingdom. As indicated in
note 3.2 (Acquisitions) to the Interim Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum, our acquisition activity during the period included 14 legal entities. Between the applicable
dates of consolidation into our interim financial statements for the relevant acquisitions and September 30,
2023, the acquired entities cumulatively contributed €22.4 million to our consolidated revenue for the
period. Had all acquired entities been fully consolidated for the full nine months ended September 30, 2023,
such entities would have contributed an additional €18.7 million to our consolidated revenue for the period.

In the first nine months of 2023, we completed multiple disposals. On July 1, 2023, we finalized the sale
of all our Swiss entities to Sonic Healthcare, on August 1 and 2, 2023 we finalized the sale of our businesses
in Poland and Ukraine and, on September 29, 2023, we finalized the sale of our remaining veterinary
diagnostics businesses in Belgium, Germany and Spain to Mars Incorporated. Between January 1, 2023


-----

and the date on which the disposed entities exited the perimeter of consolidation, the disposed entities
contributed €83.9 million to our consolidated revenue for the year. Had the disposed entities been fully
unconsolidated for the full nine month period ended September 30, 2023, our consolidated revenue for the
period would have decreased by such amount.

**_Sale of Analytics & Services Business Unit_**

In 2020, we completed the sale of substantially all of our A&S business unit. Of the 27 entities in the A&S
business unit, the sales of 26 were completed in 2020 and the sale of the 27th A&S entity was agreed in
2020, with the final sale closing in January 2021. The operations of the A&S business unit were classified
under profit for the year from discontinued operations in the consolidated income statement of the 2020
Financial Statements pursuant to IFRS 5 (Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations).

In connection with the sale of our A&S business unit, we entered into a transitional services agreement
pursuant to which we will continue to provide certain services to our former A&S business unit subsidiaries
on a transitional basis. See note 15 (Discontinued operations) to the 2021 Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Had those amounts been included in our results from continuing
operations, it would have resulted in increases of €5.2 million in our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for
the year ended December 31, 2020.

**Description of Key Statement of Comprehensive Income Items**

Set forth below is a summary description of the key elements of the line items of our consolidated income
statement.

**_Revenue_**

We generate revenue from a wide and diverse range of analysis and diagnostic testing services that are
invoiced to a range of customers including insurance companies, hospitals, individuals, pharmacies and
national health organizations. These services include mainly analysis and diagnostic testing services for
human medicine, in particular clinical biological testing, including routine and specialty tests, anatomic
pathology, histological or cytological testing and diagnostic imaging using medical and molecular imaging
technologies.

We apply the principles set out in IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) for revenue
recognition by using the following five steps:

   - Identify the contract(s) with a customer.

   - Identify the performance obligations in the contract.

   - Determine the transaction price.

   - Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.

   - Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

Our contracts with customers are grouped in major revenue streams and their substreams. Our major
revenue streams are via two main channels, a B2B channel, consisting of all services performed for patients
via provision to third-party entities and, a direct-to-patient approach via B2C or D2C channels, where the
patient is in direct contact with SYNLAB and our services. Customers contracted within the B2B channel
include hospitals, prescribers and physicians, laboratory-to-laboratory and corporates. Customers
contracted within the B2C and D2C channels include retail and blood collection points and prevention and
wellness tests, respectively. Activities performed to generate revenue include logistics, analytics and the
provision of a result. Each contract has only one performance obligation since the service promised to the
customer is an analysis and the combined output of the several activities are either not capable of being
distinct or not distinct within the context of the contract.

For the determination of the transaction price, the nature, timing and amount of consideration promised by
a customer are taken into account, and, if applicable, variable consideration, significant financing
components and non-cash consideration. Amounts collected on behalf of third parties are excluded.


-----

Our most significant areas of revenue estimation relate to:

   - revenue recognized based on as yet, unconfirmed public health budgets, where revenue is
estimated based on historical patterns together with other publicly available information
(Germany and Italy being the most significant countries impacted); and

   - accrued revenue based on complete but unbilled tests, where the calculation of the value of
those tests includes a level of estimation based on:

`o` pricing mechanisms as agreed during contract negotiations and used to calculate average
prices;

`o` historical experience; and

`o` actual work performed (e.g., analyses completed).

Based on historical data and experience, these measures are reliable, and the economic benefits associated
with the revenue recognized based on these measures are probable to flow to us.

**_Material and Related Expenses_**

Material and related expenses primarily include the costs of consumables and reagents. Master agreements
in place with clinical diagnostic equipment manufacturers also provide for payments to suppliers based on
the analyses performed on a "per reported result" billing basis. Costs per reported result comprise material
inputs such as reagents, consumables and calibrators as well as, in some cases, allocated service charges
for maintenance.

**_Payroll and Related Expenses_**

Payroll and related expenses consist of fixed and variable salaries and wages, social security contributions
(including pension contributions), other personal related costs (including temporary staffing costs, profit
sharing, bonus payments and premiums), pension contributions, expenses for subcontracting/temporary
staff and share-based payments, travel expenses, fees for training of personnel and food allowances.
Salaries and wages expenses also include the variable remuneration paid to laboratory doctors under various
legal forms, either compensation paid as salary or fees or, mainly for French laboratory doctors, the Priority
Dividends based on current-year profits for the variable portion. The Priority Dividends due to be paid to
certain laboratory doctors in the following year are recognized as employee benefit expense and a liability
in the current year.

**_Other Operating Expenses_**

Other operating expenses mainly include:

   - transportation expenses related to our vehicle fleet and expenses for external logistics
providers;

   - utility expenses including energy expenses, running costs for rental premises, expenses for
security and building observation, cleaning and maintenance;

   - IT and administrative expenses including expenses for hardware- and software maintenances,
IT consulting, network, materials and software licenses;

   - consulting expenses including, among others, expenses for tax and auditing, legal, supervisory
board fees, expenses for accounting and payroll accounting as well as other external
consultancy fees;

   - personnel related expenses including, amongst others, travel expenses, expenses on temporary
workers and training;

   - other taxes, dues and fees consists mostly of non-recoverable VAT and other trade taxes; and

   - other expenses including, amongst others, consolidation loss, penalties and bank charges, prior
period and other expenses, contributions and donations.


-----

**_Other Operating Income_**

Other operating income includes income from foreign currency transactions, rental and lease income,
income from overdue fines and other income.

**_Depreciation and Amortization_**

Depreciation and amortization reflect the normal wear and tear of property, plant and equipment, right of
use assets, amortization of customer relationships and other intangible assets. Amortization of customer
relationships relates to customer relationships recognized as part of the purchase price allocation for
acquisitions.

**_Profit on Disposal of Investments_**

Profits recorded for the disposal of investments relate to the disposal of the A&S business unit in 2020, the
disposal of our Swiss entities and veterinary diagnostics business in Belgium, Germany and Spain in 2023
as well as other disposals.

**_Impairment of Non-Current Assets_**

Impairment of non-current assets includes goodwill impairments and impairments of customer lists, other
fixed assets and non-current assets.

**_Net Finance Costs_**

Net finance costs is the sum of financial costs and income and primarily includes: (i) interest on outstanding
amounts of existing debt, particularly the amounts outstanding on our bonds, revolving credit facility and
bank loans and factoring programs, (ii) interest payable on leases, (iii) gains and losses caused by
fluctuations in exchange rates, (iv) the impact of fair value adjustments on financial instruments held to
cover interest rate risks, (v) the interest cost of post-employment benefit obligations and (vi) income from
cash equivalents.

**_Income Tax Expense_**

Income tax expense includes current and deferred income tax expense. The tax rates and tax laws used to
compute current income taxes are those that are enacted in the countries where the respective Group
companies operate and generate taxable income.

**_Profit for the Period from Discontinued Operations_**

Profit for the period from discontinued operations represents the net results for the period of our A&S
business unit, the sale of which was substantially completed in 2020. See "—Factors Affecting
_Comparability—Sale of Analytics & Services Business Unit."_

The following analysis and discussion is provided by comparing the financial information on a historical
basis from the Interim Financial Statements.

_Revenue_

Our revenue decreased by €559.4 million, or 21.9%, from €2,549.3 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2022, to €1,989.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Taking into
consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in "—Factors Affecting Comparability" above,
the decrease in revenue was principally related to the continuing wind-down of the COVID-19 pandemic
as the World Health Organization declared an end to the global health emergency phase of the pandemic
and SARS-CoV-2 test volumes continued to rapidly decline. The estimated impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on our revenue declined significantly from COVID-19-related revenue having amounted to
approximately €719.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to approximately €37.0 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding the estimated impact of the COVID-19-related
revenue contribution, estimated underlying organic growth of 6.9% was composed of 5.4% of volume
growth and 1.5% of favorable price increases.

Total external revenue in France decreased by €134.7 million, or 25.5%, from €527.8 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2022, to €393.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Taking
into consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in "—Factors Affecting Comparability"
above, the overall decline was principally a result of reduced SARS-CoV-2 testing volumes. Excluding the
estimated impact of the COVID-19-related revenue contribution, estimated underlying organic revenue in
France decreased by 3.1%, largely driven by the decline of price by 4.5%, in line with the three years
agreement with the French health authorities and partially offset by an increase in volume growth of 1.4%.

Total external revenue in Germany decreased by €155.0 million, or 27.8%, from €556.7 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2022, to €401.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Taking
into consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in "—Factors Affecting Comparability"
above, the overall decline was principally a result of reduced SARS-CoV-2 testing volumes. Excluding the
estimated impact of the COVID-19-related revenue contribution, estimated underlying organic growth of
13.0% was primarily driven by volume growth of 13.4% as a result of increase in volume of non-COVID19 related activities, with a slight decrease in prices of 0.3%.


-----

Total external revenue in the South segment decreased by €128.0 million, or 17.2%, from €745.4 million
in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €617.3 million in the nine months ended September 30,
2023. Taking into consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in "—Factors Affecting
_Comparability" above, the overall decline was principally a result of reduced SARS-CoV-2 testing_
volumes. Excluding the estimated impact of the COVID-19-related revenue contribution, estimated
underlying organic revenue in the South segment decreased by 1.0%, largely driven by a 3.0% decrease in
volume that was partially offset by price growth of 2.0%.

Total external revenue in the North & East segment decreased by €141.8 million, or 19.7%, from
€719.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €577.9 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. Taking into consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in "—Factors
_Affecting Comparability" above, the overall decline was principally a result of reduced SARS-CoV-2_
testing volumes. Excluding the estimated impact of the COVID-19-related revenue contribution, estimated
underlying organic growth of 12.5% was driven by a combination of price growth of 6.9% resulting from
price indexation and volume growth of 5.7%. In addition, the North & East segment benefited from
favorable currency effects during the period.

_Material and Related Expenses_

Material and related expenses decreased by €134.0 million, or 22.3%, from €600.7 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2022, to €466.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The
decrease in material and related expenses was primarily due to the lower volume of testing which also
required a lower number of reagents and consumables. Material and related expenses represented 23.5% of
our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to 23.6% in the nine months ended
September 30, 2022.

_Payroll and Related Expenses_

Payroll and related expenses decreased by €40.3 million, or 4.6%, from €881.4 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2022, to €841.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease
was primarily due to the overall lower number of employees as a result of the elimination of positions that
were specifically designated for COVID-19-related functions, and was partially offset by the annual salary
increases and staff hiring related to new activities. Payroll and related expenses represented 42.3% of our
revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to 34.6% of our revenue in the nine
months ended September 30, 2022.

_Other Operating Income_

Other operating income increased by €3.9 million, or 15.9%, from €24.5 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2022, to €28.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was
partially due to our Italian subsidiaries receiving subsidies in the form of research grants relating to our
expertise in nuclear medicine.

_Other Operating Expenses_

Other operating expenses decreased by €41.4 million, or 9.5%, from €435.8 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2022, to €394.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease
was principally due to lower activity levels during the period, as evidenced by the decline in COVID-19related revenue. Other operating expenses represented 19.8% of our revenue in the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, as compared to 17.1% of our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

_Depreciation and Amortization_

Depreciation and amortization remained relatively unchanged, increasing by €1.0 million, or less than
0.1%, from €217.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €218.6 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization represented 11.0% of our revenue in the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to 8.5% in the nine months ended September 30,
2022.


-----

_Impairment of Non-Current Assets_

Impairment of non-current assets decreased by €172.5 million, or 99.7%, from €173.0 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2022, to €0.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 2022
impairment related to an impairment of goodwill relating to our German business, primarily as a result of
the rise in the yield of the 30-year German government bond that increased our weighted average cost of
capital and the high inflationary environment that weakened our business outlook in Germany.

_Operating Profit_

As a result of the factors described above, operating profit decreased by €168.3 million, or 63.4%, from
€265.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €97.0 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2023.

_Share of Loss of Associates and Other Non-controlling Interests_

Share of loss of associates and other non-controlling interests decreased by €1.3 million, or 67.1%, from
€2.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €0.7 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2023.

_Profit on disposal of investments_

Profit on disposal of investments increased by €112.6 million, or 159.4%, from €70.7 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2022, to €183.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The
increase was primarily due to the disposal of our veterinary business in Belgium, Germany and Spain and
Swiss entities.

_Finance Income_

Finance income decreased by €33.7 million, or 42.2%, from €79.7 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2022, to €46.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was
primarily due to changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap and of the embedded derivative, resulting
in lower derivative gains during the period, and from a decrease in exchange profit from realized and
unrealized foreign currency gains from financial liabilities, which were partially offset by higher interest
received on cash deposits.

_Finance Costs_

Finance costs increased by €21.5 million, or 23.5%, from €91.4 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2022, to €112.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was
primarily due to rising interest rates on our floating rate term debt. We repaid €320.0 million of term debt
during the period, which reduced our aggregate amount of outstanding debt, but the majority of such
repayments occurred late in the nine-month period and therefore had a minimal offsetting impact on the
overall increase.

_Income Tax Expense_

Income tax expense decreased by €87.0 million, or 67.1%, from €129.8 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2022, to €42.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was
primarily due to the decrease in operating profit.

_Profit for the Period_

As a result of the factors described above, profit for the period decreased by €22.5 million, or 11.7%, from
€192.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €170.0 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2023.

The following analysis and discussion is provided by comparing the audited financial information on a
historical basis for the year ended December 31, 2021, to the audited financial information on a historical
basis for the year ended December 31, 2022.

_Revenue_

Our revenue decreased by €514.4 million, or 13.7%, from €3,764.9 million in the year ended December 31,
2021, to €3,250.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. Taking into consideration the revenue
impact of the factors discussed in "—Factors Affecting Comparability" above, the decrease in revenue was
principally related to a significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 test volumes and prices as the COVID-19
pandemic was on a downward trend with immunity increasing due to the availability of vaccines. The
estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our revenue declined significantly from COVID-19related revenue having amounted to approximately €1,579.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021
to approximately €789.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Excluding the estimated impact of
the COVID-19-related revenue contribution, estimated underlying organic growth of 6.2% was composed
of 5.6% of volume growth and 0.6% of favorable price increases.

Total external revenue in France decreased by €154.1 million, or 18.6%, from €828.4 million in the year
ended December 31, 2021, to €674.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. Taking into
consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in "—Factors Affecting Comparability" above,
the overall decline was principally a result of reduced SARS-CoV-2 testing volumes. Excluding the
estimated impact of the COVID-19-related revenue contribution, estimated underlying organic revenue in
France decreased by 1.0%, resulting from a 3.2% price decline, partially offset by a 2.2% volume increase.

Total external revenue in Germany decreased by €19.5 million, or 2.7%, from €722.7 million in the year
ended December 31, 2021, to €703.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. Taking into
consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in "—Factors Affecting Comparability" above,
the overall decline was principally a result of reduced SARS-CoV-2 testing volumes. Excluding the
estimated impact of the COVID-19-related revenue contribution, estimated underlying organic growth in
Germany was 1.1%, resulting from due to a 1.4% volume increase, which was slightly offset by a 0.3%
price decline.

Total external revenue in the South segment decreased by €92.3 million, or 8.8%, from €1,052.7 million in
the year ended December 31, 2021, to €960.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. Taking into

consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in "—Factors Affecting Comparability" above,
the overall decline was principally a result of reduced SARS-CoV-2 testing volumes. Excluding the
estimated impact of the COVID-19-related revenue contribution, estimated underlying organic revenue in
the South segment increased by 1.7%, resulting from a 1.4% price increase and 0.3% higher volumes. In
particular, underlying organic growth for our Latin American operations was 2.8%, primarily as a result of
price increases.

Total external revenue in the North & East segment decreased by €248.5 million, or 21.4%, from
€1,161.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to €912.6 million in the year ended December 31,
2022. Taking into consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in "—Factors Affecting
_Comparability" above, the overall decline was principally a result of reduced SARS-CoV-2 testing_
volumes. Excluding the estimated impact of the COVID-19-related revenue contribution, estimated
underlying organic growth of 21.8% was mainly due to the volume growth resulting from ramp-up of our
Synnovis NHS hospital outsourcing contract in South East London, and also included a slight increase in
pricing and driven by inflation indexation mechanisms in many of the North & East countries.

_Material and Related Expenses_

Material and related expenses decreased by €165.5 million, or 17.6%, from €942.4 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021, to €776.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in material and
related expenses was primarily due to the lower volume of testing which also required lower number of
reagents and consumables. For the year ended December 31, 2022, reagents and consumables represented
34.7% and 19.5% of material and related expenses, respectively. Material and related expenses represented
23.9% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 25.0% in the year ended
December 31, 2021.

_Payroll and Related Expenses_

Payroll and related expenses increased by €27.8 million, or 2.4%, from €1,138.9 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021, to €1,166.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily
due to a higher average number of employees which increased from 27,337 to 29,153, which was a result
of increased hiring for COVID-19-related functions during the year. Payroll and related expenses
represented 30.3% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021, which included €2.1 million
related to share-based payments. For the year ended December 31, 2022, salaries and wages represented
65.1% of payroll and related expenses, followed by social security contributions at 20.1%, other personnel
costs (including bonus payments and premiums) at 8.6% and subcontracting and temporary staff expenses
at 5.9%. Payroll and related expenses represented 35.9% of our revenue in the year ended December 31,
2022, which included €3.6 million related to share-based payments.

_Other Operating Income_

Other operating income decreased by €6.8 million, or 16.0%, from €42.6 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021, to €35.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was partially due
to lower income from foreign currency transactions.

_Other Operating Expenses_

Other operating expenses increased by €50.4 million, or 9.2%, from €546.3 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021, to €596.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily
due to a general increase in operating expenses including IT and administration expenses, utilities (e.g.,
energy expenses), higher consulting and advisory fees and higher transportation expenses. For the year
ended December 31, 2022, IT and administration expenses and utilities were the largest categories of our
other operating expenses, having represented 15.7% and 15.6% of our overall other operating expenses,
respectively, while transportation expenses and consulting and advisory fees represented 15.2% and 12.7%
of other operating expenses, respectively. Other operating expenses represented 14.5% of our revenue in
the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 18.4% of our revenue in the year ended December 31,
2022.

Restructuring and other significant expenses amounted to €22.8 million in the year ended December 31,
2021 but only amounted to €0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. Restructuring and other
significant expenses in 2021 mainly related to the costs of our initial public offering.


-----

_Depreciation and Amortization_

Depreciation and amortization increased by €35.9 million, or 13.5%, from €265.4 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021, to €301.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily
due to higher amortization for right of use assets and an increase in the depreciation of property, particularly
the accelerated depreciation of COVID-19 machinery, plant and equipment as well as, to a lesser extent,
higher amortization of customer relationships. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue
was 9.3% for the year ended December 31, 2022.

_Impairment of Non-Current Assets_

Impairment of non-current assets amounted to €213.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 while
there were no such impairments in 2021. The 2022 impairment related to an impairment of goodwill for
our German business principally as a consequence of the impact of the overall geopolitical situation on our
German business, specifically the rise in the yield of the 30-year German government bond that increased
our weighted average cost of capital and the high inflationary environment that weakened our business
outlook in Germany.

_Operating Profit_

As a result of the factors described above, operating profit decreased by €682.9 million, or 74.7%, from
€914.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to €231.7 million in the year ended December 31,
2022.

_Finance Income_

Finance income increased by €20.7 million, or 31.5%, from €65.8 million in the year ended December 31,
2021, to €86.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher
derivative gains during the period and higher interest received on cash deposits.

_Finance Costs_

Finance costs decreased by €64.4 million, or 38.4%, from €168.3 million in the year ended December 31,
2021, to €103.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a
significantly changed debt profile after the completion of our initial public offering, including lower interest
expenses of €32.8 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2022, compared to €73.3 million in the
financial year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, in 2022, a financial expense of €28.5 million in
relation to financial assets at fair value was recorded in the income statement without a comparable expense
in 2021.

_Income Tax Expense_

Income tax expense decreased by €64.9 million, or 33.2%, from €195.3 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021, to €130.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily
due to lower current tax expenses in the year ended December 31, 2022 due to lower net profits in the
different jurisdictions we operate in.

_Profit for the Period from Continuing Operations_

As a result of the factors described above, profit for the period from continuing operations decreased by
€457.8 million, or 75.0%, from €610.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to €152.5 million in
the year ended December 31, 2022.

The following analysis and discussion is provided by comparing the audited financial information on a
historical basis for the year ended December 31, 2020, to the audited financial information on a historical
basis for the year ended December 31, 2021.

_Revenue_

Our revenue increased by €1,143.7 million, or 43.6%, from €2,621.2 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020, to €3,764.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. Taking into consideration
the revenue impact of the factors discussed in "—Factors Affecting Comparability" above, the increase was
primarily due to volume growth as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and underlying business expansion.
The estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our revenue was an approximately €1,560.0 million
net increase for the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting an approximately €1,600.0 million revenue
contribution from SARS-CoV-2 testing, which was partially offset by an estimated approximately
€39 million attrition impact from confinement measures that temporarily decreased non-SARS-CoV-2
testing volumes below expected volumes. The estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our revenue
for the year ended December 31, 2020 was an approximately €620 to €630 million net increase for the year,
including an estimated attrition impact of approximately €175 to €185 million. Excluding the estimated
impact of the COVID-19-related revenue contribution and the positive impact of lower attrition, estimated
underlying organic growth of 9.6% primarily reflected volume growth and the contribution of our Synnovis
hospital outsourcing contract in South East London.

Total external revenue in France increased by €181.8 million, or 28.1%, from €646.6 million in the year
ended December 31, 2020, to €828.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. Taking into
consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in "—Factors Affecting Comparability" above,
the increase was primarily due to high SARS-CoV-2 testing volumes. Excluding the estimated revenue
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the positive impact of lower rates of attrition, estimated underlying
organic growth of approximately 0.7% was primarily driven by solid volume growth offsetting the
regulatory price decrease as per the three year agreement with the French health authorities, implemented
in the second quarter of the year ended December 31, 2021.

Total external revenue in Germany increased by €142.8 million, or 24.6%, from €579.9 million in the year
ended December 31, 2020, to €722.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. Taking into
consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in "—Factors Affecting Comparability" above,
the increase was primarily due to high SARS-CoV-2 testing volumes, with a peak in activity in the final
weeks of the year. Excluding the estimated revenue impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the positive


-----

impact of lower rates of attrition, estimated underlying organic growth of approximately 1.7% was
primarily driven by good volume growth and limited price decline overall.

Total external revenue in the South segment increased by €253.3 million, or 31.7%, from €799.4 million in
the year ended December 31, 2020, to €1,052.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. Taking into
consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in "—Factors Affecting Comparability" above,
the increase was due to good underlying growth and high SARS-CoV-2 testing volumes. Excluding the
revenue impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the positive impact of lower rates of attrition, underlying
organic growth was approximately 4.9% including network expansion, in Italy and Latin America.

Total external revenue in the North & East segment increased by €565.9 million, or 95.1%, from
€595.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, to €1,161.1 million in the year ended December 31,
2021. Taking into consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in "—Factors Affecting
_Comparability" above, the increase was due to good underlying growth and high SARS-CoV-2 testing_
volumes and a strong growth in the United Kingdom. Excluding the estimated revenue impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic and the positive impact of lower rates of attrition, estimated underlying organic
growth of approximately 33.7% was primarily driven by our Synnovis hospital outsourcing contract in
South East London, positive pricing and the "For You" growth initiatives. Key "For You" growth initiatives
included blood collection point openings in Belgium, connecting with doctors in Austria and web services
in the Nordic countries.

_Material and Related Expenses_

Material and related expenses increased by €257.9 million, or 37.7%, from €684.5 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020, to €942.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in material and
related expenses was primarily due to testing volume growth, and was partially offset by €9.0 million in
savings from the SALIX program, in addition to the core laboratory equipment renewal project and
delivering cost efficiencies for PCR test reagents. Material and related expenses represented 25.0% of our
revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 26.1% in the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Payroll and Related Expenses_

Payroll and related expenses increased by €230.7 million, or 25.4%, from €908.2 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020, to €1,138.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily
due to increases in salaries and wages, as well as social security contributions. Payroll and related expenses
represented 30.3% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021, which included €2.1 million
related to share-based payments. Payroll and related expenses represented 34.6% of our revenue in the year
ended December 31, 2020, which included €3.6 million related to share-based payments.

_Other Operating Income_

December 31, 2020, to €42.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily
due to an increase in grants and state aid for COVID-19.

_Other Operating Expenses_

Other operating expenses increased by €155.5 million, or 39.8%, from €390.8 million (for comparative
reasons including Restructuring and other significant expenses and acquisition-related (income)/expenses
previously disclosed separately) in the year ended December 31, 2020, to €546.3 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases in transportation expenses, IT and
administration expenses, utilities and other expenses. Other operating expenses represented 14.9% of our
revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020. Other operating expenses represented 14.5% of our revenue
in the year ended December 31, 2021.

Restructuring and other significant expenses increased by €5.7 million, or 33.2%, from €17.1 million in the
year ended December 31, 2020, to €22.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. Restructuring and
other significant expenses mainly includes expenses for strategic Group projects amounting to
€21.3 million and relate to the costs in connection with our initial public offering in April 2021.


-----

Acquisition and disposal related items expenses increased by €5.2 million, or 275.9%, from €1.9 million in
the year ended December 31, 2020, to €7.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was
primarily due to our increased acquisition activities.

_Depreciation and Amortization_

Depreciation and amortization increased by €39.1 million, or 17.3%, from €226.2 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020, to €265.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily
due increased amount of amortization in the right of use assets and other intangible assets. Depreciation
and amortization as a percentage of revenue was 7.0% for the year ended December 31, 2021.

_Impairment of Non-Current Assets_

Impairment of non-current assets decreased from €115.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 to
nil in the year ended December 31, 2021.

2020, to €65.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to beneficial
changes in the fair value of financial instruments.

_Finance Costs_

Finance costs decreased by €40.6 million, or 19.4%, from €208.9 million in the year ended December 31,
2020, to €168.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a
combination of lower borrowings and lower borrowing costs.

_Income Tax Expense_

from €259.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, to €627.5 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements
of its business operations, including working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures,
contractual obligations and other commitments, as well as acquisitions.


-----

Our financial condition and liquidity are and will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors,
including:

  - our ability to generate cash flows from our operations;

  - the level of our outstanding indebtedness and the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, and the interest
we are obligated to pay on such indebtedness, which affects our net financial expense;

  - our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to continue to borrow funds from financial
institutions; and

  - our external growth funding requirements, which consist primarily of the funding of acquisitions
of laboratories.

Our primary cash requirements consist of funding acquisitions, our working capital requirements and
capital expenditure needs; servicing our indebtedness and the indebtedness of our subsidiaries; and
operating activities and paying taxes.

Our principal source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is expected to be cash generated from our operating
activities. We will also have access to the New Revolving Credit Facility, which is undrawn as of the date
of this Offering Memorandum and is described in further detail under "Description of Other Indebtedness—
_New Revolving Credit Facility." In addition, our ability to generate cash depends on our future operating_
performance, which, in turn, depends to some extent on general economic, financial, industry and other
factors, many of which are beyond our control. See "Risk Factors."

_Cash Flow from Operating Activities_

Cash flow from operating activities increased by €491.3 million, or 94.4%, to €1,011.7 million in the year
ended December 31, 2021, from €520.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was
primarily attributable to profit growth as a result of the volume of SARS-CoV-2 tests that we conducted in
2021 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.


-----

Cash flow from operating activities decreased by €382.1 million, or 37.8%, to €629.6 million in the year
ended December 31, 2022, from €1,011.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was
primarily attributable to a wind-down of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cash flow from operating activities decreased by €326.7 million, or 59.5%, to €222.4 million in the in the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, from €549.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022.
The decrease was primarily attributable to the continuing wind-down of the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Cash Flow from (used in) Investing Activities_

Cash flow from investing activities decreased by €802.1 million, from a cash inflow of €421.1 million in
the year ended December 31, 2020, partly driven by the sale of our A&S business unit, to a cash outflow
of €381.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021.

Cash flow from investing activities decreased by €165.3 million, from a cash outflow of €381.0 million in
the year ended December 31, 2021 to a cash outflow of €215.7 million in the year ended December 31,
2022, principally due to lower cash outflows for acquisitions and the sale of our veterinary business in
Ireland and the United Kingdom for strategic purposes in 2022.

Cash flow from investing activities changed by €286.6 million, from a cash outflow of €97.0 million in the
nine months ended September 30, 2022, to a cash inflow of €189.6 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the disposals of our veterinary business in
Belgium, Germany and Spain and the disposals of our businesses in Switzerland, Poland and Ukraine.

_Cash Flow from (used in) Financing Activities_

Cash flow used in financing activities increased by €842.3 million, or 321.8%, to a cash outflow of
€1,104.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, from a cash outflow of €261.8 million in the year
ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to debt repayment in relation to the A&S
sale and our initial public offering.

Cash flow used in financing activities decreased by €784.3 million, or 71.0%, to a cash outflow of
€319.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, from a cash outflow of €1,104.1 million in the year
ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to the debt repayment in 2021 explained
above.

Cash flow used in financing activities increased by €307.2 million, or 126.4%, to €550.1 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2023, from €242.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The
increase was primarily attributable to the repayment of €220.0 million of term loan B debt.

**Net Capex**

Our acquisition capital expenditure is primarily related to customer lists and associated goodwill from the
acquisitions of laboratories. Our capital expenditures primarily relate to the acquisition of technical
machines and equipment, fixtures, fittings and office equipment (38%), IT (36%), networks such as blood
collection points (16%) and laboratories (10%). We calculate Net Capex as the cash outflow for purchase
of intangibles and property, plant and equipment, net of proceeds from the sale of intangibles and property,
plant and equipment. Net Capex in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2023 and for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was €96.7 million,
€163.1 million, €157.1 million, €143.4 million and €93.3 million, respectively.

**Pensions and Similar Obligations**

Our provisions for pensions and similar obligations amounted to €29.6 million as of September 30, 2023,
as compared to €31.0 million as of December 31, 2022. For a description of our pension obligations as of
December 31, 2022, see note 28 (Employee benefits liabilities) to the 2022 Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Off-Balance Sheet Commitments**

As of September 30, 2023, our off-balance sheet commitments consisted principally of guarantees given
with respect to the Existing Term Loan A and the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B, including pledges over


-----

the shares of certain Group companies, and guarantees given in connection with leasing contracts and sales
of subsidiaries.

Except as described above, we are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are
reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditure or capital resources. See note 18 (Capital commitment and contingencies) to the Interim
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures on Financial Risk**

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that we will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with our
financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Our approach to managing
liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that we will always have sufficient liquidity to meet our liabilities
when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking
damage to our reputation. This planning considers the maturity of both our financial assets, and our
projected cash flow from operations.

Typically, we ensure that we have sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a
period of 60 days, including the servicing of financial obligations. In addition, we maintain a line of credit,
via our Existing Revolving Credit Facility (and, following the Completion Date, the New Revolving Credit
Facility), under which drawings could be made for financing acquisitions or for general financing purposes.
Under these covenants, if we do not respect contractual requirements, this may result in preventing of future
drawing on the undrawn facility.

We monitor our risk to a shortage of funds using a systematic liquidity planning scheme. This scheme
considers the maturity of our financial investments and assets and the projected cash flows from operations.

Included in the interest-bearing loans, the Existing Revolving Credit Facility amounting to €500 million
was undrawn as of September 30, 2023.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market interest rates. The objective of interest risk management is to manage and
control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return. As of September
30, 2023, our main exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relate to the Existing SYNLAB
Term Loan B and the Existing Term Loan A, which will be repaid in connection with the Transactions and
borrowing under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. Following the Transactions, our main exposure to
the risk of changes in market interest rates will relate to the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B, the New
Term Loan B and New Revolving Credit Facility. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes.

Due to our specific interest rate risk position based on floating rate funding structure, risk management
policies require us to monitor interest rate volatility.

**_Foreign Currency Risk_**

We have been exposed to limited foreign exchange risk, given we are mostly present in European countries
which are part of the Eurozone, except for the United Kingdom operations which are exposed to foreign
exchange risk in respect of the British pound, the disposed Swiss operations which have been exposed to
Swiss francs and certain Northern or Eastern European countries. Furthermore, we have subsidiaries in
Latin America, especially in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, and are therefore exposed to foreign exchange
risk in respect of the Brazilian real, the Colombian peso and the Mexican peso. Non-euro denominated total
revenue represented, in aggregate, approximately 30% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31,
2022. As our foreign currency risk is considered as low, no hedging transactions have currently been
concluded to hedge against such fluctuations.


-----

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet
its contractual obligations and arises principally from our receivables from customers and investment
securities. Our primary exposure to credit risk relates to our trade accounts receivables. We limit our
exposure to credit risk by investing mainly in liquid securities with counterparties that have a high credit
rating. Management actively monitors its investments and does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet
its obligations.

Our exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. We have
no significant concentrations of credit risks due to the large numbers of customers and individual
immateriality of amounts due. We have adopted the simplified expected credit loss model for our trade
receivables. We always measure the loss allowance for trade receivables at an amount equal to lifetime
expected credit losses. To measure the expected credit losses, trade accounts receivables have been grouped
based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The computation of expected credit losses
is performed by means of a default risk matrix, which is based on the historical default rates grouped by
trade receivables class and aging buckets. Moreover, reasonable and supportable information (if available
without undue cost or effort) at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of
future economic conditions have been taken into account in the calculations. The amount of expected credit
losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the
respective financial instrument.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions,
undertake estimates and exercise judgment that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the
balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the fiscal period. See note
2.6.2 (Key sources of estimation) to the 2022 Financial Statements. All assumptions, expectations and
forecasts used as a basis for certain estimates within the Financial Statements represent good-faith
assessments of our future performance for which management believes there is a reasonable basis.
Estimates and judgments used in the determination of reported results are continuously evaluated.

The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The
estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions to accounting
estimates applied prospectively.

**Overview**

We are a major player in the medical diagnostics industry conducting our business primarily in Europe,
where we are the largest European laboratory chain by revenue and number of tests, with growing exposure
to Latin America through major presences in Colombia, Mexico, Chile and Peru; we also operate across
the Middle East and Africa, namely Nigeria and Ghana.

**_Diagnostic Services Sector_**

The diagnostic services sector comprises businesses and laboratories that offer analytic or diagnostic testing
services including clinical biological testing (both routine and specialty), anatomic pathology testing (both
histological and cytological samples) and diagnostic imaging (employing medical and nuclear imaging
technologies).

Diagnostic services are a critical factor in medical decisions and increase the efficiency of healthcare
systems, with around 70% of treatment decisions being based on laboratory test results, while only
accounting for 2–3% of healthcare spend. Prompt and accurate diagnoses improve the quality of care and
reduce the ultimate cost of medication and hospitalization. Aided by technological and medical advances,
the healthcare industry's focus is increasingly shifting from the treatment of existing conditions to the
prevention and early detection of medical conditions. This shift, coupled with structural growth trends in
our key markets such as aging populations and a growing prevalence of chronic diseases, as well as greater
reliance on hospital outsourcing, are leading to an increasing reliance on diagnostic testing services and,
consequently, rising demand for clinical laboratory services.

Diagnostic testing is generally organized in three phases: (i) the pre-analytical phase, which consists of
collecting samples and delivering them to the clinical laboratory; (ii) the analytical phase, during which the
test itself is carried out; and (iii) the post-analytical phase, during which test results are sent to the
prescribing doctor and the patient and laboratory doctors validate the results and assist with interpreting the
results. After a patient experiences medical symptoms and engages with the healthcare system, laboratory
services are involved in the critical stages of information gathering (through sample collections and transfer
to laboratory facilities), analysis, information integration and interpretation, and the development of
working diagnoses. Once the laboratory communicates results to physicians or patients, treatment can begin.

**_Market Characteristics_**

We operate in a large and growing diagnostic testing market that in 2019 was estimated at approximately
€200 billion worldwide. Our addressable market, inclusive of COVID-19-related services, grew from
approximately €23 billion in 2018 to approximately €32 billion in 2022 at approximately a 6.7% CAGR,


-----

with the COVID-19 effect strongest during the period from 2020 to 2022. Our addressable market is
estimated to be approximately €28 billion in 2023 and predicted to grow at a 3–4% CAGR to €34 billion
in 2028, primarily driven by volume increases. The market is evenly split between our core European
market countries (Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom), and emerging and other markets, both
segments accounting for €14 billion in 2023. Our core European market is expected to grow at a 2% CAGR
to €16 billion in 2028 while the emerging and rest of the other markets are expected to grow at a 6% CAGR
to €18 billion in 2028. We expect the increased focus and awareness on diagnostics and disease prevention
associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to a rise in accelerated innovation on the provider side,
increase access to diagnostic services across the globe and will result in rising testing volumes in the longer
term, accelerating the existing trends. In addition, new market opportunities arising from precision medicine,
D2C offerings, artificial intelligence and point-of-care testing are estimated to total approximately
€12 billion in Europe, estimated to grow to approximately €24 billion by 2028 at a 14.4% CAGR.

We have a growing presence in Latin America where the addressable market size (excluding the impact of
COVID-19) is expected to increase from €6 billion to €9 billion at approximately a 10% CAGR between
2023 and 2028, where we operate a full spectrum of routine and specialty testing services with business
models and regulations, which vary on a country-to-country basis. Brazil is the largest market in Latin
America at €3–5 billion, followed by Chile at €0.7–1.0 billion, Peru at €0.3–0.7 billion and Colombia at
€0.3–0.4 billion in 2023. The market is expected to expand primarily due to volume growth, as there is
increased demand for private healthcare, supported by increasing affordability for the middle and upper
middle classes across Latin America. While some markets such as Brazil are more consolidated, other
markets such as Colombia, Peru and Chile have a medium to low degree of consolidation in the market
with M&A opportunities for small chains. Foreign currency exchange rates and political instability are key
risk factors across the region that need to be navigated while operating in the Latin America market.

The chart below shows the historical growth of the accessible diagnostic laboratory services market by
geographies in billions of euros.

(1) "South Other" is composed of Colombia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Mexico, as well as Switzerland (which we exited in 2023)

(2) "North & East Other" is composed of Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Ghana, Lithuania, Nigeria, North Macedonia,
Romania, Slovenia, Türkiye and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Poland and Ukraine (both of which we exited in 2023).

The proportion of our revenue generated from emerging markets and countries outside the eurozone has
increased since 2018. In 2018, emerging market countries (namely, Belarus, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the
Czechia, Ecuador, Ghana, Hungary, North Macedonia, Mexico, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Romania, Türkiye
and the United Arab Emirates) provided 12% of our revenue, which was consistent with mature non-euro
countries (namely, Croatia, Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom), which also provided 12% of
revenue. The remaining 76% was provided by euro countries (namely, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia,
Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain). For the nine months


-----

ended September 30, 2023, the revenue contribution of emerging market countries grew to 14%, mature
non-euro countries provided 16% and euro countries provided 69%.

We draw on substantial knowledge and experience when designing our operational models for diagnostic
services. The models differ significantly depending on (i) the structure of local healthcare systems and the
nature of the customer base, (ii) the nature of prescribers, (iii) regulation and (iv) the approach to patient
care, as described below.

**Clinical Laboratory Services Sector in Europe**

**_Overview_**

The overall clinical laboratory services sector in Europe comprises both public and private laboratory
service providers, which collectively offer services across a range of scientific areas, including general
clinical laboratory testing, or testing of body fluids for abnormalities (e.g., blood cell counts, coagulation,
iron levels, cholesterol); microbiology, or testing for the presence of microbiological pathogens (e.g.,
differentiation, antibiotic resistance, influenza tests); anatomic pathology and cytology, or testing of cells
and tissue samples for abnormalities (e.g., analysis of tumor marks, pap-smears); and constitutional
genetics, or testing of genetic material for abnormalities (e.g., analysis of risk factors, analysis of fetal DNA
for mutations).

Clinical laboratory testing is used in all scientific areas and can be broadly divided into routine testing and
specialty testing. Routine clinical laboratory tests are regularly used in general patient care by doctors to
establish or support a diagnosis, to monitor treatment or to search for an otherwise undiagnosed condition.
Routine testing is highly automated, scale driven, and efficiency oriented. Specialty clinical laboratory tests
involve a higher level of complexity than routine tests, are conducted by skilled laboratory professionals
and generally utilize more sophisticated technology, equipment or materials. Due to technological progress
and innovation, the boundary between routine and specialty testing is constantly changing. As certain
specialty tests become processable on automated test equipment, the cost per test falls, allowing the process
to eventually become part of routine testing. In addition, the spectrum of specialty tests continues to expand
through the introduction of new and innovative tests.

The customer base In the clinical laboratory services market Is diverse and spans both the public and private
sectors. Customers include individual patients as well as hospitals, public and private clinics, medical
practices and laboratories, physicians, blood collection points, public health agencies, pharmaceutical
companies, clinical research organizations and companies in connection with occupational health policies,
among others.

The clinical laboratory service market can be grouped into three major business models: B2B, B2C and
D2C. In the B2B model, hospitals, individual general or specialist practices and other laboratories send
samples in for testing through an outsourcing model. We largely operate the B2B model in Germany, Italy
and the United Kingdom. B2C and D2C patients visit a blood collection point. Patients with prescriptions
for specific tests serve as the customers in the B2C model, where the customer has the choice to select a
laboratory service provider. D2C testing also has patients as the customer, but these services are paid outof-pocket and without a prescription. Typically, customers choose blood collection points based on
proximity and quality.

Pricing methods differ across the models, with B2B and B2C pricing largely driven by national regulation
regarding reimbursement, whereas there is greater flexibility in pricing for D2C. Today, most tests are
conducted via B2B and B2C models while D2C constitutes a small minority in our addressable markets.

Depending on applicable law and regulation, diagnostic services are typically covered by statutory health
insurance ("SHI") or private health insurance ("PHI") providers. Other testing services are freely
negotiated, such as under hospital outsourcing contracts, or are paid for out of pocket by patients (if not
covered by their SHI or PHI provider) or other private payers.

Our addressable European clinical laboratory service market, with a current market size of €16 billion, is
expected to grow in the low single digits annually over the coming years. Large parts of the market remain
unconsolidated and there are currently only a few pan-European players. The nature of competition in the
clinical laboratory services sector varies by country, largely due to different market characteristics and


-----

regulatory regimes. The overall market has experienced consolidation in recent years, driven in part by
regulatory changes and perceived potential for value creation. We expect this trend to continue in the future.

In our view, the increasing pressure on governments to reduce healthcare spending is likely to lead to greater
outsourcing of hospital laboratory work which, in turn, will drive further volume growth for private
laboratory operators and increase the portion of the accessible market for private clinical laboratory service
providers like us. We believe that large laboratory networks such as ours will be the main beneficiaries of
this development, due to our ability to leverage economies of scale, greater financial resources and
experience in operating complex hospital outsourcing contracts, among other advantages.

The diversity of healthcare systems in Europe also means that the provision of clinical laboratory services
varies from country to country, particularly in relation to:

- _Density of private clinical laboratories and professionals: The density of private laboratories_
varies across regions and countries in Europe. Countries such France or Italy have a relatively
higher number of laboratories compared to Germany or the United Kingdom. There is also
significant variance in terms of how many qualified laboratory doctors and pharmacists there are
across countries.

- _Regulations: Regulations relating to the qualification of laboratory doctors and laboratory_
personnel, technical conditions for testing, professional independence of laboratory doctors and
conditions for owning, establishing and operating clinical laboratories vary by country. See
"Regulation."

- _Quality standards: In some countries, national or regional regulations require, or in the future will_
require, the accreditation of all clinical laboratories, while other countries accept internal quality
management standards.

- _Pricing of clinical laboratory tests: The prices of clinical laboratory services in most countries in_
Europe are, to a large extent, regulated. Significant disparities in tariffs persist; for example, prices
per test are generally higher in France than in Spain. In countries such as Spain, regulated prices
in private clinical laboratory services have been replaced by contractually negotiated prices with
private third-party payers.

- _Choice of laboratory: Depending on the country, the clinical laboratory performing tests for a_
patient is chosen by the patient, by their doctor or by the patient's health insurance provider.

**_Market Characteristics_**

The medical diagnostics industry, to a large extent, has attractive market characteristics with advantages
for established market participants. Cross-border consolidation among some of the established market
participants is expected and potential penetration of the European sector, by some of the major nonEuropean laboratory groups, cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, only a very limited number of significant
new market participants are likely to emerge organically. This is mainly due to factors such as economies
of scale, regulatory requirements, required technical know-how and reputation that give established market
participants a strong advantage.

Economies of scale exist at multiple stages of our value chain (e.g., for procurement, logistics, test
processing) and for professional training and development, as well as building and maintaining
relationships with customers, regulators and payers. The presence of such economies of scale can be
advantageous to larger players who are better able to benefit from efficiencies in procurement by bundling
volumes across laboratories and geographies, which assists them in adjusting to price cuts. Similarly, larger
players are better able to operate an integrated laboratory model, which utilizes centralized laboratories
combined with geographically dispersed base laboratories and collection centers.

Regulatory requirements and characteristics include a complex variety of pricing and reimbursement
environments, strict quality standards, long-term contracts and complex licensing and accreditation
processes in some countries. Market participants, including us, with enhanced experience in dealing with
the various national reimbursement environments and established relationships with important customers
and suppliers enjoy advantages over new market participants.


-----

Customer churn rates in our market are relatively low, as patients and doctors are satisfied with their
established laboratories with clinical diagnostics convenient and integrated into doctors' daily clinical
practice. This low customer churn constitutes a competitive edge for us and other established market
participants.

In addition, bigger and more established market participants benefit from advantages in attracting and
retaining leading scientists as employees due to their scientific reputation and technical abilities and
capacity to invest in new technologies, in particular with respect to specialized test services. Larger size
allows for more flexibility in identifying and applying advanced technologies and best practices in selected
specialized test segments.

Building a reputation as a reliable, high-quality service provider takes time and may be a potential challenge
for new participants.

**Clinical Laboratory Services Market by Geography**

**_France_**

The French diagnostic laboratory services market is expected to be approximately €9.7 billion in 2023
(excluding COVID-19) of which accessible market for private laboratories amounted to approximately
€4.8 billion (approximately 50% of the total market). The accessible market is expected to grow from
€4.8 billion in 2023 to €5.0 billion in 2028 at a 1% CAGR, with volume growth at a 2–3% CAGR partially
offset by forecasted price declines of approximately a 1 to 3% CAGR. This market grew at a 0.1% CAGR
from 2019 to 2023, below the 1% CAGR from €4.6 billion in 2015 to €4.8 billion in 2019.

The French clinical laboratory services market is highly regulated. It is estimated that more than 80% of
the French healthcare market in 2022 was funded by the French social security system. In France, doctors
prescribe clinical tests for their non-hospitalized patients, who are free to choose the laboratory in which
they are tested. Patients typically choose a laboratory based on proximity to their home or workplace.
Accordingly, presence in high traffic locations and reputation for quality of services are key factors.

Prices for clinical tests are set by a commission consisting of representatives from the Ministry for Social
Affairs, Health and Women's Rights, UNCAM and professional bodies. Tests for which reimbursement is
authorized are included in a quotation grid of clinical tests and quantified by the letter B. The rate for a
specific test is determined by multiplying the value of B and the coefficient allocated to that specific test.
Generally, more specialized and newer tests are initially not included in the quotation grid and thus not
initially reimbursed. Non-inclusion in the quotation grid also means that prices for such tests are not fixed.
The coefficient assigned to each test in the NABM nomenclature list is revised and updated yearly by a
commission including the French social security system and unions.

Depending on the uptake of the test or the therapeutic advantages offered, UNCAM may seek advice from
the Haute Autorité de Santé ("HAS") regarding its inclusion in the quotation grid. HAS will base its advice
on the indications for which the proposed service is assessed, identifying, where appropriate, the population
groups affected; a description of the role in therapeutic strategy; and an assessment of the improvement
offered by the proposed service compared to alternative standard therapeutic approaches based on current
scientific data, notably with regard to the comparative effectiveness of these treatments. The improvement
offered by the proposed service is evaluated for each indication and, where appropriate, population group.

With or without this advice, a commission decides whether inclusion in the quotation grid is merited and
sets the price as determined by UNCAM. This commission consists of six biologists representing the
profession (trade unions) and three UNCAM representatives (each with two votes), and a chairman, elected
by the commission, who has one vote. UNCAM has the final decision on proposing the inclusion of a test
in the quotation grid and submitting its proposal to the minister. If the minister accepts the proposal the test
is included in the quotation grid via advertisement in the Official Journal.

Effective from 2023, the B-factor was cut by 3.7% from €0.27 to €0.26 with the aim to claw back COVID19-related profits from private laboratories. No agreement on a three-year contract could be reached in 2022,
therefore the rates were only fixed for 2023. In July 2023, the four medical biologists unions and UNCAM
agreed on a 0.4% increase in the spending budget for the French health insurance system to laboratories for
the period 2024 to 2026. This implies an approximately 2.6% price cut for the period if a 3% growth in
volume in line with the historical period is assumed. While there had been concern around steeper price


-----

cuts, the expected price cuts for laboratories corresponding to the spending budget were lower than expected.
This demonstrates regulators taking a long-term view on the profitability of the sector and also ensures
smaller market participants are not unduly affected.

In relation to the COVID-19 period, there was a significant growth in testing volumes (particularly SARSCoV-2 PCR tests) from the second quarter of 2020 through 2021. As the pandemic waned, there was a
notable decline in SARS-CoV-2 tests in 2022. Additional volumes in 2022 from the delays during the
pandemic in discretionary surgeries and postponed regular cancer screenings had limited counter-balancing
effect to the decreasing SARS-CoV-2 testing volumes. The catch-up effect is estimated to represent 0.5%
of the volume in 2023. These catch-up effects in elective surgeries and cancer screenings are only temporary
and are expected to end by 2024. From 2025 and beyond, SARS-CoV-2 test volumes as a proportion of the
regular routine test market are forecasted to be limited (3% of total routine tests by 2024).

Being the fourth largest player in France, we are well positioned to benefit from consolidation opportunities
in the French clinical laboratory services market. Several factors drive this consolidation, including the high
number of smaller laboratories in France employing low levels of automation; price cuts undertaken to
offset rising testing volumes, which create an erosion of margins that can be offset by the use of increasingly
large centers; the requirement that all laboratories operating as legal entities be accredited by COFRAC,
which creates substantial financial hurdles and operational constraints for small and independent
laboratories; aging biologists, with approximately 37% expected to retire in the next ten years. These factors
driving consolidation are reflected in the significant decrease in number of private laboratories. It should
be noted that the consolidation trend in the French market is continuing but at a reduced pace given the
rapid growth via buy and build models in the last decade.

**_Germany_**

Germany is the largest clinical laboratory services market in Europe, with a total market value of
approximately €10.6 billion in 2023 (excluding COVID-19), of which accessible market for private
laboratories amounted to approximately €5.7 billion. This accessible market is expected to grow from
€5.7 billion in 2023 to €6.6 billion in 2028 at a 3–3.5% CAGR supported by stable pricing (0% CAGR
estimated) and favorable volume growth of 2.5–3.5% CAGR. This market grew at a 2% CAGR from
€5.4 billion in 2019 to €5.7 billion in 2023, slightly behind the 3% CAGR from €4.7 billion in 2015 to
€5.4 billion in 2019.

With respect to customers, the total German clinical laboratory services market can be divided into an
outpatient sector, consisting mainly of general practitioners, internists and other office-based specialists,
and an inpatient sector, consisting mainly of hospitals. In Germany, general practitioners are responsible
for collecting samples with their own staff, usually nurses or medical technical assistants. In return, they
are free to choose a clinical laboratory to test the sample. General practitioners are allowed to perform
certain tests themselves, primarily basic routine tests. Private practice general practitioners frequently form
laboratory cooperations (Laborgemeinschaften) to perform routine tests. Specialized tests are sent to
clinical laboratory service providers. Working with laboratory cooperations gives clinical laboratory service
providers access to specialty testing prescribed by general practitioners and reduces customer churn.

We benefit from the increased outsourcing of laboratory services by hospitals and have entered into
significant cooperations in the hospital laboratory outsourcing sector. We have the necessary laboratory
and testing capacity, logistics networks, the ability to meet turnaround times and the availability of specialty
laboratory doctors. Agreements with hospitals are freely negotiated and include agreements for full
outsourcing of certain hospitals' laboratory testing (i.e., routine and specialty). Particularly in connection
with efforts to control costs in smaller hospitals, there are further opportunities for outsourcing of laboratory
services of public hospitals in Germany.

Growth in the forecast period is primarily driven by underlying volumes, increased outsourcing share given
cost pressures and relatively stable pricing and minor reimbursement pressure. Underlying volume growth
is driven by demographic trends of aging populations and migration, and the continued move towards
personalized medicine and illness prevention rather than treatment. Furthermore, we have a strong presence
in Southern Germany which has higher margins due to high PHI exposure.

Pricing pressure is expected to be relatively limited in the period to 2028. Reimbursement changes came
into force in 2018, which led to a temporary slow-down but has had no substantial long-term implications,
and prices from 2023 to 2028 are expected to remain in line with the period from 2018 to 2022. Our analysis


-----

indicates that industry leaders expect staffing shortages and energy prices to influence laboratory services
margins. Reform of the statutory scale of fees for physicians (Gebührenordnung für Ärzte, "GOÄ") is
viewed as an unlikely mid-term threat given its political nature and continued delays and potential EBM
adjustments are expected to be relatively minor. While it cannot be excluded that a GOÄ reform would be
agreed upon in the current legislative period (i.e., before 2025), it should be noted that such reform would
require years of implementation following approval. Although unlikely in the mid-term, GOÄ reform could
have a substantial impact with an approximately 10% price cut regarded as feasible, which would affect the
PHI market (20% of total market in 2022).

The SARS-CoV-2 PCR test market grew steeply in 2020 and peaked in 2021 with high volumes and
dropped to steady-state levels in 2023 at approximately €0.2 billion. COVID-19 revenues are forecasted to
be approximately €120 million from 2023 to 2028. Over the pandemic, routine testing volumes decreased
in 2021 and 2022 with this backlog to be cleared over 2023 (backlog equates to 0.5 to 1% of 2023 volumes).
From 2025 and beyond, SARS-CoV-2 test volumes as a proportion of the regular routine test market are
forecasted to be limited (approximately 2% of total routine tests by end of 2023).

The clinical laboratory services market in Germany is somewhat less fragmented than that of other
European countries, with the top five players estimated to have approximately 54% of the accessible market
by revenue in 2022 and the top three players accounting for approximately 41% of the accessible market
by revenue in the same period. We estimate that the remainder of the accessible market consists of
approximately 330 small-to-medium-sized laboratories with a regional focus. As a top three player, we
expect to continue benefitting from consolidation in the market, driven primarily by efforts of the larger
clinical laboratory groups to expand their geographical footprint, increase specialization to improve our
exposure to the profitable specialist customer segment and take advantage of economies of scale in a highly
competitive marketplace. Consolidation is expected to occur at a slower rate than in the past given the small
laboratory market is constantly decreasing.

**_Italy_**

The Italian diagnostic laboratory services market is expected to be approximately €5.6 billion in 2023
(excluding COVID-19) of which accessible market for private laboratories amounted to approximately
€2.9 billion (approximately 52% of the total market). The accessible market is expected to grow from
€2.9 billion in 2023 to €3.2 billion in 2028 at a 2–3% CAGR with volume growth at a 2–3% CAGR,
supported by stable pricing (0% CAGR estimated). This market grew at a 2% CAGR from €2.6 billion in
2019 to €2.9 billion in 2023, ahead of a period of flat growth from 2015 to 2019.

The market growth is driven primarily by underlying volume growth (2–3% per year) caused by the
increasing prevalence of chronic diseases in an aging population and by the increased proportion accessible
to private players through more outsourcing and out-of-pocket spend. Increased out-of-pocket spend is due
to an underfunded national healthcare authority (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, "SSN") and long waiting
times. No major national cuts are expected in pricing although some decrease in reimbursement rates and
budgets over time.

The Italian healthcare system is mainly funded by a mix of public taxes and co-payments by patients. In
2022, public spending accounted for the majority of total healthcare expenditures while private spending
accounted for the rest. Most of the private spending was out-of-pocket payments, with a smaller part paid
by private health insurance payers.

The Italian healthcare system is organized into three levels: national, regional and local. Generally, in the
case of tests covered by the SSN, prior to undergoing any test, a patient must pay a fee that covers only part
of the test's actual cost. The amount of this prepayment varies by region and according to the patient's social
eligibility criteria. The remaining portion of the cost is covered by the SSN or by private healthcare insurers.

The SSN provides guidelines for prices applicable to accredited private clinical laboratories. However,
regional authorities (Azienda Sanitaria Locale, "ASL") have the authority to set local prices above or below
national guidelines. On an annual basis, each accredited private clinical laboratory must sign an agreement
with local authorities that determines the specific reimbursement rules for prices and the total budget
allocated to the laboratory for the year. Once the annual budget has been reached, which generally occurs
in the final quarter of the year, ASLs will no longer, or only partly, reimburse the tests carried out by the
clinical laboratories which requires patients to pay for tests themselves. As a result, reimbursement levels
vary widely from region to region. In the unlikely case that the annual budgets allocated by the ASLs for a


-----

given year are not fully used by the end of the year, a revision aiming to lower such budgets for the next
year is possible.

In Italy, outpatients' doctors prescribe clinical tests and patients are free to choose the clinical laboratory in
which the tests are conducted. Patients typically choose a laboratory based on proximity to their home or
workplace. Large clinical laboratories in Italy typically offer an integrated diagnostic testing service,
providing clinical testing, diagnostic imaging services, ambulatory care and other healthcare services.

No major changes occurred in the Italian diagnostic laboratories market caused by COVID-19 in terms of
market dynamics or regulation. Volumes of SARS-CoV-2 tests were high across 2020 and 2021, with
SARS-CoV-2 testing as a percentage of the accessible market reducing to 2% in 2023. There were small
backlog effects caused by COVID-19 in 2022 and 2023 causing approximately 1% additional volume
growth.

We believe the high fragmentation (with the top three players accounting for approximately 17% of the
accessible market in 2022), the relative decentralization and overall pricing dynamics of the Italian clinical
laboratory services market, present significant further opportunities for consolidation, which we are well
positioned to capitalize on given that we are co-leaders with one other player in the market and have the
broadest business model.

**_United Kingdom_**

The United Kingdom's laboratory services market is expected to be approximately €4.4 billion in 2023
(excluding COVID-19) of which the accessible market for private laboratories amounted to approximately
€0.7 billion (approximately 16% of the total market). The accessible market is expected to grow from
€0.7 billion in 2023 to €1.0 billion in 2028 at a 6% CAGR with volume growth at a 7% CAGR and partially
offset by the forecasted price decreases of approximately a 1% CAGR. This market grew at a 5% CAGR
from €0.6 billion in 2019 to €0.7 billion in 2023, slightly ahead of the 4% CAGR from €0.5 billion in 2015
to €0.6 billion in 2019.

Growth is forecast to accelerate from 2023 to 2025 as the National Health Service ("NHS") works through
and outsources the backlog of tests from the COVID-19 pandemic. During the peak of the pandemic in
2020, non-COVID-19-related volumes dropped by 50–70% and the corresponding pandemic backlog is
forecasted to be €85–95 million in 2023 and 2024. Volume growth will be driven by a larger accessible
share of the market resulting from increased outsourcing due to financial pressures in the NHS.

Clinical laboratory services in the United Kingdom can be either private or public and can be provided as
part of a hospital stay (i.e., inpatient services), or outside of a hospital setting (i.e., outpatient services). The
NHS dominates the total market for clinical laboratory services. The market for private clinical laboratory
services, in which we are one of the major players, consists of outsourced NHS work as well as private
individual, hospital group and corporate spending.

In the current NHS system, the patient sees a general practitioner in the community, then queues at the
public hospital to have his or her blood taken. The taking of the blood may take a couple of hours to be
processed, and the results may take some time to come back. Since 2000, the United Kingdom has moved
to open independent treatment centers ("ITCs"). These ITCs treat NHS patients but are owned and run by
private companies. In turn, these ITCs outsource their tests to a private clinical laboratory provider. The
aim of this is twofold: to help remove the hidden waiting time between seeing the doctor and receiving a
final diagnosis, which in turn helps reduce waiting times for surgery and improves clinical outcomes.

About one-third of independent hospital clinical laboratory work is undertaken from NHS trusts'
laboratories. This has risen due to the development of NHS private patient facilities. The diagnostic testing
for patients in NHS beds and private patients in public hospitals is generally undertaken by the laboratory
that performs the hospital diagnostic testing. In almost all cases this testing is performed in-house by the
NHS trust itself. The remaining proportion of independent diagnostic testing is outsourced to the private
sector. As a cost initiative, the NHS has for some time aimed to decrease spending on diagnostic testing,
with potential outsourcing to the private sector being described since 2008. (Source: Lord Carter of Coles
report).

With growing NHS waiting times and backlog, market participants expect increased outsourcing from NHS,
including working with NHS trusts to develop a partnership model. Our Synnovis partnership with Guy's


-----

and St Thomas' and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trusts in South East London is an example
of a major contract along these lines.

We believe the nascent UK accessible market presents attractive opportunities with increased outsourcing
from NHS and a growing private clinical laboratory services sector. We are the second largest player in the
United Kingdom, with the top two players accounting for approximately 85% of the accessible market in
2022.

**_Other South / Latin America countries_**

In addition to Italy, which is one of our core countries, operations in Spain, Portugal and several high growth
Latin American countries such as Mexico (growing at a 4–5% CAGR between 2023 and 2028), Colombia
(growing at a 4–5% CAGR between 2023 and 2028), Peru (growing at a 6–7% CAGR on a volume basis
and 3–4% on price between 2023 and 2028), Chile (growing at an 8–9% CAGR between 2023 and 2028)
and Ecuador make up the remainder of our South region.

The Spanish laboratory services market is expected to be approximately €2.9 billion in 2023 (excluding
COVID-19), of which the accessible market for private laboratories is B2C-oriented and amounted to
approximately €1.0 billion (roughly 37% of the total market). The accessible market is expected to grow
from €1.0 billion in 2023 to €1.1 billion in 2028 at approximately a 1% CAGR with volume growth at a 0–
1% CAGR supported by stable pricing (0% CAGR estimated). This market grew at a 1% CAGR from
€1.0 billion in 2019 to €1.0 billion in 2023, tracking the 2015 to 2019 period in which growth was flat. We
are the largest player in Spain with the top three players accounting for approximately 20–35% of the
accessible market in 2022, leaving room for consolidation.

The Portuguese laboratory services market is expected to be approximately €0.7 billion in 2023 (excluding
COVID-19), of which the accessible market for private laboratories is B2C-oriented and amounted to
approximately €0.4 billion (roughly 57% of the total market). The accessible market is expected to grow
from €0.4 billion in 2023 to €0.4 billion in 2028 at approximately a 2% CAGR, with volume growth being
the primary driver at a 1–2% CAGR, supported by stable pricing. This market grew at a 1% CAGR from
€0.4 billion in 2019 to €0.4 billion in 2023, in line with the 1% CAGR from 0.3 billion in 2015 to
€0.4 billion in 2019. We are the fourth largest player in Portugal, with the top three players accounting for
approximately 50% of the accessible market in 2022.

We see significant opportunities in emerging markets especially in Latin America. The region is
characterized by a high degree of fragmentation; Peru and Chile are more than 50% unconsolidated and
Brazil and Colombia are 30–40% unconsolidated. Colombia is the main contributor to our Latin American
revenue at 60–65%. While Peru has a slightly stronger growth outlook than Colombia, there is notable
political instability and foreign currency exchange rate risk.

Colombia has been our main market in the Latin American region to-date. In 2023, the Colombian clinical
laboratory services market size is approximately €700–750 million. It is estimated that the accessible
market in Colombia for private laboratories amounts to €300–320 million in 2023.

The Colombian accessible diagnostic laboratory services market is forecasted to grow mid-single digits (4–
5%) from 2023 to 2028 with SYNLAB's underlying market growth likely greater than this given our higher
exposure to the faster growing B2B segment in Colombia (5–6%), while B2C is expected to grow at 2–4%.
Growth is primarily expected to be driven by volumes (3–4% from 2023 to 2028) with prices broadly flat
as a result of private healthcare demand increasing in line with the continued emergence of the uppermiddle class. While the timeline and proposed changes remain unclear, major healthcare reform is
anticipated in Colombia with a particular need to harmonize inpatient versus outpatient reimbursements.
Current prices are based on 2021 tariffs, with industry leaders expecting discounts likely to be updated in
2023 or 2024. In Colombia and across the region, foreign currency exchange rates and political instability
are the key risk factors.

The Colombian healthcare system relies on a mandatory public healthcare system, complemented by
optional private plans. The public system is a contributive system, which is subsidized if coverage cannot
be afforded. Private complementary healthcare includes pre-paid medicine and insurance plans. In 2022,
the share of the population with healthcare coverage under the public healthcare system or a private plan
was estimated to be approximately 99%.


-----

Clinical laboratory services in Colombia are addressed by three main types of players. Integrated (directly
operated) in-house hospital laboratories serve the public healthcare system and are non-accessible to private
operators. Outsourced (operated by third-party providers) in-hospital laboratories address both the public
and private healthcare systems, including privately insured patients that are sent to hospital and in-city
laboratories, and are accessible to private operators. Private in-city laboratories serve the pre-paid medicine
and insurance plan segments and are accessible to private operators. Continued outsourcing trends have
benefited the in-hospital laboratories segment, while the private in-city laboratories segment has benefited
from growth in the number of private complementary healthcare insurance clients.

The Colombian clinical laboratory services market is relatively consolidated. In 2022, the top three players
represented approximately 54—64% of the total market and we are the largest player. Other Latin American
markets are instead largely fragmented, with Peru, where we are the number two player and Chile, where
more than 50% of the market is unconsolidated.

**_Other North & East Countries_**

In addition to the United Kingdom, our North & East segment includes operations in Austria, Belarus,
Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ghana, Hungary, Lithuania, Nigeria, North
Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Türkiye and the United Arab Emirates.

The Swedish laboratory services market is expected to be approximately €0.7 billion in 2023 (excluding
COVID-19) of which accessible market for private laboratories amounted to approximately €0.2 billion
(approximately 28% of the total market). The accessible market is expected to grow at approximately a 2%
CAGR between 2023 and 2028, with volume growth at a 3% CAGR, partially offset by a fall in prices at
approximately a 1% CAGR over the same period. This growth is slightly behind the 3% CAGR in both the
2019 to 2023 period and the 2015 to 2019 period. The Swedish market is largely consolidated, with the top
three providers accounting for approximately 95% of the accessible market in 2022. We are the number
two player in this market.

The Czech laboratory services market is expected to be approximately €0.8 billion in 2023 (excluding
COVID-19) of which the accessible market for private laboratories amounted to approximately €0.4 billion.
The accessible market is expected to grow at approximately a 4% CAGR between 2023 and 2028, with
volume growth at approximately a 3% CAGR and price growth at approximately a 1% CAGR. This growth
is in line with the 1% CAGR in the 2019 to 2023 period and the 2015 to 2019 period. We are the joint
number two player in the Czech market with the widest laboratory coverage in the country. The top three
players accounted for approximately 40% of the accessible market in 2022, leaving significant room for
consolidation.

The Slovakian laboratory services market is expected to be approximately €0.2 billion in 2023 (excluding
COVID-19) and the accessible market for private laboratories is expected to be approximately €0.2 billion.
The accessible market is expected to grow at approximately a 4% CAGR between 2023 and 2028, with
volume growth at approximately a 3% CAGR and supported by price increases of a 1% CAGR over the
same period. This growth is above the 2% CAGR in 2019 to 2023 period and in-line with 2015 to 2019
period. We are the #4 player in Slovakia market.

The Hungarian laboratory services market is expected to be approximately €0.1 billion in 2023 (excluding
COVID-19), of which the accessible market for private laboratories amounted to approximately 50% of the
total market. The accessible market is expected to grow at approximately a 5% CAGR between 2023 and
2028, with volume growth at approximately a 3% CAGR, supported by price increases of approximately a
2% CAGR over the same period. This growth is ahead of the 2% CAGR in 2019 to 2023 period and 2015
to 2019 period. We are the leading player in the market with limited significant competition from other
players.

Excluding the United Kingdom, Sweden, Czechia, Slovakia and Hungary, all the other North & East
countries are estimated to have, on a consolidated basis, an accessible market size of €3.3 billion in 2023,
expected to grow at approximately a 6% CAGR to €4.6 billion by 2028. This also includes operations in
the Nigerian and Ghanaian markets, where the markets are relatively small today, but are experiencing
strong growth. In Nigeria, the accessible market is currently estimated to be approximately €150 million
growing at a 10–12% CAGR between 2023 to 2028, driven by volume growth of a 5–7% CAGR and price
increases of a 4–5% CAGR over the same period. In Ghana, the accessible market is estimated to be
approximately €25 million growing at a 14–16% CAGR between 2023 to 2028, driven by volume growth


-----

of an 8–10% CAGR and price uplift of a 5–7% CAGR. Historically, the Nigerian and Ghanaian laboratory
services markets have exhibited an 8–11% and an 11–15% CAGR.

**Competitive Features**

**_Highly Competitive Market with Ongoing Consolidation_**

The European clinical laboratory services sector is highly competitive, with portions of the sector that
remain fragmented. We expect further cross-border consolidation among certain of our competitors, as well
as increased penetration of the European sector by some of the major non-European laboratory groups
(including, in particular, Quest Diagnostics, Laboratory Corporation of America and Sonic Healthcare). In
the next few years, we expect to see a mix of acquisitions and disposals as players focus further on
optimization. As the largest pan-European player by revenue in our sector, present in growing and resilient
end markets, we believe we are well positioned to continue to lead such consolidation and improve our
competitive position.

The portion of the European clinical laboratory services sector that remains fragmented is subject to a
combination of factors that in our view make it a prime candidate for consolidation, which could benefit
large pan-European players such as us. Those factors include pricing pressure, changing quality standards,
increasingly complex and technically demanding tests and the ongoing industrialization of processes in
order to generate economies of scale and reduce costs. Consolidation could increase the market share of
medium- and large-scale laboratory groups, allowing them to leverage their pre-existing footprint and
established levels of expertise and could accelerate the expansion of large competitors in the European
market.

**_Selection Criteria_**

Laboratory selection can be determined by the healthcare provider, the insurance company or directly by
the patient. Patients who are free to select where they are tested usually base their decision on a laboratory's
proximity to their home or workplace.

Other clients, mostly doctors, hospitals and other healthcare providers, consider the following factors,
among others, in selecting a clinical laboratory: accuracy; timeliness and consistency in reporting test
results; reputation of the clinical laboratory in the medical community or field of specialty; quality of advice
and medical value added by the laboratory, number and type of tests performed; method of delivering and
publishing results; and tools available for interpreting results. Price is also a key factor in the hospital
outsourcing market and unregulated sector.

On an individual basis, our clinical laboratories compete with independent clinical laboratories, hospitalbased laboratories (both privately and publicly owned) and doctor office laboratories. At a Group level, our
laboratories compete with other national, European and international groups.

**_Regional, National, European and Global Clinical Laboratory Groups_**

European clinical laboratories have been undergoing a process of consolidation over the past three decades.
Certain national laboratory groups emerged between 1995 and 2005, such as Labco, Cerba and Biomnis in
France, Unilabs in Switzerland, and General Lab and Echevarne in Spain. Since 2006, these groups began
consolidating into European groups.

Investment funds have also shown an increased interest in the healthcare industry, and more particularly in
the clinical laboratory services market. This is likely to continue to accelerate market consolidation and the
integration of pan-European groups. Examples include EQT and PSP's investment in Cerba in March 2021
and CDPQ's investment in Biogroup in October 2018. An early example was Apax and Nordic Capital's
2007 investment in Unilabs, which now has a pan-European presence, operating in 16 European countries
including France, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal and the United Kingdom.

Nonetheless, a number of leading independent national groups remain in Europe, such as, Bianalisi in Italy,
Viollier in Switzerland and Echevarne in Spain. In addition, in a number of countries, and in particular in
France, there has been an emergence in the recent past of groups organized at a regional level, which are
among our main competitors in their particular regional markets.


-----

The consolidation in Eastern Europe is increasing with the formation of pan-European groups such as
Medicover-Synevo, which is present in eleven countries.

Sonic Healthcare, a listed Australian group, is an international player in the clinical laboratory services
sector, with operations in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland,
Ireland and the United Kingdom. Eurofins Scientific is also among the five largest European players with
its presence in twelve countries (with approximately 40–50% of its revenue generated in France).

**_COVID-19 Pandemic_**

Clinical diagnostic services market participants, including us, were at the forefront of the fight against
COVID-19, having leveraged our scale and agility to react quickly to the evolving market demands and
significantly expanded capacities for testing to address the challenges. Market participants, including us,
ramped up capacity at existing sites, established COVID-19 centers of excellence, and in some cases built
new purpose-built facilities dedicated to SARS-CoV-2 testing. Following the discovery and dissemination
of vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 testing peaked in 2021 and has reduced since then.

2022 served as a heterogenous year for COVID-19. It was necessary for clinical laboratory players to work
at high intensity during the first quarter given the Omicron wave. We worked hard during this period to
deliver the full spectrum of testing including testing based in hospitals to mass testing in schools. Following
this period and over the course of 2022, there was a shift to the coexistence with the virus. In 2023, as
COVID-19 waned, we have seen the return of ordinary course laboratory testing volumes to pre-COVID19 levels with some backlog captured in 2023 and the remainder expected to be captured by 2024.

We believe testing plays a key role and remains a core pillar of national responses for any such future
infectious diseases and expect demand for our PCR testing services to be relevant. Increased awareness of
testing following the COVID-19 pandemic and focus on prevention, support the acceleration in existing
trends.

**_Sector Trends and New Market Opportunities_**

There are a number of key trends that we expect will impact the clinical laboratory services sector in Europe
generally and our business specifically. Because clinical testing is an important healthcare service and due
to the key trends discussed below, we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the medium and
long term.

_Demographics_

We expect that demographic trends and changes in lifestyles will lead to increased demand for, and
consequently increased volumes of clinical testing. These trends include the aging population, the increased
frequency of soft diseases (such as allergies) and long-term diseases (such as cancer and diabetes) requiring
recurring tests, as well as an increased focus on preventive healthcare. Healthcare policies also increasingly
recognize the value of early detection and prevention of chronic and severe diseases. The growing emphasis
placed on more accurate diagnoses supported by clinical testing has led doctors to increasingly utilize
clinical laboratory tests to help identify potential diseases, detect illnesses early, monitor patient compliance,


-----

and determine and evaluate treatment. We also believe there will be a growing demand for customized
healthcare solutions as well as preventive medicine as a means to reduce costs.

Further, we believe that higher disposable income and an increased willingness to absorb out-of-pocket
costs could contribute to volume growth. At the same time, the impact of certain lifestyle choices, such as
low levels of physical activity, malnutrition and stress, can lead to obesity and related chronic illnesses,
which in turn may lead to additional testing.

_Pricing Conditions_

In recent years, direct tariff reductions enacted to counterbalance increased volumes and broader health
system reforms have placed downward pressure on prices for clinical laboratory services in some countries.
Pressure on state budgets has also contributed to reductions in tariffs that can be legally charged for testing
as governments and public authorities as well as third-party payers and private insurers have focused on
controlling healthcare costs. In certain countries, public reimbursement levels are regularly updated. We
expect that efforts to limit the rate of growth in healthcare expenditure will generally result in further
reductions in regulated tariffs in the future.

While pricing pressure was an integral part of operating in the European clinical laboratory services sector
in the past, we have seen sustained positive pricing development especially in South and North & East
regions over the last six quarters (especially since COVID-19). Price pressure is higher for automated
routine tests than for specialty tests, which mitigates the overall impact of price pressure for companies that
offer both routine and specialty testing.

In France, a one-off adjustment to the B-letter coefficient was made in 2023 resulting in a blanket price cut
of 3.7% to claw-back some of the windfall received during COVID-19 testing. Speculation that regulators
could stipulate further steep cuts to reimbursement for the 2024 to 2026 period proved not to be the case.
The July 2023 spending budget price cuts for laboratories were lower than expected. The four medical
biologists unions and UNCAM agreed on a 0.4% increase in the spending budget for the French health
insurance system to laboratories for the period 2024 to 2026. This implies an approximated 2.6% price cut
if a 3% growth in volume is assumed in line with the historical period. Regulators typically take a longterm view on the profitability of the sector and ensure smaller market participants are not unduly affected.
We have not seen this dynamic in other geographies where market participants are broadly seen as
contributing to the overall healthcare system.

_Subcontracting and Outsourcing_

Subcontracting and outsourcing by public and private hospital laboratories to the benefit of private
organizations is another trend observed in the European clinical laboratory services sector over the last few
years, driven in particular by hospital operators' desire for productivity gains. We believe subcontracting
and outsourcing will potentially represent a growing source of income for us and similarly situated groups.
This trend is not uniformly present in all European countries. It is currently most prevalent in Germany and
Spain, especially in the private hospital sector and with hospitals run by churches or trusts. In the United
Kingdom, NHS hospitals, faced with tight budget restrictions, are increasingly outsourcing their clinical
laboratory services to private groups.

Our partnership agreement with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital
NHS Foundation Trust in the United Kingdom exemplifies this trend well. The contract for the provision
of pathology services to both trusts was won in 2020 with a duration spanning over 15 years with the option
to extend for a further five years. This joint venture facilitates the opportunity to grow further by winning
additional contracts with NHS trusts in the surrounding area and enhancing our reputation in order to win
tenders elsewhere in the United Kingdom.

_Integration and Streamlining of Laboratory Workflows_

Growing demand for increased efficiency and electronic delivery of laboratory data continue to drive
integration, automation and process improvement within the clinical laboratory services market. Clinical
laboratory service providers continue to automate patient service workflows and laboratory processing in
addition to further integrating patient health records and expanding online access to test results.


-----

_Precision Medicine_

Medical practice has entered a period of profound change, moving from curative medicine to precision
medicine that is personalized, predictive, preventive and participatory. Precision medicine involves the
customization of medical decisions and treatments as well as products individually tailored to patients.
Clinical laboratory testing will play a key role in the development of precision medicine as therapies rely
on biomarkers and require regular testing. The acceleration in the development of precision medicine has
been made possible by profound changes in biological and medical research which have opened the way to
a considerable expansion of the application of clinical testing in diagnostics. In addition, new opportunities
in prevention and in the efficient targeting of treatments should create significant cost savings for healthcare
systems, on a scale that would affect the selection of policies that accelerate the expansion of diagnostic
activities.

This transformation has been driven by the development of new techniques that give access to a substantial
amount of data on individuals. Progress in DNA sequencing has had a particularly meaningful impact and
has become the main driver of the development of molecular diagnostics. The methods available have
diversified, with polymerase chain reaction and high-speed next generation sequencing, which allow for
more targeted testing and analysis, including the sequencing of an entire genome, at a considerably quicker
pace and at a lower cost. We expect to witness an increase in the demand for and use of sequencing in
medical diagnostics.

Technical progress in sequencing is moving along with a better understanding of biological mechanisms.
For instance, based on the observation that fragments of fetal DNA circulate freely in maternal blood during
pregnancy, progress in sequencing has made it possible to develop non-invasive prenatal tests for Down's
Syndrome using maternal blood. We believe that a number of other genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis
and spinal muscular atrophy, may be able to be detected through molecular biology from a sample of
maternal blood. Similarly, it is now possible to identify the genetic changes that make tumors malignant,
through analysis of the tumor genome, allowing for a greater role for clinical testing in the field of oncology.

More generally, these developments in molecular biology, combined with the identification of new
biomarkers for different diseases, as well as new tests for allergies and nutritional biology, are likely to lead
to an expansion of the portfolio of tests carried out in our most sophisticated laboratories. The market for
precision medicine is projected to grow from €3 billion in 2023 to approximately €5 billion in 2028 at an
11% CAGR.

_Direct-to-Consumer_

The diagnostic testing services market has experienced a growing trend for patients to take control of their
own health, which creates new market opportunities for D2C services for the increasing use of diagnostics
to measure a number of metrics. The D2C trend includes not only lifestyle monitoring and prevention, such
as physical well-being, cardiovascular health and fertility, but also includes self-administered testing for
infectious diseases such as HIV or COVID-19, and at-home tests for detecting the use of drugs and alcohol.
Players today are focused on web-shop, providing strong online support/services to ensure good customer
experience and journey. On the back of these drivers, the European D2C market is expected to grow from
less than €1 billion in 2019 to approximately €4 billion in 2028 at a 32% CAGR, materially ahead of the
B2B and B2C market.

_Digital, AI and Data Services_

Digital transformation is beginning to impact the diagnostic testing market and create new market
opportunities relating to services, including digital offerings, such as virtual consultations with medical
professionals with AI-driven triage, diagnosis and referral. In addition, machine learning is being used to
analyze biological data sets and support clinical decision making, and AI-driven holistic data integration of
medical data sets can be used in drug development.

The digital, AI and data services market is projected to grow from approximately €1 billion in 2023 to
€2.5 billion in 2028 at approximately a 20% CAGR.

_Point-of-Care Testing_

While point-of-care testing is expected to grow, with physicians performing selected laboratory tests in
their practices, especially those where rapid results are required, a vast majority of tests do not need to be


-----

done on an urgent basis require time from physicians and/or need significant specialization. The test cost
structure at a physician's practice cannot compete with central laboratories.

Point-of-care testing market is projected to grow from €7 billion in 2023 to €12 billion in 2028 at
approximately an 11% CAGR. We expect large market participants, including us, to develop cost-effective
point-of-care testing solutions via partnerships in high-growth market sub-segments and geographies (e.g.,
the United Kingdom, France and Germany).

_Quality Standards_

Changes in quality standards are also shaping the clinical laboratory services market. We expect that the
quality standards applicable to the sector, although varying from one country to another, are likely to
become increasingly restrictive in the coming years. Compliance with applicable national-level regulations,
accreditation or certification standards and the requirements of standard-setting bodies are not only
necessary for the continued operation of laboratories but also, in certain markets, a prerequisite for selection
as a contractual partner with health insurance providers or hospitals and clinics. Maintaining high quality
standards and meeting increasingly stringent accreditation requirements is costly and time consuming and
may force smaller laboratories and laboratory networks to merge or consolidate in the future. For example,
French legislation now requires that all clinical laboratories should have undertaken a quality accreditation
process and it is likely that other European countries will follow suit. In view of the resources required to
implement these quality standards, many small- and medium-sized independent laboratories could be
tempted to join a network offering a quality control department and dedicated teams. See "Regulation—
_France."_

We are the leader in medical diagnostic services and specialty testing in Europe. We offer a full range of
innovative and reliable medical diagnostics to patients, practicing doctors, hospitals and clinics,
governments and corporates. Providing the leading level of service within the industry, we are the partner
of choice for routine and specialty diagnostics in human medicine. We continuously innovate medical
diagnostic services for the benefit of patients and customers. We are present in 33 countries across five
continents and hold leading positions in most markets, regularly reinforcing the strength of our network
through a proven acquisition and portfolio optimization strategy, while remaining focused on diligent cost
control through initiatives such as our "SALIX" (Scale, Alignment, Leverage, Instruction, X-check)
operational excellence program. More than 27,000 employees, including over 2,000 medical experts,
contribute every day to our worldwide success as we perform around 600 million laboratory tests per year.

Our business is well-positioned to take advantage of the growing market for clinical laboratory and medical
diagnostic services in Europe, which benefits from favorable structural trends, including an aging
population, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, a growing focus on disease prevention, increasing
outsourcing of clinical laboratory testing by hospitals and an additional need for advanced testing.

We have been a pioneer in the consolidation trend in the European clinical laboratories market. Our
expansion strategy is focused on adapting to local market environments while drawing from the strength of
our pan-European support functions. Our market position and the scale of our laboratory network also allow
us to benefit from favorable procurement conditions with suppliers, including through group-wide panEuropean framework supply agreements for reagents and equipment. Major parts of the European clinical
laboratory and medical diagnostic services market remain fragmented, providing further meaningful
opportunities for continued expansion.

Our SALIX program consists of efficiency-enhancing and cost-savings initiatives relating to laboratory
centralization; group-wide logistics management; and the optimization of staffing of laboratories and blood
collection points. The SALIX program addresses all three of our primary cost groups (i.e., materials,
personnel and other operating expenses). Having been implemented in 2017, with the first savings achieved
in 2018, SALIX has generated approximately €140 million in total savings, including approximately
€25 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 and approximately €30 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, with further ongoing savings expected over the medium term.

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded revenue of €2,691.1 million, with net profit
(group share) amounting to €130.0 million. Our _Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA was_
€455.6 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, amounting to 17.6% of our revenue for
the period. For a reconciliation of net profit to Adjusted Operating Profit and Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted
EBITDA, see "Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data."

We have a pan-European presence and hold a top three or top five market position by revenue within most
of the markets where we operate. We provide clinical laboratory and medical diagnostic services through a
network of more than 450 laboratories and more than 1,800 blood collection points across 33 countries,
with core markets in France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. We also provide clinical laboratory

testing services in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. Our global footprint and our leading market
positions in certain geographies are illustrated in the map below.

We report our business activities across four operating segments (France, Germany, South and
North & East). The table below provides information about our revenue from external customers for the
twelve months ended September 30, 2023, and our number of laboratories (excluding blood collection
points) as of September 30, 2023, by operating segment.

_______________
(1) Our South segment includes the following geographies: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Italy, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Portugal
and Spain. Our business in Switzerland was included in our South segment until we ceased operating in Switzerland in 2023.

(2) Our North & East segment includes the following geographies: Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark,
Estonia, Finland, Ghana, Hungary, Lithuania, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Türkiye, the
United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. Our businesses in Poland and Ukraine were included in our North & East segment
until we ceased operating in those geographies in 2023.

Our business operations are characterized by a high degree of diversification across customers and payers,
geographies, testing services and test parameters. We benefit from a broad and diverse customer and payer
base that includes tens of thousands of medical practices, hundreds of hospitals and millions of individuals,
in addition to medical insurance companies, governmental bodies, pharmaceutical companies and other
corporate employers.

Revenue is generated across three channels: (i) B2B (which has historically provided approximately 60%
of our annual revenue), through hospital laboratory outsourcing, services to physicians and through lab-tolab services; (ii) B2C through retail/blood collection points; and (iii) D2C through prevention services and
wellness tests (with the B2C and D2C channels together providing the remaining approximately 40% of
our historic annual revenue).

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_We operate in the large, resilient and growing clinical laboratory services market, which has advantages_**
**_for established market participants and is supported by strong non-cyclical growth trends that have been_**
**_accelerated by COVID-19-pandemic tailwinds._**

Our core markets have grown materially throughout the last decade and have proven resilient to economic
cycles. The market is also expected to continue to benefit from favorable demographic factors, such as an
aging population, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases as well as an increasing propensity of public
healthcare providers to outsource diagnostic services to private sector companies, a shortage of experts and


-----

personnel specifically in molecular biology, genetics and pathology, a growing focus on disease prevention,
increasing outsourcing of clinical laboratory testing by hospitals, a growing market for D2C services,
precision medicine and digital, AI and data services, the monetization of healthcare data and an increasing
demand for fast servicing in specialized diagnostics. These are expected to be key growth drivers for the
future.

Medical diagnostics services are an essential part of the medical value chain, with approximately 70% of
medical decisions based on laboratory results. The medical diagnostic testing market we address today is
large, resilient and is expected to grow from a market value of approximately €28 billion in 2023 to
approximately €34 billion by 2028, growing at an approximately 3–4% CAGR.

The medical diagnostics market in our core European countries (France, Germany, Italy and the United
Kingdom) is expected to grow at approximately a 2% CAGR from 2023 to 2028. Our established leadership
position and reputation as a high quality provider in the medical diagnostics market affords us certain
advantages that put us in prime position to grow with the market, which include: (i) economies of scale:
significant benefits derived from experience in longer test series infrastructure (lower fixed cost per test)
due to scale benefits in overhead and logistics; (ii) increasing regulation: established players are better
equipped to deal with strict quality certification regimes, accreditation and guarantor requirements that
create financial hurdles that are burdensome for smaller, or independent operators; (iii) know-how: large
players are best positioned to acquire and retain skilled medical staff and specialists; (iv) reputation: the
build-up of reputation as a reliable, high-quality service provider is time-consuming for new entrants (e.g.,
building up a referral network) resulting in a competitive advantage for established players; and (v) the
_contractual nature of the B2B market: with excellence built into our services and strong relationships with_
physicians in the B2B market and NHS contracts, such as our Synnovis partnership agreement with Guy's
and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in South East
London, we are well entrenched as incumbents with a strong knowledge of the hospital or provider
situation.

In addition to resilient market fundamentals, COVID-19 provided a strong tailwind to the diagnostic testing
market during the pandemic and a testament to the counter-cyclical nature of the industry. While COVID19-related testing levels have now subsided and normalized, the industry is now benefitting from an
increased focus on awareness and disease prevention. This is driving innovation on the provider side and
is increasing access to diagnostic services across the globe, which is expected to continue to sustain volume
growth in the long term. In addition, the temporary revenue increases resulting from SARS-CoV-2 testing
and COVID-19-related services have allowed us to invest in our underlying business and ensure that our
core services are well-funded going forward.

Finally, the medical diagnostic services markets we serve are highly competitive and remain largely
fragmented, providing significant opportunities for larger players like us to continue to consolidate the
industry, entering new markets and reinforcing presence in existing markets. We believe that consolidation
of the clinical laboratory testing market will allow large international laboratory consolidators like us,
which benefit from high testing volumes across geographic markets, to further expand regional laboratory
clusters, improve efficiency and decrease overall costs.

**_We are a global player in the medical diagnostics space and the market leader in Europe by revenue with_**
**_comprehensive capabilities across a broad range of routine and specialty testing services and are well-_**
**_diversified across geographies, channels and payers._**

We are the largest clinical laboratory services company by revenue in Europe. Our revenue of
€3,250.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 25% greater than that of the
second largest player in Europe and, like us, that player is estimated to have generated around one-quarter
of its 2022 revenue from COVID-19-related services. We are present in all three of the largest EU markets
by nominal GDP (i.e., France, Germany and Italy) and in the United Kingdom. We are one of the leaders
in each of these four countries, which we consider our core markets, as well as in other geographies. In
addition, we have established a strong presence in high-growth emerging markets across Eastern Europe,
Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. In total, we are present in 33 countries across five continents.
We have achieved leading positions in more than 20 countries, representing a significant proportion of the
countries in which we operate.

We draw numerous tangible scale benefits from our wide geographic footprint, leadership position in local
markets and full range of services. These include: the ability to offer more competitive contractual terms to


-----

customers; enhanced procurement power; the ability to consolidate and automate procedures; the
knowledge and resources to create new capabilities (e.g., in retail or hospital settings); the critical mass to
build an integrated IT infrastructure; and the expertise to capitalize on opportunities for large-scale data
analytics. Scale is a critical differentiator driving costs down and creating a competitive advantage
compared to local and regional players.

We bring deep understanding of different market needs across the B2B, B2C and D2C business models,
adapting our services to local requirements to enhance patient experiences. This commercial and
operational flexibility is a key enabler of our new business generation, customer and payer diversification
and new market entry. We are well-diversified across the channels, with B2B contributing approximately
60% of our revenue and the remaining approximately 40% coming from B2C and D2C channels.

Our strong reputation, market position and proven expertise and presence across all testing categories,
enable us to attract and retain industry-leading medical experts and qualified specialists. As a result, we
have cultivated a wide network of medical experts, significantly enhancing our medical capabilities and
ability to innovate. Through close collaboration with research departments from universities and the
pharmaceutical industry, we continuously enhance our diagnostic offering. Furthermore, we have
accumulated vast expertise through our operational scale and global presence, which we leverage across
markets.

Our business also benefits from a wide payer base, including statutory and private insurance, hospital
systems, individual clinics and out-of-pocket spending. Our pan-European presence and expertise across
payer groups allows us to draw on our experience and know-how while entering new markets, adapt quickly
to local conditions and create value.

All of the above factors contribute to our well-balanced portfolio across business models, enabling us to
serve across different markets. This also ensures diversification across geographies, channels, nature of
contracts and types of tests, offering inherent stability and not materially exposing us to any single customer
or market segment.

**_Our customer-centric strategy is aimed at delivering above-market growth and is based on medical and_**
**_operational excellence and highly skilled employees._**

Our strategy of customer-centric medical excellence has yielded tangible results, including unlocking
additional organic revenue growth by providing a superior patient and clinician experience. We are capable
of delivering a highly customized end-to-end customer journey that includes registration, sampling,
diagnostics, reporting and consultation.

We operate an efficient hub-and-spoke network of laboratories (including approximately 30 "hub"
European reference laboratories and central laboratories and 420 "spoke" medical laboratories). Our "hub"
laboratories consist of two European reference laboratories (near Stuttgart, Germany and near Barcelona,
Spain) and additional central laboratories in all of our major countries, all of which perform specialty testing
services on samples provided from other network laboratories. In addition, our "spoke" laboratories, which
include regional laboratories, satellite laboratories and emergency laboratories, together with our point-ofcare testing capabilities, make up the backbone of our efficient hub-and-spoke model. Our "centers of
excellence" located across our laboratory network deliver medical expertise for certain medical areas and
have specialist diagnostic competencies. Through our laboratory network, we are able to offer a wide range
of analytical and diagnostic testing services, conducting over 600 million tests per year, including more
than 5,000 routine testing services in the field of clinical testing; genetic and anatomic pathology testing of
both histological and cytological samples; and diagnostic imaging. In the year ended December 31, 2022,
our routine testing services provided approximately two-thirds of our revenue, while our specialty testing
services and our other services (e.g., anatomic pathology, examinations, genetics and imaging) each
represented approximately one-sixth of our revenue.

We offer a tailored approach to prescribers and focus on retail management capabilities. Our business has
a broad retail base with millions of patients and a large prescriber customer base. We develop innovative
products and provide value-added solutions to hospitals, dialysis centers, polyclinics, outpatient clinics,
laboratories and others via a variety of business models including point-of-care, management and supply,
outsourcing, joint ventures and consulting services. We adapt our business models (B2B, B2C or D2C) to
suit customer requirements, for example, by providing only certain specialty tests, entire laboratory


-----

outsourcing services or special consultancy services as necessary to meet the specific needs of our
customers. This adaptability is one of our core strengths and is a testament to our customer-centric strategy.

Medical excellence is at the core of our business. We offer a full spectrum of approximately 5,000 different
testing services ranging from routine to highly specialized (including genetics, anatomic pathology,
radiology and nuclear medicine) and we have established ourselves as the top European player in anatomic
pathology and genetics. Our genetic testing capabilities include full exome sequencing, large gene panels
and single genetic variants. We also have capabilities covering all anatomic pathology sub-specialties.

We benefit from the shared medical knowledge of over 2,000 doctors and specialists and partnerships with
leading medical universities, which have fostered innovation and contributed to 368 medical publications
by SYNLAB scientists in 2022.

In addition, we have built a large and highly integrated platform of laboratories on a global scale with a
network of over 450 laboratories across 33 countries. This scale at global level creates unique advantages
by allowing us to centralize administrative functions and reduce costs. We also leverage our experience
across different countries to use the most optimal strategy for entry into new markets, addressing that
market's unique structure and allowing us to drive above-market growth and efficient integration. Our
extensive B2B operations, serving hospitals and physicians (e.g., in Germany, Italy and the United
Kingdom), account for around 60% of our revenue. We deploy a variety of strategies including systematic
campaigning by country to prescribers, developing demand management tools for clinicians and hospitals
and delivering high-end medical capabilities, reinforcing our medical leadership reputation. Our global
laboratory network and understanding of market segmentation positions us for rapid and professional
expansion in attractive new markets and enhanced ability to estimate and realize synergies when
acquisitions are made in new geographies. We also provide D2C operations focused on prevention and
wellness that are paid out-of-pocket in Italy, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, France and Hungary.

The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated our unique medical, operational and commercial capabilities. We
partnered with national healthcare systems and governments from the outset of the pandemic to develop
tests and procedures, leveraging our innovation expertise and securing supply chains early to rapidly roll
out testing internationally. This strengthened our position as a trusted medical partner and adviser globally
and allowed us to win contracts with businesses, educational institutions and sports associations to safely
get employees back to work, students back to school and athletes back on the playing field.

Our customer-centric strategy has resulted in above-market growth in our key markets. For example, over
the period from 2019 through 2023, our B2B business in Germany and the United Kingdom and our B2C
business in France and Italy all grew at CAGRs exceeding the market CAGRs for the same period. Our
German and UK B2B businesses generated revenue CAGRs of approximately 5% and 6%, respectively,
while the underlying markets grew at approximately 2% and 5%, respectively (in each case, excluding
SARS-CoV-2 testing revenue). Similarly, our French and Italian B2C businesses generated revenue
CAGRs of approximately 2% and 6%, respectively, ahead of underlying market growths of approximately
1% and 3%, respectively (in each case, excluding SARS-CoV-2 testing revenue), over the period.

**_We have a strong financial profile, with profitability accelerating through robust organic growth,_**
**_operational efficiencies, a disciplined approach to capital allocation and solid cash generation._**

We have consistently demonstrated solid growth, increasing our total revenue by a CAGR of 11.3%
between 2012 and 2022 (or 8.3% when excluding COVID-19-related revenue). We have largely exceeded
long-term revenue growth guidance of 3%, recently having posted 5.1% growth between January 1, 2022
and September 30, 2023 (consisting of 1.6% of pricing growth and 3.5% of volume growth).

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrated outstanding revenue growth, largely driven by our
ability to capitalize on the SARS-CoV-2 testing opportunity and adapt to the changing macroeconomic
environment. Between 2020 and 2022, our total COVID-19-related revenue was approximately
€3.0 billion, with €618.0 million of COVID-19-related revenue in 2020, €1,579.0 million in 2021 and
€€789.0 million in 2022. Over the same period our Adjusted EBITDA Margin averaged 27.1% and our
Cash Conversion averaged 84.5%.

While our COVID-19-related revenue declined in 2022 from its peak in 2021, our base revenue from our
core business (excluding COVID-19-related revenue) posted 6.2% year-on-year revenue growth in the year
ended December 31, 2022, as a result of positive volume developments in routine (excluding SARS-CoV

-----

2) and specialty testing as well as positive price impacts driven by price indexation to inflation in certain
regions while experiencing reimbursement reduction in others. Overall, revenue for our core business
(excluding COVID-19-related revenue) grew at a 7.8% CAGR from €1,807.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018 to approximately €2,584.1 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023.

In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we delivered organic revenue growth of 6.9% year-on-year
(excluding COVID-19-related revenue), of which 5.4% was a result of increased volumes and the remaining
1.5% was a result of price growth. We expect our long-term revenue development to continue to be
supported by favorable structural growth trends and benefit from our various retail initiatives, such as
opening new blood collection points, strengthening our testing portfolios and D2C initiatives.

During the period from 2020 through 2022, our Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased significantly from
historic levels to 25.9% in 2020, 32.1% in 2021 and 23.2% in 2022, primarily as a result of the shift in
business mix towards significantly higher margin SARS-CoV-2 testing. As illustrated below, our quarterly
Adjusted EBITDA Margin declined through 2022 and has stabilized in 2023, albeit at a level that is below
that seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating a clear path for further improvement.

From 2022 through 2023 to date, COVID-19-related earnings have subsided significantly and our Adjusted
EBITDA Margin declined to 16.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was also partially
an outcome of the higher inflationary environment. We believe both SARS-CoV-2 testing, which has been
impacting our business mix, and the current high inflation levels, which are impacting our personnel and
operating expenses, are temporary factors that are affecting our business in the short term but are expected
to normalize over the medium term.

We expect 2023 to continue to be a year of normalization, with margins stabilizing as we refocus the
business on core fundamentals. Going forward, we expect margin recovery to occur as a result of (i) nearterm factors, such as the elimination of costs incurred as a publicly listed company that are not expected to
be incurred under private ownership and savings from the elimination of COVID-19-related personnel costs
and (ii) mid-term broader cost optimization as we continue to focus on cost base improvements through the
SALIX program.

In addition, we expect further margin uplifts to result from operating as a private company following the
Acquisition and from a ramp-up in the profitability of our Synnovis partnership in South East London with
Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, which
is a 15-year contract that began in 2021. Although this contract was initially margin dilutive, it is expected
to become accretive in the near term as we roll out a new centralized platform to replace the existing hospital
laboratory systems.

We have a solid track-record of driving operational improvements and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
expansion through several cost savings initiatives, particularly SALIX, our leading operational excellence
program introduced in 2017. SALIX is executed locally, but systematically tracked centrally on an ongoing
basis. SALIX is broadly categorized between material expenses, personnel expenses and operating
expenses, focused on procurement efficiencies, headcount efficiencies, digitalization, automation and our
laboratory footprint. Historically, we have delivered €20–25 million in cost savings each year across the
SALIX program since inception and approximately €140 million since inception. In 2022, SALIX
generated approximately €25 million in total savings helping to partially offset the change in business mix
and inflationary pressure, with further ongoing savings expected over the medium term, including


-----

€45 million estimated for the year ending December 31, 2023, €30 million of which was delivered in the
nine months ended September 30, 2023.

In addition to these cost savings, we have also generated savings on personnel costs through the reduction
and ultimate elimination of headcount specifically allocated to COVID-19-related functions. As full-time
capabilities related to COVID-19 are no longer driving significant revenue production as they did in 2021
and 2022, we have recalibrated our focus on allocating personnel in accordance with our underlying core
business. Since mid-2023, we have not had any personnel specifically employed for COVID-19-related
functions, which is down from 3,500 employees at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We have maintained our 2023 outlook and are on track to deliver on our €2.7 billion revenue guidance
(including greater than 4% organic growth), with 74% (€1,989.9 million) of 2023 revenue guidance having
been achieved in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (or €1,924.0 million after taking into account
acquisitions and disposals that occurred during the period). We also expect to reach our 16–18% Adjusted
EBITDA Margin guidance for 2023 and continue on our path to margin expansion in the long term on the
back of (i) stable volume growth, supported by geographical densification, improving operational and
logistical efficiency with a positive impact on profitability as well as positive impact from changing
business activity mix, with a view towards higher margin testing products in key geographies and
(ii) productivity gains, including the continued impact of our initiatives such as digitalization, laboratory
footprint optimization, the STS discussed below, headcount efficiencies and automation. Reduced cost
inflation, net of prices increases, could further result in a tailwind and tangible lever to our future organic
margin expansion. Our strong track record of accretive acquisitions and synergies extraction, coupled with
active portfolio management at all levels, is also expected to positively contribute to our long-term
profitability development.

Finally, our business benefits from relatively low levels of working capital and net capital expenditure,
which comprises acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets net of disposals of
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Due to our favorable business model, we are able to
generate strong cash flow despite the temporary macro-economic headwinds described above, generating
the capacity to de-lever while continuing to support our prudent acquisition strategy. Our Cash Conversion
(excluding non-recurring capital expenditures of €11 million in 2021, €34 million in 2022 and €50 million
the first nine months of 2023 related to the contract ramp-up of our Synnovis partnership agreement with
Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in South
East London) was 89% in the year ended December 31, 2021, 84% in the year ended December 31, 2022
and 72% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023.

**_We are a key market consolidator with an active portfolio management and disciplined acquisition_**
**_strategy and a demonstrated track record of disciplined acquisitions, successful integration and_**
**_efficiency realizations across geographies, with further consolidation opportunities in the fragmented_**
**_European and Latin American markets._**

We have a long history as a leading consolidator in the European clinical laboratory services market with
a proven ability to source and execute value accretive M&A, while also actively optimizing our portfolio
by divesting margin-dilutive and non-core businesses.

Consolidation of the market is driven by the introduction of new regulation, increased pressure on margins,
mandatory accreditations that increase costs for smaller players or individual laboratories, aging biologists
close to retirement looking for an exit and the ability to compete against scaled players. With large parts of
the market remaining unconsolidated, we have significant runway to further consolidate the market in our
key regions. Since the formation of the SYNLAB Group in the second half of 2015 through the first threequarters of 2023, we completed 159 acquisitions (excluding additional acquisitions in business units that
were sold during that period). While there is significant growth and consolidation potential remaining in
the market and we believe we are well-positioned to continue to take advantage of opportunities as they
present themselves, our M&A strategy is, and will, continue to be disciplined; it is fully aligned to our core
strengths and additive to our organic growth levers.

We have well-established processes and structures in place that allow us to evaluate and steer our targets
from identification to due diligence and acquisition and on to the post-merger integration. These processes
with clear criteria for M&A are at the core of our disciplined approach to acquisitions. The plans for postmerger integration that are drawn up ahead of an acquisition and diligent execution thereof give us the
confidence that the expected value creation and deleveraging through synergies are aligned and achievable.


-----

We benefit from a dedicated team focused on finding, evaluating and executing external growth
opportunities. We have developed a structured approach to acquisitions that capitalizes on the expertise and
market knowledge of both our management and local laboratory doctors. Our management team has a
strong track record of executing buy-and-build strategies through targeted acquisitions and the integration
of laboratories into group operations. We have consistently expanded our laboratory networks through
acquisitions.

We have a clear track-record of implementing operational efficiencies to realize synergies, cost savings and
drive improvements to gross and operating margins. Our size allows us to efficiently integrate and optimize
laboratory operations, procurement functions and production processes through the identification of best
practices and improving our information technology platforms. This includes our ability to extract
advantageous procurement conditions with our suppliers, in particular through our Group-wide panEuropean framework supply agreements for reagents, calibrators, quality controls and automates. After
acquiring clinical laboratories, we also implement efficiency measures aimed at increasing profitability
leveraging the application of relevant best practices from across our network.

We are also focused on optimization through a dynamic portfolio management strategy where we have
divested certain businesses, with a focus on either (i) lower-margin businesses and geographies or
(ii) selling assets where accretive multiples are achievable and using the proceeds to de-lever or reinvest in
efficient operations. As part of this strategy, in July 2023, we completed the sale of our Swiss business,
which had been dilutive to margins in recent years, allowing us to reduce our net debt by approximately
€154 million, and, in September 2023, we completed the sale of our veterinary business in Belgium,
Germany and Spain, disposing of a non-core business that accounted for less than 1% of our total revenue
in the year ended December 31, 2022, resulting in net proceeds of approximately €194 million.

**_We benefit from a highly experienced international management team at group and local levels, who are_**
**_well aligned on strategy, with deep market knowledge and experience in navigating local regulatory_**
**_requirements and delivering growth. This team is well supported by shareholder representatives with_**
**_deep knowledge of the medical diagnostic sector._**

Our more than 27,000 employees, including over 2,000 medical doctors and other specialists in our
laboratories, are led by our chief executive officer, Mathieu Floreani and our chief financial officer, Sami
Badarani. Mr. Floreani first joined the Group as Deputy CEO of SYNLAB Limited in 2017 and became
CEO in 2018, having previously held CEO and executive positions in several leading global businesses,
including the Forwarding division of DHL Americas and McKinsey, over his more than 30-year career.
Mr. Badarani also joined the Group in 2017 and has over 30 years of experience, having previously served
as CFO of Bureau Veritas, Director of Group Finance of Alliance Boots and CFO of GE Energy Contractual
Services.

Our executive-level management team is supported by our experienced international management team in
the implementation of our strategies. In addition, we benefit from the experience of the CEOs of our four
operating segments and our strong country management teams that have deep market knowledge and
experience in navigating local regulatory requirements and acquiring and integrating new laboratories. Our
management team has a demonstrated track record of delivering growth, executing and integrating
acquisitions and driving operational efficiencies. This has led to a continuing transformation of our
business, including its impact on environmental, social and governance practices.

We believe the industry knowledge and leadership of our senior and country management teams, combined
with their long-term experience, provide us with the skills necessary for continuously improving our
performance and efficiency through a common corporate infrastructure and the implementation of best
practices across our network, constituting a significant competitive advantage.

In addition, we have a strong shareholder base through Cinven, as well as key minority investors, including
the Qatar Investment Authority and Dr. Bartl Wimmer, the founder of SYNLAB. Cinven, which will
become our majority shareholder following the Acquisition, has intimate knowledge of the company and a
deep understanding of the sector and the underlying trends, having been our majority shareholder from
2015 until our initial public offering and having remained our largest shareholder following our initial
public offering. Cinven has signed an investment agreement backing our long-term strategy and we
anticipate continued positive cooperation with them.

strong brand recognition and reputation on the basis of which we intend to deliver world-class service to
our patients and our customers. We will continue to leverage our reputation to reinforce the public
perception of the quality and breadth of our services, to attract new customers as well as skilled medical
staff, particularly doctors and other primary care physicians.

We have committed to a strategy of medical expertise and scientific leadership based on the highest
standards of quality, ethics and reliability. We aim to continuously invest in our facilities, technologies and
scientists. We plan to maintain and reinforce our "centers of excellence" culture across our laboratory
network, not only within larger European reference laboratories and central laboratories but also in smaller
ones. We also intend to further develop our medical expertise by ensuring that all our laboratories continue
to be fully accredited in accordance with the highest local standards and by maintaining industry leadership
in self-regulation, governance and participation in pan-European scientific committees. The voice of our
experts is increasingly heard in all of the healthcare systems we work with and we aim to increase this
active participation in the medical discussions of the topics of our time, as evidenced during the COVID19 pandemic. We also remain alert to changing trends in testing patterns and continue to introduce new
tests that position us at the forefront of the medical diagnostics field.

Leveraging this medical expertise, we will continue providing customers with accurate test results with the
highest possible medical precision, the shortest possible turnaround time and the lowest possible analysis
error rate. Customer experience is also enhanced via additional services (e.g., counselling services pre- and
post-test). In addition to this, we will also continue to roll out "SYNLAB Access," an intuitive digitalized
tool with a focus on enhancing the patient journey.

As some healthcare systems are coming under significant budgetary pressures, public and private hospitals,
organizations and other healthcare providers are seeking to improve the productivity and the medical quality
of their services by outsourcing inefficient and sub-scale laboratory activities to diagnostics experts. We
are well-placed to take advantage of this trend as we can provide a full spectrum of outsourcing solutions,
ranging from referral testing services to full outsourcing with the transfer of entire teams and assets, most
notably in France, Finland, Germany, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. For example, we have been
entrusted with the largest hospital outsourcing contract ever granted in the United Kingdom; the Synnovis
partnership in South East London with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College
Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. This project aims to deliver a capital efficient service modernization
program with leading service digitalization, implementing digital pathology, allowing access to our global
clinical network, driving reduction of laboratory estates and cost of testing. This experience and track record
positions us well as more hospital systems consider outsourcing.

Under the growth initiatives program "For You," we systematically implement campaigns in each country
and enhance sales force effectiveness with prescribers, develop connectivity with clinicians and tools for
demand management. We also continuously reinforce our medical leadership, reputation and establish
clinical partnerships. At the same time, we continually increase the number of specialty tests in order to
provide a broader service offering across our network, for example by continuing to identify and
introducing testing services in various geographies and therefore creating a consistent and increasing panEuropean products and services offering driving further growth.

We also invest significantly in selected areas, such as patient and doctor interfaces to increase client-base
proximity and in AI technologies to enhance customer service and satisfaction propositions. Moreover, we
have launched our D2C proposition focusing on prevention and wellness. Leveraging our extensive
experience in running a web shop in Estonia that we have operated since 2017, pilot D2C projects were
launched in the United Kingdom and Italy in 2022 and subsequently expanded to Portugal, Spain, France
and Hungary. We expect this market to evolve and capture a growing share of the medical diagnostics
market.


-----

We are also focused on leveraging our scientific and operational know-how to deliver our sophisticated
propositions in higher growth emerging markets, mainly with respect to Latin America (including
Colombia, Mexico, Chile and Peru) and Africa (Nigeria and Ghana).

**_We will sustain our focus on innovation and operational excellence by leveraging our scale, capabilities_**
**_and supplier relationships to drive operating efficiencies and profitability._**

We utilize technological innovations like state-of-the-art software, AI and digitalization to further improve
our diagnostic service processes and simplify our business. For example, our implementation of eXtensible
Business Reporting Language (XBRL) simplifies our reporting formats and addresses audit regulations.
Similarly, digitalization in diagnostic services enables us to support the work of our colleagues and
employees. This also helps us work efficiently with physicians and improves how they deliver treatment
and medical care. We have also established a team that will leverage AI to refine our customer solutions
offering, based on our proprietary data, which will further help us pioneer new opportunities. Our strategy
is to focus on providing decision support through rule-based annotation support, develop demand control
tools and enable virtual consultation by means of digital communication. This not only positions us to
deliver stronger customer experience but also reduces costs by leveraging technology and improving
operations.

We intend to continue leveraging our extensive network to streamline our laboratory operations and
administrative functions and to strengthen our post-merger integration processes and capabilities while
enhancing our service offering. In doing so, we aim to continue reducing our operating costs through
operational efficiency improvements across our laboratory network and the optimization of procurement
contracts at lower costs. This is captured under our SALIX program, which is focused on regaining preCOVID-19 pandemic productivity and is driven by implementing identified global initiatives including
procurement contracts, targeted COVID-19 employee and other personnel reductions, supply chain
management, process standardization and digitalization.

SALIX is underpinned by three key pillars. The first pillar is procurement (captured under material
expenditure). We seek to leverage our scale to save on direct and indirect costs, thereby reducing materials
costs and operating expenses. The second pillar is the STS which is based on Lean Six Sigma principles
(automation, workspace design, planning and scheduling, multi-skilled workforce, standardization,
performance management). STS is a management system supporting our strategy and is considered the
engine driving us to operational excellence by enabling customer centricity, productivity increases and a
healthy organization. STS also has the effect of reducing operating (captured under operational expenditure)
and personnel expenses (captured under personnel expenditure). All cost savings from STS are transferred
into SALIX. The third pillar is focused on our laboratory network, including refining our "hub" and "spoke"
network, ensuring it has superior logistics and reliable technical service and maintenance functions. This
pillar also has the effect of reducing operating and personnel expenses. In 2022, SALIX generated cost
savings of €25 million, with savings of material expenses accounting for 42%, personnel expenses for 22%
and operational expenses for 35%.

In addition, we are focused on network optimization, especially in areas with limited density of blood
collection points, which impacts margins. We actively manage our blood collection point network either
by opening or refurbishing existing blood collection points or acquiring blood collection points locally to
expand our reach and extend our scale. Within blood collection points, we are rolling out the STS across
the platform, resulting in lower waiting times, improved NPS scores and increasing revenue from out-ofpocket services.

**_We will develop our talent by empowering and engaging our employees._**

To deliver a best-in-class service for our patients and customers, we rely on committed and qualified people.
Employees are the interface to patients and customers and are critical to our success.

Employee engagement, with the objective of driving enhanced organizational performance, is a key pillar
of our strategy. This effort is reflected in three Group-wide initiatives: (i) the SYNLAB Leadership Model
(ACCE), (ii) the SYNLAB Campus and (iii) SYNLAB Dialogue. The SYNLAB Leadership Model
(ACCE) is a proprietary model of leadership training that aims to align individual management actions to
the principles and values shared within the company. The SYNLAB Campus is one of the core platforms
for people development, focused on creating a new way of working based on a culture of collaboration and
reflecting our values of passion, accountability and customer centricity. SYNLAB Campus provides


-----

professional development courses and training to enhance personal and professional effectiveness, as well
as further Group-level initiatives. SYNLAB Dialogue is a Group-wide annual survey that gives employees
an opportunity to anonymously share their views with the organization and is intended to serve as a base
for improving our human capital and driving continuous improvements to continue to be recognized as a
great place to work.

In addition, our human resources strategy is also focused on establishing successful talent and succession
management programs, establishing an environmental, social and governance ("ESG") company culture
that demonstrates commitment to corporate social responsibility and sustainability and enables clear
performance management processes throughout the organization.

Other programs implemented include acknowledgement of employee contributions (e.g., by offering
medical awards and research grants), dual education opportunities and the creation of a work environment
that minimizes the risk of accidents.

We have a strong focus on ESG with a dedicated board committee monitoring the progress of our ESG
strategy. It is based on three pillars, SYNLAB Green, SYNLAB Care and SYNLAB Citizenship. Our new
central laboratories including our Synnovis partnership agreement with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS
Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in South East London, our new
central laboratory in Munich, Germany and ongoing construction of a new medical center in Florence, Italy
adhere to the highest ESG standards.

**_We will pursue growth and profitability opportunities through efficient capital allocation, investments_**
**_in our business and selective acquisitions / divestments in current and new markets._**

We operate a highly cash generative model, with a major focus on accounts receivable and managing capital
expenditure efficiently. Ensuring capital is efficiently allocated to facilitate growth opportunities is critical.

From 2018 through 2022, we invested around €110 million per year on average in targeted infrastructure
developments to support our operational excellence strategy. Infrastructure investments typically include
new blood collection points and commercial activities, logistics infrastructure, diagnostic centers,
improvements in existing laboratory and blood collection point facilities, laboratory equipment, customer
interaction and end-user service platforms, as well as back office and IT. In 2021, beyond the normal
investments in our core activities and in further response to the COVID-19 pandemic, significant
investments were made to set up appropriate SARS-CoV-2 testing capabilities across the network. These
investments position us well for the medium term, with fewer one-off capital expenditures expected and
better control over leases expansion going forward.

We also benefit from a prudent and disciplined external growth strategy, focused on a balanced and lower,
as compared to previous years, annual spend in the medium term (approximately €75 million investment
on M&A as of September 30, 2023, in line with our planned reduction in 2023 from levels of M&A
spending in prior years) and increased focus on accretive bolt-on acquisitions as opposed to transformative
and large-scale deals, with tangible scope to generate operational efficiencies and synergies. Our ability to
integrate these acquisitions and extract cost savings are a key contributor to our profitability. We are
typically able to realize synergies within 12–24 months from acquisition, primarily by optimizing costs
through group level advantages in procurement and other functions and through streamlining personnel
expenses, leveraging group supplier contracts and existing group and regional support functions. We also
have a disciplined approach to entry price, focusing on post-synergies valuations of approximately 9-12x
EBITDA.

Given our strong cash flow performance, we can generally self-finance planned acquisitions, mostly made
up of highly accretive bolt-on acquisitions. Generally, we see ourselves in a strong financial position to
continue consolidating the market and creating value from our own resources. In 2023, we have temporarily
reduced our M&A spending from historic levels to fully focus the business on achieving the same
productivity level as before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Separately, we have an active portfolio management strategy. We continuously monitor performance at the
level of countries, segments, entity, contract or customer groups, with a reinforced focus on countries or
segments with low margins (less than 10% Adjusted EBITDA Margin), divesting lower performing assets
or assets that can be sold at highly accretive multiples. We evaluate market structure, degree of
consolidation, critical scale required in the market, organic growth of laboratory testing services in the


-----

country and reimbursement and regulation trends. While the most immediate focus is on assets with
Adjusted EBITDA Margins below 10%, we also aim to decrease the revenue contribution of businesses
with margins below 20% (which contributed approximately 52% of our revenue in the first half of 2023)
and look for opportunities to simplify our business model. The completed sale of our veterinary diagnostics
business in Belgium, Germany and Spain in September 2023 and of our business operations in Switzerland
in July 2023, are outcomes of such evaluation. These businesses were sold for attractive multiples and were
margin accretive for the whole Group, with cash inflow from the sale of subsidiaries, net of cash disposed
and changes in debt having amounted to €346 million. The proceeds have been reinvested and utilized for
the purposes of deleveraging (including repaying in full €220 million of term loan B debt under a facility
that was outstanding at the time in July 2023).

**Our History**

The SYNLAB Group, as it is currently constituted, was formed when Labco and SYNLAB were acquired
by Cinven (as majority shareholder) and its co-investors in 2015. These businesses were subsequently
integrated as a single group under the SYNLAB name. SYNLAB was founded in 1998 by Dr. Bartl
Wimmer by combining four laboratories in Germany. Since its inception, SYNLAB has continued to
develop its expertise in routine and specialty laboratory testing, consistently expanding its presence and
services through acquisitions in Germany and abroad. Labco was founded in France in 2004, operating a
strong network of routine and specialist laboratories and over 1,000 collection centers across seven
European countries.

We completed our initial public offering and subsequent admission to listing on the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange on April 27, 2021 in order to gain access to capital markets and reduce our leverage. As a result
of a capital increase in kind, by contributing the shares of SYNLAB Limited into SYNLAB AG, SYNLAB
AG became the parent company of the Group. We have been listed on the Prime Standard of the Frankfurt
Stock Exchange since April 30, 2021.

Built as the combination of two large businesses, we have a successful track record of sector consolidation.
From the formation of the SYNLAB Group in October 2015 through September 30, 2023, we completed
159 acquisitions of laboratories. In 2020, we disposed of our Analytics & Services ("A&S") business to
fully focus on expanding our core human medicine activities. In July 2023, we completed the sale of all of
our Swiss entities to Sonic Healthcare as part of a strategic decision. In 2022, we finalized the sale of our
UK veterinary diagnostic business and in September 2023, we completed the sale of the remainder of our
veterinary diagnostics businesses in Belgium, Germany and Spain to Mars Incorporated.

In March 2023, Cinven announced its preliminary intention to launch an acquisition offer for SYNLAB
AG and on September 29, 2023, Cinven announced the decision to launch the Acquisition Offer (See "The
_Transactions—The Acquisition—The Acquisition Offer")._

**Services**

We are active in the field of medical diagnostics and clinical laboratory services. The nature of our services
varies from one country to the next and according to the type of establishment.

Testing is generally organized in three phases: (i) the pre-analytical phase, which consists of collecting
samples and delivering them to the clinical laboratory; (ii) the analytical phase, during which the test itself
is carried out; and (iii) the post-analytical phase, during which test results are sent to the prescribing doctor
and the patient while our laboratory doctors validate the results and assist with interpreting the results.

(i) **_Pre-analytical phase. Before clinical testing is performed, samples are collected from the patient,_**
identified and delivered to our analytical laboratories. Patient samples are labeled immediately
with an identification number that is logged into an information technology system by the health
practitioner who performed the extraction. Tests are subjected to quality control as well as
technical and biological validation procedures.

Samples are usually accompanied by a test request form (in electronic or paper format). The form
states which testing services are to be performed and provides the necessary billing information.

Collecting and analyzing samples taken from patients is often carried out at different locations,
and samples therefore are moved from their collection point (such as hospital sites, doctors'
practices or our blood collection points) to our laboratories. In most of our markets, including in


-----

all of our core market countries of France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, some of our
laboratories maintain their own fleets of vehicles and provide both transportation and logistics
services in order to ship samples to our laboratories. In other countries, we outsource this service
to major transportation companies such as DHL and UPS. The transportation of samples is subject
to certain legal requirements, in particular those relating to sample integrity and data
confidentiality. Maintaining our own logistics network allows us to tailor logistics solutions for
the collection of the samples to the needs and requirements of our customers.

(ii) **_Analytical phase. Once the test request form has been entered into our information technology_**
systems and the samples have been collected, the tests are performed, either automatically (in the
case of most routine testing services) or by our laboratory doctors or technicians (in the case of
most specialty testing services).

(iii) **_Post-analytical phase. As soon as they are available and then technically and medically validated,_**
test results are inputted either manually or through an electronic data interchange system that is
connected with the practitioner, clinic or hospital, depending upon the kind of testing services
carried out, the type of equipment used and the country in which the testing services are performed.
We run telephonic service centers to support our clients and our medical experts will consult with
practitioners, clinics and hospitals once the results are provided to them.

**_Human Medicine Diagnostics_**

Human medicine diagnostics are the primary focus of our business operations and are offered across our
entire network of laboratories in each of the countries in which we operate.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, revenue from human medicine diagnostics amounted to
€1,936.8 million, or 97.3% of our total revenue.

Our human medicine diagnostics can broadly be divided into routine and specialty testing services and also
include examination and imaging. We estimate that routine testing represents approximately two-thirds of
our testing activity, with specialty testing and examination and imaging collectively representing
approximately one-third of testing activity. In addition, in 2020 we began providing SARS-CoV-2 tests.
We performed 35.3 million SARS-CoV-2 tests for the year ended 2021, consisting of 29.7 million PCR
and 5.6 million non-PCR tests. In 2022, the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests performed declined to
17.9 million PCR and 2.6 million non-PCR tests as the COVID-19 pandemic was coming under control.

_Routine Tests_

Routine clinical laboratory tests are regularly used in general patient care by doctors to establish or support
a diagnosis, to monitor treatment or to search for an otherwise undiagnosed condition. The most frequently
requested types of test are biochemistry, hematology, coagulation, immunology and bacteriology. We
perform these categories of routine tests in all of our laboratories. We perform most routine procedures,
and generally report their results within 24 hours, by using a variety of sophisticated and computerized
laboratory testing instruments. Our routine testing services include, among others: coagulation tests, blood
cell counts; blood chemistry analyses; urinalyses and alcohol and other substance abuse tests.

_Specialty Tests_

Specialty clinical laboratory tests involve a higher level of complexity than routine tests, are conducted by
skilled laboratory professionals and generally utilize more sophisticated technology, equipment or
materials. In contrast to routine test results, which are frequently provided on a same-day basis, the
processing time for specialty testing services is typically one day but can range from several days to up to
one week for more complex or less frequent testing services. Our specialty testing services involve tests in
the following fields, among others: human genetics; molecular oncology; cytology and pathology;
hematology and coagulation testing; immunology and immunogenetics; microbiology and infectious
diseases; specialized endocrinology; nutritional biology; virology; allergology; serology; toxicology; and
drug analysis. We perform specialty testing services in all countries in which we operate.

We offer (i) a catalogue of more than 5,000 testing services; (ii) the ability for clients to integrate results
directly from our "Laboratory Information Management System" into their electronic medical records;
(iii) medical and technical multilingual support; and (iv) expertise in the field of sample transportation.
Through this know-how, we can satisfy the outsourcing needs of most laboratories around the world,


-----

including our clients located in geographies outside of our largest established markets, such as Latin
America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa.

To remain competitive in the clinical testing market, we intend to further enhance our testing capacity.
Teams led by our Chief Medical Officer monitor the scientific literature and trade press, hold talks with
test manufacturers and suppliers in order to identify new testing services that become commercially
available and, when appropriate, add them to our range of services. Introducing new testing services
requires giving information about the testing services to those who can prescribe them (such as doctors and
hospitals) and, in many instances, third-party payers that cover the reimbursement of such testing services.
We often use our customer service and continuing medical education initiatives to educate prescribers about
new testing services. We describe the range of routine and specialty testing services offered by each of our
laboratories in our pathology handbook/test catalogue that enables us to keep our main prescribers regularly
informed about changes that may occur in the services that we provide.

_Anatomic Pathology_

Anatomic pathology is, along with clinical laboratory testing and imaging, one of the principal diagnostics
disciplines that we provide. This discipline is dedicated to the morphological study of macroscopic and
microscopic anomalies of biological tissues and pathological cells removed from a living or dead human
being. Anatomic pathology is widely used in oncology to detect and assess the efficiency of the ablation of
tumors. We use the most advanced pathology techniques, using equipment that enables us to perform a
wide range of tests, from studies that comprise traditional cytogenetic techniques.

Preparing samples is an important and highly technical stage during which a thin slice, only a few microns
thick, is placed onto a glass slide before being colored in order to be examined using a microscope. The
preparation, examination and diagnosis of a sample cannot be fully automated, which results in substantial
labor costs.

Anatomic pathology also encompasses cytopathology. Cytopathology studies cells smeared over a glass
microscope slide and not cross-sections of cells. The cells are, accordingly, whole cells and can be more
easily observed. Some of the most widespread cytologic analyses include lumbar or articular punctures,
bone marrow punctures and pap smears.

The development of "telepathology technology" has paved the way for major progress in the discipline.
Sample slides can now be digitalized and shared easily, allowing a doctor's diagnosis to be established more
easily and swiftly and enables the sample to be sent to specialized doctors anywhere in the world in the
case of a complex pathology.

_Medical Imaging and Nuclear Medicine_

Nearly all of our medical imaging and nuclear medicine services are provided by our Italian and Finnish
subsidiaries where we have the necessary expertise and cutting-edge technology.

(i) Medical Imaging

Medical imaging encompasses several disciplines such as radiology, scanography,
mammography, orthopantomography (dental imaging), sonography and Doppler sonography.
Scanning and mammography are our most widely used disciplines.

Technical, technological and IT developments allow more sharply defined and more precise
images to be obtained, more rapidly than in the past. We anticipate that this trend is likely to
continue to gather momentum. Moreover, systems already enable images to be digitalized and
communicated to allow a diagnosis to be made remotely.

(ii) Nuclear Medicine

Molecular imaging is a medical imaging discipline that provides an in-depth view of what occurs
within the human body, at the level of molecules and cells. While conventional medical imaging
(i.e., X-rays, scanography and ultrasounds) generates an image of the patient's physical structure,
molecular imaging enables a doctor to observe the metabolic or molecular activity of the body or
its organs by using a technique that is not significantly invasive. Molecular imaging offers a unique


-----

vision of the body that allows doctors to, among other things, detect cancer early and precisely,
determine appropriate therapies and monitor the patient's reaction to a specific drug or treatment.

_SARS-CoV-2 Tests_

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, four basic types of laboratory tests have been developed and used
to test for SARS-CoV-2:

(i) Nucleic-acid amplification tests (including RT-PCR, TMA and LAMP) ("NAAT") evaluate the
presence or absence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, generally in samples from the respiratory tract
(e.g., nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, mouth wash, saliva). PCR and equivalent nucleicacid tests are currently considered the most accurate way of determining if a person is carrying
SARS-CoV-2. A positive result indicates that the viral genome is present but does not definitively
establish if the person is contagious or not.

(ii) Serological tests, both rapid and automated immunoassays, detect the presence of antibodies
(specific humoral immune response) against SARS-CoV-2 antigenic proteins in a blood sample.
Rapid test results are available within 10–15 minutes and a positive result shows that the person
has been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the past but gives little or no information on their current
infection status. Automated new generation tests provide specific information for each of the
involved antibodies, allowing us to quantify IgG antibodies if present to provide information on
immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is very relevant for the follow up of vaccination
effectiveness.

(iii) Cell mediated immunity tests document the cell mediated immunity response to SARS-CoV-2
infections and vaccinations. While cell mediated immunity tests are not widely used, they are very
important in some specific clinical situations.

(iv) Antigen tests measure the presence or absence of the viral proteins (antigens) themselves, most
commonly the abundant nucleocapsid protein. The preferred sample type is again nasopharyngeal
or oropharyngeal swabs, although saliva is already an alternative sample type. Antigen tests are
less sensitive than NAAT and their application is limited to symptomatic patients, during a short
time after onset of symptoms.

We provide testing to support safety at work, at sports events and universities, and when travelling or
crossing borders. The aim is to identify potentially contagious individuals as early as possible, which means
also detecting the virus in pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers — for which the RT-PCR or an
equivalent NAAT is essential.

**Operations**

**_Laboratories_**

Our operations are conducted through our laboratories and blood collection points. We classify our
laboratories into "hubs" and "spokes." Typically, hubs focus on certain medical areas to perform specialty
tests as a center of excellence and spokes focus on highly automated routine and selected specialty tests
with quick turnaround time.

European reference laboratories and central laboratories are classified as hubs while regional laboratories,
satellite laboratories and emergency laboratories are classified as spokes.

The type and size of a laboratory varies from one country to another because of differences between
healthcare systems and regulatory environments. The number of laboratories that we operate changes
regularly as we acquire new laboratories, merge laboratories, win or lose emergency laboratories in
hospitals and transform laboratories into blood collection points.

_Hub Medical Laboratories_

European Reference Laboratories

Our pan-European operations are supported by our two European reference laboratories, near Stuttgart,
Germany and near Barcelona, Spain. These laboratories, together with our "centers of excellence," which


-----

feature specialist diagnostic expertise and competencies within one specific field of diagnostics,
collectively offer processing of the full spectrum of more than 5,000 test parameters and medical advice on
a multilingual basis from multidisciplinary teams. The specialty testing services are conducted by highly
skilled laboratory professionals led by medical doctors, biologists and chemists and often require our most
sophisticated technologies, equipment and materials.

The European reference laboratories act as global hub laboratories that can carry out highly sophisticated
specialty testing services when subcontracting for other laboratories and are the entry points for samples
from countries across the world into our laboratory network. Samples are transported by air and results are
electronically provided to customers, including hospitals, prescribing doctors and patients. This business is
particularly developed in Europe and in Latin America (in particular, Brazil and Mexico), where our local
subsidiaries or partners connect us with new customers. In other countries in Latin America (e.g., Uruguay),
Eastern Europe, Africa or the Middle East where we do not have our own subsidiaries, we use commercial
agents in order to set up partnerships.

Central Laboratories

Our central laboratories, located in nearly all of the countries in which we operate, are centralized, highly
specialized laboratories with specific, specialty testing capabilities, including test parameters outside the
full routine spectrum of testing services, such as, among others, serology, autoimmunity and molecular
testing. Such specialty testing services are conducted by highly skilled laboratory professionals. Specialty
testing services from across our laboratory network are primarily conducted in our state-of-the-art central
laboratories in order to maximize utilization rates and efficiency. Our central laboratories often also house
many of our "centers of excellence."

_Spoke Medical Laboratories_

Regional Laboratories

Our regional laboratories are highly automated and equipped with advanced equipment to perform high
volume routine testing services. Our regional laboratories centralize the processing of all or some test
samples from blood collection points, satellite laboratories and emergency laboratories, and typically offer
a test spectrum of several hundred different testing services. Due to the highly automated processes of our
advanced, multipurpose testing equipment, the processing time at its regional laboratories is frequently only
a few hours, with same-day delivery of results.

Satellite Laboratories

Our satellite laboratories perform routine testing services prescribed by doctors and medical institutions in
connection with general patient care to establish or support a diagnosis, to monitor treatment or to search
for an otherwise undiagnosed condition. Many of our satellite laboratories are located in or near the
hospitals that they primarily serve. Results of routine testing at our satellite laboratories are predominantly
delivered to patients and prescribing healthcare professionals on a same-day basis.

Emergency Laboratories

Our emergency laboratories are located in, or adjacent to, the hospitals that they primarily serve and are
focused on quickly providing results on the shortest possible turnaround times, in many cases 24 hours a
day and up to seven days a week. Emergency laboratories perform basic and emergency tests prescribed by
doctors and medical institutions in connection with general patient care to establish or support a diagnosis,
to monitor treatment or to search for an otherwise undiagnosed condition.

**_Point-of-Care Testing_**

We provide point-of-care testing analysis instruments that provide doctors and nurses with immediate
reporting of results. Point-of-care testing is usually conducted by light and mobile analytical instruments
that can be installed close to the site where they are needed (e.g., emergency rooms, intensive care units,
delivery rooms, operating rooms and doctors' offices).

**_Blood Collection Points_**


-----

Blood collection points are common in certain of the markets in which we operate, such as Belgium,
Colombia, Czechia, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain, where test samples are taken at dedicated collection
points rather than by a physician. Globally, we directly operate approximately 1,800 blood collection points
and also have employees in other facilities around the world. Tests and analyses of blood samples are
typically not performed at our blood collection points. Rather, these blood collection points generate sample
volumes and transfer samples to the appropriate network laboratories for analysis. We own or holds
partnerships for blood collection points in nearly all of the countries in which we operate laboratories.

**_Logistics_**

We operate our own logistics service with our own drivers and fleet in most of the markets in which we
operate. Our internal logistics team includes over a thousand employees who are responsible for ensuring
the timely delivery of test samples to our network of laboratories and maintain frequent direct contact with
our customers through the collection of test samples. We believe logistics is an integrated part of the service
value chain and helps to maintain our quality and reliability of service. Furthermore, the operation of our
logistics operations allows us to integrate new acquisitions of laboratories into our existing operations and
laboratory network, in particular with respect to specialty laboratory testing where applicable national
regulations permit the cross-border transport of laboratory samples. The vehicles that make up our logistics
fleet are primarily leased. We also partner with selected external national and international logistics
providers, particularly in geographic markets where we do not operate our own logistics activities.

**_Subcontracting and Outsourcing Laboratory Services_**

We offer public and private hospitals, clinics and other medical institutions the possibility of subcontracting
and outsourcing their clinical laboratory services in most of the countries in which we operate. The range
of services we offer differs according to customers' needs. Some customers want to outsource all of their
clinical laboratory services, while others prefer to keep some of these services in-house such as, for instance,
sampling, the logistics involved in collecting samples, the diagnosis of certain types of pathologies, medical
validation or emergency services. The markets in which we offer to subcontract and outsource clinical
laboratory services are characterized by high barriers to entry since the process followed in a call for tenders
requires a company to invest considerable time before being selected as a potential subcontractor. Being
selected requires technical expertise and substantial investment capacities. Finally, the reputation and
experience of the bidders are key criteria if they are to be picked as a subcontractor.

We consider a number of strategic reasons for this type of cooperation, in all cases depending on different
markets, business models and customer requirements. For example, we might enter into joint ventures with
hospitals as an opportunity to expand our medical and scientific know-how, consider fully integrating a
partner into our hub-and-spoke operating model or simply take advantage of favorable cost efficiency that
outsourcing and subcontracting may present.

**Operating Segments and Core Markets**

We operate across four geographic segments: France, Germany, the South segment and the North & East
segment. Our core market of Italy is the largest contributor to revenue in the South segment, which also
includes our Latin American operations, including the fast-growing market of Colombia. Our core market
of the United Kingdom is the largest contributor to revenue in the North & East segment.

**_France_**

We first entered the diagnostic services market in France in 2004. As of September 30, 2023, we operated
67 laboratories and approximately 387 blood collection points in France.

Approximately 75% of our business in France is B2C (direct business only). Each of our laboratories and
blood collection points in France employs a medical doctor or a specially trained pharmacist (both
commonly referred to as "biologists"). Our laboratories are distributed throughout France and are mainly
located in small towns or rural areas, but we are also present in major cities such as Bordeaux, Marseille,
Montpellier, Nantes, Nice, Lille and Paris. Our limited operations in large cities is due to our belief that
clinical laboratories can be bought at more attractive prices in small towns than in big cities, while the
revenue and average profitability per laboratory in large cities is generally lower than the national average
in France.


-----

We are the fourth largest provider of clinical laboratory testing in France based on revenue, with the top
three making up approximately 53% of the market. Our primary competitors in France include Cerba,
Biogroup, Inovie, Unilabs and Eurofins Scientific. The portion of the French market addressable by us as
a private laboratory company is expected to grow at approximately a 1% CAGR from 2023 to 2028.

_United Kingdom_

Our laboratories in the United Kingdom are focused on human medicine laboratory testing through the
outsourcing of hospital services from NHS hospitals and with laboratories offering services directly to
private clients. Pathology partnerships and joint ventures make up the core strategy for us in the United
Kingdom.

We are one of two leading private providers of clinical laboratory testing in the United Kingdom based on
revenue. We have created the second largest private provider in the United Kingdom in less than ten years.
Our primary competitor in this segment in the United Kingdom is Health Services Laboratories, a
partnership between two NHS trusts and The Doctors Laboratory, which is owned by Sonic Healthcare.
We and Health Services Laboratories together make up approximately 85% of this segment in the United
Kingdom.

In November 2020, we entered into a partnership agreement with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation
Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust to become the London Trusts' new pathology
partner and transform and deliver pathology services across South East London for 15 years, with services
commencing in the second quarter of 2021. Bolt-on activity from Chelmsford Hospital within our existing
joint venture with the Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust is expected to result in additional
revenue for us. We also have an initiative to expand into adjacent service offerings, such as end-to-end
workplace drug and alcohol testing solutions, which are offered by our subsidiary, Lextox. Our laboratories
in the United Kingdom offer our full spectrum of routine and specialty testing services.

Our revenue in the United Kingdom amounted to €251.9 million, or 12.7% of our total revenue for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023.

_Other North & East Segment Countries_

The four largest revenue contributing countries among the other 20 countries in the segment for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023 were Czechia, Belgium, Hungary and Finland, which collectively
represented 32.8% of revenue for the segment and 9.5% of our total revenue for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023.

We hold the number two market position in Czechia, with the top three players having a combined market
share of approximately 40%. We hold the number one market position in Hungary with a market share of
approximately 80%.

We hold the number one market position in Nigeria, where the top three players collectively hold 60% of
the market share. We hold the number two market position in Ghana, where the top two players collectively
hold 80% of the market share.

As a result of the hostilities between Russia and Ukraine, our services in Ukraine were interrupted for a
brief period in 2022. We sold our Ukraine business entity on August 1, 2023 and have not operated in
Ukraine since that date. The hostilities between Russia and Ukraine had a very limited impact on our
revenue, as the Group generated no revenue from Russia and only generated limited revenue from Ukraine
(less than €1 million in 2022) and Belarus (less than €4.5 million in 2022).

**Acquisitions and External Growth Strategy**

Significant parts of the European clinical laboratory services market remain fragmented. As the leading
consolidator in the European clinical laboratory services market (based on the number of acquisitions
completed), we are well positioned to drive market consolidation.


-----

Since our founding, we have developed our business both through strategic acquisitions of local and
regional laboratories, as well as through selective acquisitions of larger clinical laboratory groups to access
new markets and expand our presence in existing markets.

Our M&A strategy is based on four axes: (i) focusing on our core market countries aimed at densification
of the operating with multiple add-on acquisitions in order to streamline operations; (ii) in the other existing
countries, focusing on bolt-on acquisitions to densify and expand territories; (iii) the acquisition of "new
platforms" by entering into new countries or regions with the aim to pursue future bolt-on acquisitions; and
(iv) other acquisitions aimed at increasing certain skill sets, technologies and other value accretive
acquisitions. We typically analyze acquisition targets in terms of enterprise value-to-EBITDA multiples
and aim to deleverage following their restructuring and integration. Based on an analysis we conducted in
2018, we estimate that average acquisition multiples for bolt-on M&A acquisitions carried out in 2016 and
2017 were between 6–7x enterprise value-to-EBITDA including estimated post-acquisition synergy-led
EBITDA improvements during the first full calendar year for 2017 acquisitions and the second full calendar
year for 2016 acquisitions. The enterprise value acquired in the year ended December 31, 2022 was
approximately €130 million (2021: €225 million). M&A activity in 2020 was reduced due to the COVID19 pandemic before returning in 2021 and 2022 as we reviewed a strong pipeline of opportunities across
existing and new markets. In 2023, to build on our current M&A strategy and to align with the current
market environment, we have shifted our focus from large acquisitions and increased our focus on portfolio
optimization, including divesting low-margin businesses and geographies.

From the formation of the SYNLAB Group in the second half of 2015 through September 30, 2023, we
completed 159 acquisitions of laboratories (excluding additional acquisitions in business units that were
sold during that period). Built as the combination of two large businesses, we have a successful track record
of sector consolidation.

We have developed a structured and disciplined approach to acquisitions to complete transactions
efficiently and effectively. This approach enables us to achieve favorable financial and legal terms and
conditions, while still executing quickly enough to acquire the most attractive opportunities. Potential
acquisition targets are initially screened for their strategic fit by our country chief executive officers.
Potential acquisitions targets are then further screened at a group level. This review takes place once a target
is identified and validated and before a non-binding offer is submitted. Our M&A department reviews
potential target laboratories in close coordination with our local management (in the case of acquisitions in
existing markets) and our group sourcing and operations teams. The same department is also tasked with
finding targets in new countries or with sourcing larger deals. Final approvals of acquisitions are subject to
consideration and satisfaction of a rigorous set of criteria, including, among others, (i) geographic and
strategic fit; (ii) mandatory financial, tax, legal, labor, compliance and operational due diligence;
(iii) additional commercial due diligence for new markets or new business lines; (iv) valuation multiples;
(v) synergy potential; and (vi) review by our post-merger integration teams.

Integration of acquisitions is led primarily by our country management teams, with oversight and support
provided by management at a group level. Post-merger integration targets the realization of identified
synergies, including laboratory network optimization, process improvement, back-office centralization,
insourcing of specialty tests (to our European reference laboratories as well as national hub laboratories)
and procurement optimization. As part of our procurement optimization strategy, we implement our panEuropean framework agreements with preferred suppliers upon closing of the acquisition and implement
standardized laboratory processes and best practices in a phased manner.

For acquisitions of local and regional laboratories, as well as larger businesses, once the acquisition has
been completed, we typically aim to achieve about half the expected synergies in the first twelve months,
and the majority of the remaining synergies during the second year. Where we purchase laboratory
businesses directly from laboratory doctors, we generally prefer for those laboratory doctors to continue
operating them. In the case of sizeable acquisitions, we aim to retain the key managers in our local
management teams, to ensure retention of specialist and local market knowledge.

Our M&A strategy has a history of success across markets and practices.

**Quality Standards**

We are subject to regulation relating to the quality of the testing services we perform and the manner in
which we conduct tests. In every country in which we operate, we are subject to the national legislation that


-----

defines the mandatory quality standards we must comply with in our operations. These regulatory
requirements vary from one country to the next.

Our quality assurance efforts are primarily focused on single test quality, with daily calibrations and quality
controls in line with local regulatory requirements, results generally validated by at least two people and
final sign-off of test results being done by the appropriate qualified individual, such as the medical doctor
or biologist. Quality assurance includes correct patient identification of samples, reporting accuracy,
proficiency testing, reference range relevance, process audits, statistical process control and personnel
training at all of our laboratories and blood collection points. We also focus on ensuring that our
professional and technical staff receive the proper training and satisfy applicable licensing and credentials
requirements.

We believe that we comply with applicable accreditation or certification standards in the countries in which
we operate, and, where they apply, we believe that we comply with the requirements set by standard setting
bodies, such as the International Organization for Standardization ("ISO"), among others.

We seek to assure the highest level of diagnostic quality control throughout the Group. Our laboratories
follow calibration and quality control assessment processes and are subject to periodic external reviews for
quality assurance. In addition, in various countries, we are a member of self-regulation associations of
laboratories or physicians and are committed to the highest quality standards for laboratory services.

We are committed to a strategy of medical expertise and scientific leadership based on the highest standards
of quality and reliability. We will continue to focus on providing customers with accurate test results with
the highest possible medical precision and the shortest turnaround time. We intend to further develop our
medical expertise by ensuring that all of our laboratories continue to be fully accredited in accordance with
national regulations, and, where applicable, in accordance with European standards, such as those laid down
by the ISO, as well as internal quality assurance standards (ISO 15189).

For more information on the key regulations applicable to our business, see "Regulation."

**Environmental, Health and Safety**

Our operations are subject to licensing, authorization and regulation under EU, national and local laws and
regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and occupational health and
safety, including those governing the handling, transportation and disposal of medical samples and
biological, infectious and hazardous waste, and the clean-up of contaminated sites. All of our laboratories
are subject to strict requirements for the disposal of laboratory samples at authorized facilities, and we
generally use external service providers for the disposal of such samples.

In addition, we must meet extensive local requirements relating to workplace safety for employees in
clinical laboratories who could be exposed to various biological risks such as blood-borne pathogens
(including HIV, the hepatitis B virus and, more recently, SARS-CoV-2). These local requirements might
include work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-ups,
vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and the transmission of, blood-borne
pathogens. The required measures and related costs vary with time and regulation.

We strive to employ comprehensive and strict environmental, health and safety systems in our facilities and
believes that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements.
See also "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Failure to comply with and establish appropriate
_quality standards as part of our testing services may adversely impact our reputation and results of_
_operations."_

For more information on the key regulations applicable to our business, see "Regulation."

**Customers**

We provide testing services to a diverse range of customers and payers that encompasses public and private
healthcare providers, including hospitals, public and private clinics and laboratories, physicians, public
health agencies, the general public, statutory and private health insurance companies, pharmaceutical
companies, clinical research organizations, companies and governments. We consider any party that either
directly contacts us or refers a patient to one of our laboratories to be a "customer." We consider any party
from whom a sample is taken or on whom a test is performed to be a "patient." Lastly, we consider any


-----

party that pays for the testing services performed to be a "payer." In most cases and depending on the
country, our customers, patients and payers may each be different persons or entities.

Our customer base varies considerably from country to country. The main categories of customers to whom
we provide our services are:

   - **_Patients. Patients with a prescription for testing from their doctor may choose the clinical_**
laboratory in which their testing services will be performed. The main factor taken into
consideration when choosing a laboratory is usually how close it is to the patient's home or
workplace.

   - **_Independent healthcare professionals and partnerships of health professionals. In each of_**
our core market countries, physicians determine which laboratory tests should be performed
and, in certain countries, healthcare professionals who require testing for their patients can
recommend our laboratories. Healthcare professionals take samples themselves and send them
to hospitals or private laboratories such as ours and determine themselves where the sample is
sent. Consequently, the relationship with healthcare professionals is of significant commercial
importance and as a result, we create personal relationships to generate trust and confidence
in our services.

   - **_Hospitals. We provide hospitals with services ranging from routine and specialty testing to_**
contract management services with attractive prices. We operate certain clinical laboratories
that hospitals generally maintain on-site to perform immediate testing. However, hospitals
may also refer less time-sensitive, less frequently needed and/or more highly specialized
procedures to outside facilities, including independent clinical laboratories such as ours.

   - **_Laboratories. We perform specialty testing services for other clinical testing laboratories via_**
our hub medical laboratories.

   - **_Private medical insurance companies. In certain countries, private medical insurance_**
companies typically require their insured patients to choose from a list of pre-selected
laboratories with which these insurers have a reimbursement contract. The list varies
depending on the patient's private insurance scheme.

   - **_Companies. In some jurisdictions, employees are entitled to a regular medical check-up and_**
other prevention and wellness services paid for by their employers. The services related to
these check-ups are generally provided by specialized companies that subsequently
subcontract the tests to a private laboratory.

   - **_Governments. In certain countries, national health systems enter into large contracts for_**
hospital and ambulatory care.

   - **_Consumers. An area of increasing focus for us is that of individual consumers who pay out-_**
of-pocket without third-party reimbursement for wellness and prevention tests without
medical prescriptions.

   - **_Other institutions. We also provide services to other institutions, including government_**
agencies and other independent clinical laboratories that lack the breadth of our testing
capabilities.

Regardless of the category of customer, we offer fast turnaround times, quality customer service and
efficient processes. Our accessible locations, digital services and additional services facilitate smoother
interactions throughout all categories.

**Invoicing and Payment Procedures**

Billing for laboratory services is a complex process that sometimes involves many payers. Depending on
the billing arrangement and the applicable law of the country in which we operate, the payer may be either
a third party responsible for providing health insurance coverage to patients (such as a national public health
insurance system, a private medical insurance company or an employer), a patient, a practitioner or any
other party (such as a hospital, another laboratory or an employer) that referred the patient, or several of
these parties. Other than in our German hospital outsourcing business, for a select few contracts in Latin


-----

America, and in Spain, where we have entered into agreements with some private insurance companies or
hospitals on the basis of individual policyholders' expenditure, we generally bill for clinical testing services
on a fee-for-service basis.

**Synergies and Cost Savings Initiatives**

Synergies and cost savings are key components of our response to counter potential future price pressure
from government and third-party payers, providing for continuing profitable growth of our business. We
continue to optimize our laboratory networks, particularly in our core market countries, and improve the
efficiency of our operations and the effectiveness of our customer service, while simultaneously reducing
costs (i) primarily by making improvements in operational efficiency and procurement due to the combined
business' greater scale and (ii) through consolidation of laboratories in certain countries. Our cost savings
initiatives may lead in certain cases to restructuring costs, impairment losses, redundancy costs and
litigation costs.

We regularly undertake initiatives aimed at reducing costs for all expenditure items, having achieved more
than €150 million of cost savings since 2017 as a result of two programs, Gemini and SALIX. We achieved
approximately €24 million of cost savings between 2016 and 2017 as a result of our Gemini cost savings
program that was put in place to deliver operational synergies from the combination of the historic
SYNLAB and Labco businesses. Since 2017, we have been executing our operational excellence program,
SALIX, achieving approximately €110 million of cost savings between 2018 and 2022 and approximately
€30 million of costs savings in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with savings extraction targeted
to continue and improve in the short and mid-term as we continue to complete acquisitions. The SALIX
program consists primarily of the following major efficiency-enhancing and cost-savings initiatives:
laboratory centralization; group-wide logistics management; optimization of staffing of laboratories and
blood collection points. The SALIX program addresses all three of our primary cost groups — materials,
personnel and other operating expenses. In 2020, SALIX generated cost savings of €22 million, with
savings of material expenses accounting for 26%, personnel expenses for 41% and operating expenses for
31%. In 2021, SALIX generated cost savings of €20 million, with savings of material expenses accounting
for 48%, personnel expenses for 13% and operating expenses for 40%. In 2022, SALIX generated cost
savings of €25 million, with savings of material expenses accounting for 42%, personnel expenses for 22%
and operating expenses for 35%. For the year ending December 31, 2023, we anticipate SALIX to generate
cost savings of €45 million, with savings of material expenses accounting for 20%, personnel expenses for
48% and operating expenses for 32%.

**Suppliers and Procurement**

We benefit from a clearly defined procurement framework that is centrally led, managed and supported and
is adapted to locally driven requirements. The primary equipment and materials required to conduct our
business activities are testing equipment (including analytical systems, robotics, and pre- and postanalytical devices), reagents and other consumables. We regularly review our testing equipment needs and
have entered into several pan-European procurement agreements with certain preferred laboratory suppliers
for the supply of reagents and testing equipment, related services and maintenance. Our diversified supplier
base includes leading diagnostics suppliers such as Abbott, Beckman Coulter, Becton Dickinson,
bioMérieux, DiaSorin, Roche Diagnostics, Siemens Healthineers, Thermo Fisher Scientific and many
others, the top 20 of which represented 26.7% of our total spent. Multiple suppliers can supply us with the
equipment required to perform our testing services and we have more than one supplier for each diagnostic
field. Accordingly, we do not believe that we are dependent on any single supplier and therefore losing one
of our current suppliers would probably not have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our supply agreements enable us to benefit from the latest technological and medical advances and strike
the right balance between total cost, innovation, flexibility and risk management, as quality is one of our
key priorities. Our medical team is involved from the very beginning of the tendering process by drafting
specifications for every category of operation with which suppliers must comply.

The terms of these agreements typically range from three to seven years depending on the kind of activity
and include pricing frameworks. We have also entered into "per reportable result" agreements for certain
testing equipment, reagents and services. Under these agreements, the costs for reagents and consumables,
as well as the required testing equipment and related services, are variable and depend on the number of
tests performed. For example, the costs of testing equipment machines, reagents and consumables are


-----

frequently based on the type and number of reported results over a given period with bonus agreements in
place in certain agreements where we are above certain agreed volume thresholds.

We have also implemented inventory management policies for our network of laboratories, which are aimed
at lowering the level of our inventories by asking suppliers to remain the owners of certain products held
in our inventories and by making supply deliveries flexible according to the needs of our laboratories.

**Information Technology Systems**

We use IT systems in virtually all aspects of our business, particularly in clinical testing, test reporting,
billing, customer service, logistics and the management of medical data. Our ability to maintain our
operations depends on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our IT systems, especially when
time is of the essence for a laboratory test result.

Historically, we have grown through acquisitions, and, as a consequence, newly acquired laboratories often
use software platforms that are not consistent with the systems we have implemented, or plan to implement,
on a group-wide basis or are those otherwise used in the relevant country. We use our internal reporting
system in order to monitor key performance indicators locally in each of our laboratories and adjust our
operations accordingly. We are continuously integrating laboratory, reporting, billing and other information
technology systems, particularly with respect to newly acquired laboratories, but also with respect to
existing laboratories. We expect that the implementation of integrated practices and systems across our
network will take time to complete, and until such completion, there is a risk that our operations could be
disrupted during the implementation of new systems. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
_Technology."_

We have implemented application-specific measures such as stable and redundantly designed IT systems,
backup processes, virus and access protection and encryption systems, as well as standardized IT
infrastructure and applications. We regularly test and update our IT systems. Risk management related to
IT systems and applications is conducted using standardized regulations as well as an internal control
system.

We are faced with growing demand for the electronic delivery of laboratory data and because we are
committed to improving our patients' experience, we continuously develop our platforms by adding new
capabilities and services. In order to do so, we automate the workflow in patient service centers as well as
data processing in laboratories, while working on integrating patient health records and developing online
access to information on services and test results for its customers. The SYNLAB Medical Digital Services
platform is specially designed to support the international IT solutions and infrastructure used by healthcare
parties.

We invest in our IT platform to achieve operational stability, IT security and to reduce complexity of IT
operations. Our IT infrastructure is modernized, consolidated and harmonized on a Group level. SAP S/4
HANA is being implemented as a Group standard to ensure compliant and optimal finance, procurement
and billing processes and the laboratory systems are updated and harmonized on a country-by-country basis
to provide a modern and efficient operational and medical environment. All changes support compliance
with international and national regulations.

We are currently investing in the use of our large amount of data and medical know-how to develop medical
artificial intelligence solutions to provide better and faster test results, improve quality in our customer
service and to develop new advanced products to support "personalized medicine" within both professional
healthcare and the growing prevention and wellness business.

**Sales Forces, Assistance in Performing Tests and Establishing Diagnostics**

We operate in highly competitive markets across Europe, in which referring parties can send tests to the
laboratory of their choice.

We compete on the basis of several criteria, including the quality of our clinical laboratory testing,
innovation in our services, the breadth of the test parameters and services we offer, access points (e.g.,
blood collection points) throughout the various countries in which we operate and prices for our services in
the hospital laboratory outsourcing market. For example, in many of our markets, the patient or consumer
decides which laboratory to use for diagnostic services, making attractive access points particularly
important. Consumers are more likely to use laboratories that are close to their homes, are well-managed


-----

and provide the necessary level of communication. For hospitals in all of our countries, and in jurisdictions
where outpatient doctors (e.g., Niedergelassene Ärzte in Germany) provide prescriptions, the professional
business relationship that we have with these healthcare providers is of paramount importance. Peer-topeer medical consultations, our professional sales force, reliable IT connectivity and the quality and speed
of our service drive business development.

Our laboratory doctors and biologists, together with our marketing and sales professionals in our markets,
play an important role in the acquisition of new customers and in ongoing daily operations. Even in
geographies where management has a more direct role in identifying key prospective customers (e.g.,
because reimbursement agreements must be negotiated with private insurance companies), it is our
laboratory doctors who are entrusted with the crucial task of developing a relationship with healthcare
professionals. Our laboratory doctors provide their special expertise to healthcare professionals in
consulting as to which diagnostics tests to prescribe and how to interpret the results. In addition, we have
developed applications aimed at healthcare professionals. See "—Information Technology Systems" above.

Our laboratory doctors also continue to conduct independent research supported by the Group and
participate in international networks and pan-European scientific committees for certain areas of specialty
testing. They are supported by our country management teams.

**Property, Plant and Equipment**

Our operational facilities consist predominantly of clinical laboratories, blood collection points and office
space.

We rent nearly all of our premises and a majority (by value) of our laboratory equipment. Our policy is to
lease rather than own our facilities, preferably through long-term leases, except where concentrated activity
justifies the acquisition of the buildings in which these activities are conducted, such as certain property in
Colombia, Spain and Germany. We believe that our laboratories are generally adequate for our present
needs and that suitable additional or replacement space would be available to the extent required.

In 2019, we applied IFRS 16 (Leases) for the first time. IFRS 16 (Leases) introduced new or amended
requirements with respect to lease accounting by removing the distinction between operating and finance
leases and, subject to limited exceptions, requiring the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability
at the lease commencement. As of December 31, 2022, we owned property, plant and equipment with a
carrying amount of €311.5 million and had right-of-use assets with a net carrying amount of €656.0 million.

The property, plant and equipment that we own consists mainly of technical equipment and installations,
particularly automated devices and tools used to perform clinical testing, office and IT facilities, fixtures
and fittings for the premises and vehicles. The property, plant and equipment that we own is further
described in note 19 (Property, plant and equipment) to the 2022 Financial Statements included elsewhere
in this Offering Memorandum.

**Employees**

In the financial year 2022, we had an average number of employees of 29,153 compared to 27,337 in 2021,
primarily composed of (i) laboratory doctors and scientists such as biologists and chemists and
(ii) laboratory technicians.

We have a young, diverse and highly skilled workforce that is increasing frequently, mainly due to our
external growth policy. As of December 31, 2022, 51% of our employees were aged 40 years of age or
below and 49% were more than 40 years old. The gender split of our leadership (including approximately
1,600 employees from team leaders to Group executives) as of December 31, 2022 was above 60% female
and 40% male.

The following table sets forth our average number of employees during the year for each of the periods
indicated along with a breakdown of their main category of activity. The table for the year 2020 excludes
employees from our A&S business unit that was sold in 2020.

France is the country with the largest number of our employees, with 18% of our workforce as of
December 31, 2022, followed by Germany, with 15%. The geographic breakdown for the rest of our
employees was 30% in our North & East segment and 37% in our South segment.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, our payroll and related expenses amounted to €1,166.7 million,
including wages and salaries of €759.2 million, social security contributions of €234.8 million and other
personnel related costs (including bonus payments and premiums) of €100.1 million. The expenses related
to the Executive Long-term Incentive Plan and employee participation program described below will be
included in our future payroll and related expenses, and associated costs have been incorporated in our midterm business plan.

_Employee Representation_

The countries in which we operate provide various protections and other rights to employees. These
employment rights may require us to expend greater time and cost in altering or amending employees' terms
of employment or making staff reductions. Elections for employee representative bodies have been held in
accordance with applicable legislation. The rights, obligations and operating methods of these bodies vary
from one country to another, depending on local legislation.

We are subject to certain mandatory bargaining agreements in certain countries, such as Germany, and
collective bargaining agreements with unions representing our employees in certain other countries,
including in Italy and Hungary. In Germany, certain of our employees are represented by works councils
(Betriebsrat) and other representative bodies for employees with various information, consultation and codetermination rights. For example, in some jurisdictions, they must be notified in advance of any employee
layoffs, must consent to the hiring and relocation of employees and are granted co-determination rights in
social matters, such as work schedules and rules of conduct, as well as the rights to advice in respect of
certain transactions such as providing guarantees, attracting loans or the granting of security. As German
law prohibits asking employees whether they are members of unions, we do not know how many of our
employees are unionized. In general, our employees in Germany fall within the scope of the German
Dismissal Protection Act (Kündigungsschutzgesetz), which limits our ability to terminate individual
employment relationships unilaterally. We also comply with the German Anti-Discrimination Act
(Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz) and comparable legislation in other countries in which we operate.
In France, social dialogue is structured at the company level. Each company has, if necessary, a works
council and trade union representatives or a single staff representative body, depending on the number of
employees and the complexity of the company's structure. The management of each company negotiates
agreements with the representative trade unions on subjects such as incentive plans, gender equality and
working time reduction and flexibility. Such company's management chairs the bodies and can negotiate
company-wide agreements with the company's trade union representatives. In the United Kingdom, indepth work has been carried out with social partners to define the rules and organization governing the
transfer of staff from the NHS to us under a public-private partnership.

We believe that our relationships with our employees are generally good. We have not suffered any material
work stoppages or strikes in recent years.

_Employee Retention_

Strategic actions are taken in order to maintain employee motivation and focus so they elect to remain
employed and fully productive for us. These include SYNLAB Dialogue, our Group-wide employee
engagement survey, which measures a team's level of engagement, and Performance Management, which
promotes an environment for feedback to be requested, given, and received at least twice a year.

We also ensure employees are rewarded for their efforts, including access to special bonuses to recognize
their great mobilization in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent highlights include an
increased bonus for night shifts and negotiated long collective-bargaining agreements with the unions in
Germany, as well as new incentive programs such as profit sharing in France.


-----

_Employee Participation Program_

An employee share purchase plan was launched at the end of 2021, enabling all our permanent employees
to become shareholders from 2022. The plan enables us to reward the employees' contribution to the success
of the Group and also provides them the opportunity to build up a stake in our future performance of. Under
the plan, the employees have the opportunity to buy shares in the Issuer and receive one free additional
share for every four shares purchased after a period of four years of service.

**Environment and Corporate Social Responsibility**

We have a policy and code of conduct, nurtured by our vision, mission and values, to promote corporate
social responsibility ("CSR") principles and ESG best practices among our internal stakeholders (i.e., our
employees). We do so for the benefit of, and in cooperation with, our external stakeholders, including
customers, financial stakeholders (i.e., shareholders and bondholders), local communities, suppliers and
service providers, public administrations and the media. Our CSR strategy supports the implementation of
the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, with particular focus on (i) good health and well-being,
(ii) gender equality, (iii) decent work and economic growth and (iv) responsible consumption and
production.

Our ESG program takes into account diagnostics for the planet, diagnostics for people and ethical
diagnostics. We recognize that we can only be successful in the long term if we respect the environmental
and social context in which we operate. Our corporate governance is also crucial to our customers' trust in
us, whether in terms of the quality of our clinical work or the protection of confidential personal information
Our key ESG objectives include: (i) reducing the environmental impact of every test we deliver and limiting
our contribution to climate change; (ii) creating positive outcomes in our communities and empowering our
diverse employees; and (iii) operating with the highest standards in governance and compliance and
assuming our role as a responsible corporate citizen.

We are aware that the environment can dramatically change our practices and relationships with our
stakeholders. Our policy therefore encompasses the management and control of our footprint to limit and
mitigate the impact of our activities on the environment and available natural resources. In the medium
term, we are focused on the "SYNLAB Green" objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and
reducing waste generation. Our global CO2 emissions per million euros of revenue were 9.6 million tons in
2022, a reduction from 11.3 million tons in 2021.

We believe that social responsibility is not possible if the needs of the people in the communities where we
operate and those that we impact are not taken into account as a priority. We therefore strive to foster
sustainable human development through our commitment to society at large and, more specifically, to the
local communities in which our team members live and work. We also focus on developing social capital
and improving the quality of life for the entire community. Our efforts are also aimed at future generations,
acknowledging the legacy that our actions can generate. We are focused on the "SYNLAB Care" objectives
of increasing health and safety in the workplace, increasing diversity and equality, improving access to topquality healthcare, developing growth opportunities for our employees, retaining and winning new, talented
employees, financing further research and innovation and providing charitable contributions to overcome
societal challenges.

We further believe that reliability and integrity are key concepts in modern corporate governance and
sustained business growth is only possible where a firm is able to trust in the reliability of its shareholders,
customers, suppliers, members and employees—locally and globally. The cornerstone to building and
improving our reputation with all of our stakeholders is consistently upholding high standards of social and
ethical conduct. We are focused on the "SYNLAB Citizenship" objectives of completing the
implementation of our governance policies based on the highest professional standards, fully complying
with applicable corporate guidelines and policies, industry-specific regulations as well as environmental,
health and safety regulations, complying with applicable tax law and transparent disclosure and
implementing responsible supply chain management practices.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted and deepened our commitments to supporting communities,
ensuring healthy lives, promoting well-being and delivering the highest quality diagnostic services to our
customers. In 2020, we formalized our governance arrangements, identified and prioritized sustainability
issues, established measurable and time-bound targets and produced our first formal ESG report. In 2021,
we published for the first time our collective approach to sustainability, our goals and activities in an ESG


-----

report. Through this report, we aim to express our long-term commitment to continuous improvement in
our management practices. Amongst these is our focus to become a carbon-neutral business by 2025 as
well as our plans to establish a corporate foundation as a way to give back to the local communities in the
countries we operate in. Furthermore, we aim to increase female representation in top and senior
management positions by 2021. We are also putting our supply chain under closer scrutiny with steps to
identify any human rights risks in the supply chain. In 2022 and beyond, we intend to further improve our
data measurement and disclosure for key ESG issues and develop new programs and policies that support
our ESG targets.

**Research and Development, Patents and Licenses**

We are committed to continuously developing our medical expertise by further improving our track record
of research and innovation to underline and expand our medical leadership.

Our strong reputation and market position enable us to attract and retain industry-leading medical experts
and qualified specialists. As a result, we have cultivated a wide network of medical experts, who collaborate
on dozens of projects led by university research departments and the pharmaceutical industry, and we
sometimes fund research grants to continuously enhance our diagnostic offerings.

We have continued to grow the number of registered publications with more than double the volume in
2020 compared to 2015. Our scientists published 368 scientific articles in 2022 alone.

We also honor cutting edge research and publications with the SYNLAB Medical Innovation Awards and
maintain a Research Grants program to foster innovation and medical excellence.

Our innovation pipeline is further sourced from the research and development of our equipment and test
suppliers. Our expertise in leveraging our operational scale and global presence allows us to bring new
technologies and innovative offerings to market quickly and make them accessible even in remote locations.

Alongside our diagnostic innovation management, a main focus is on digitalization and the advancement
of digital customer interfaces. We continuously invest in increasing our patients' and clinicians' digital
experience and enhancing patient access to preventative care and medical wellness. We operate an IT
development center in Denmark, which for example has developed broadly applicable patient interfaces
like SYNLAB Access and tailor-made customer solutions, which were used for our cooperation with UEFA
across 50 countries.

As of December 31, 2022, we owned or had the right to a limited number of trademarks or trade names
related to our business.

We operate under several different business names, trademarks and service brands. We have consolidated
a large portion of our business under the "SYNLAB" name. When acquiring new laboratories, we often
continues to operate for a period of time under the business name of the acquired laboratory in order to gain
access to its customer base and reap the benefit of the prestige associated with the trademark or business
name of the laboratory concerned, before co-branding the existing name with SYNLAB and eventually
fully transitioning the laboratory to the SYNLAB brand.

Our trademarks are of value to our business, but, other than the "SYNLAB" trademark, we do not believe
that any of our other business names, service brands and trademarks are essential for our business activities
or that any single trademark other than our "SYNLAB" brand name is material to our business as a whole.
We have also registered several domain names. We actively protect our intellectual property, particularly
by registering our trademarks and business names. We also often continue to protect the trademarks of
businesses that we acquire.

In order to provide the highest quality of service to our customers, we place considerable emphasis on using
equipment at the cutting edge of technology in our laboratories. Although we design and perform new tests,
we do not have any specific research and development centers or employee categories devoted to research.
Rather, we rely in this regard on the results of the research and development data obtained by our equipment
and test suppliers. We also closely cooperate with several renowned universities.


-----

**Insurance**

We believe that the types and amounts of our existing insurance policies are adequate in terms of both
amounts covered and conditions of coverage to cover the major risks of our business, taking into account
the cost of insurance coverage and the potential risks to business operations. However, there can be no
assurance that no losses will be incurred or that this coverage will be sufficient to cover the cost of defense
or damages in the event of a significant claim. In addition, longer interruptions of operations in one or more
of our laboratories can, even if insured, result in loss of sales, profit, customers and market share.

We maintain insurance policies to cover risks for physical damage to, and loss of, our equipment and
properties and losses related to business interruption, professional and general liabilities that may arise in
the ordinary course of business. We also maintain liability coverage for directors and officers. These
policies are generally renewed annually.

We also maintain various other insurance policies to cover a number of other risks related to our business,
such as employment practices, accident and sickness, automobile liability and physical damage and
employers' liability, as well as general excess liability policies that reimburse us in certain situations when
the limit under the applicable primary liability policy is insufficient to fully satisfy a valid claim.

**Legal and Arbitration Proceedings**

There are not and have not been any governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings, nor are we aware of
such proceedings pending or threatened, that may have or have in the previous twelve months significant
effects on our financial position or profitability.

In the course of our business, we are involved in ordinary course litigation and we may in the future be
involved in material contentious proceedings (including administrative, judiciary, arbitration and
disciplinary proceedings) relating to matters concerning the professional liability of our laboratories,
disputes with laboratory doctors, medical doctors and employees and regulatory issues, as well as enquiries
initiated by, and settlements with, regulatory authorities, prosecutors, professional associations and health
insurers, regarding, among other things, billing matters and independent contracting. We also operate in a
regulated business sector and, as such, are subject, in the ordinary course of our business, to particular
controls and supervision by the competent national or local healthcare authorities. Regulations with which
we must comply may increase our costs or restrict our activities. Failure to comply with such regulations
may lead to sanctions of various types. Future alterations to regulations that apply to us could have a
material adverse impact on our business.

We set aside provisions where there is a sufficient probability of the litigation in question leading to costs
for us or any of our subsidiaries. There were other provisions of €34.3 million set aside as of December 31,
2022 and €31.0 million as of September 30, 2023. These other provisions mainly relate to provisions for
litigation. In the normal conduct of its business, the Group is involved in legal proceedings relating to
different matters: anti-trust, personnel, damages, and other claims with uncertainties about the amount or
timing of the outflows. For example, on December 13, 2022, the Portuguese Competition Authority
("PCA") accused the largest medical laboratories in Portugal, including the Target and its Portuguese
subsidiary, of a number of collusive practices between 2016 and 2022 relating to the provision of clinical
analysis and SARS-CoV-2 tests to both public and private healthcare providers. Although we have
submitted procedural objections to the Portuguese Court of Appeals in regard to the PCA's inspection of
our premises and the seizure of correspondences, the PCA's investigation is at its final stages and it may
adopt a final decision or a settlement may be reached by December 2023, which may result in fines on our
Portuguese subsidiary. Moreover, in March 2022, a professional union of biologists in France summoned
SEL Synlab Paris and the company Synlab France before the Paris judicial court. This union seeks before
the Paris judicial court the judicial winding-up of the SEL Synlab Paris on the ground that the shareholding
of this SEL would be in breach of Article L. 6223-5. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the court
proceedings are still ongoing.

**Material Contracts**

**_NHS Pathology Partnership Contract Agreements_**

In November 2020, we entered into a partnership agreement with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation
Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust to become the London trusts' new pathology


-----

partner and transform and deliver pathology services across South East London for 15 years beginning in
the second quarter of 2021 with an option to extend for an additional five years. The partnership, named
"Synnovis," with the South East London NHS trusts includes a number of agreements that were finalized
in the first quarter of 2021, with services commencing in the second quarter of 2021. The contract presents
a range of opportunities through additional contracts with the NHS trust, further exposure and enhanced
reputation and utilization of expanded scale and infrastructure in London.

The South East London tender in 2021 was valued at £1,865 million over 15 years, with ancillary revenue
from agreements with third parties expected to take the cumulative direct and indirect revenue of the
contract above £3 billion. We expect to perform approximately 32 million tests per year for these two NHS
trusts, which oversee healthcare for 2.2 million people.

**REGULATION**

_In_ _all the countries in which we operate, the medical diagnostic market (including clinical laboratory tests)_
_is subject to stringent regulation and is supervised by various regulatory bodies. This regulation and_
_supervision strongly influence the way in which we operate. With respect to clinical laboratories, this_
_regulation primarily relates to operating standards, the professional qualifications laboratory staff must_
_hold, restrictions on equity interests in companies operating laboratories and their corporate governance_
_(which restrictions are noticeably stringent in France), and the prices, and the reimbursement of clinical_
_laboratory tests. By way of illustration, in some countries, regulations on owning and operating_
_laboratories require each laboratory or small group of laboratories to be held through a separate_
_subsidiary. In some countries such as France, the regulations also govern the legal form of the entities via_
_which laboratories may be held._

_Our operations are also subject to numerous other legal and regulatory provisions, in particular with_
_respect to the handling and storing of certain chemical products and reagents, the disposal of infectious_
_healthcare waste, the handling and storing of personal data (notably the patients' medical information) and_
_the prevention of fraud to social security systems._

**Data Protection Regulation within the EU/EEA**

In the European Union and the European Economic Area, the principles on the legitimate processing of
personal data are laid down in the GDPR. Compared to the predecessor Data Protection Directive
(95/46/EC), the GDPR entails significantly stricter requirements for data mapping and accountability,
transparency, data subject rights, processor (service provider) obligations, and the requirement to designate
a data protection officer. In addition, the GDPR and local data protection rules (such as the German Federal
Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, "BDSG") provide strict requirements on the processing of
sensitive personal data (so-called special categories of personal data), like genetic and health data of
individuals, including on the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure
security of this data. The GDPR and the BDSG introduced substantial sanctions for non-compliance and,
depending on the nature of the infringed provision, may consist of civil liabilities, cease-and-desist orders
from competitors, criminal sanctions and/or administrative fines, and adverse publicity and reputational
damages. Administrative fines can amount to €20 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual revenue
of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, for each violation. Even the perception of privacy
concerns, whether valid or not, may harm our reputation. The occurrence of any of these risks could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We have implemented an internal data protection organization, including the appointment of data protection
officers and have a robust data protection framework in place that is based on the GDPR and/or similar data
protection regulation in non-EU jurisdictions.

Furthermore, based on the EU and German Data and Digital Strategies, there are several initiatives pending
and new laws passed aimed at establishing a single, uniform digital European market with robust
cybersecurity requirements, including the Digital Services Act, the Data Act, the Directive EU 2022/2557
on the resilience of critical entities (so-called NIS2 Directive), the Cyber Resilience Act and the Artificial
Intelligence Act as well as the draft laws specifically targeting the health sectors, such as the German Digital
Act (Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur Beschleunigung der Digitalisierung des Gesundheitswesens). Overall,
implementing and complying with these laws may lead to us incurring higher costs or having to change our
business practices in this respect.

**France**

**_Description of the Regulations Applicable in France_**

_Applicable Rules to the Operation of Clinical Laboratories_

In France, the establishment and operation of clinical laboratories historically required an administrative
authorization. This authorization was issued by the relevant departmental prefects, after review of an
application that described in detail the premises, equipment, performed tests and operating procedures of
each laboratory, as well as the professional qualifications of the laboratory staff (including laboratory
doctors), the governance of the laboratory and its corporate form. The regulations set minimal standards to
be met in each of these areas. While the authorization was not issued for a limited period of time, it could


-----

be withdrawn if the legal requirements for operating a clinical laboratory ceased to be fulfilled. Any change
in the above had to be notified to the competent administrative authorities.

Since a January 13, 2010 Ordinance (ordonnance n°2010-49 relative à la biologie médicale), as amended,
companies contemplating opening a clinical laboratory must now obtain, instead of an authorization issued
by departmental prefects, an accreditation delivered by the French Committee for Accreditation (COFRAC)
and notify their activity to the ARS (Agence régionale de santé) prior to the opening of the clinical
laboratory.

The Law n°2020-734 of June 17, 2020 (and Ministerial Orders of July 16, 2020 and March 8, 2021)
clarified that the accreditation must cover all medical biology activities carried out by clinical laboratories.

A transitional regime has been introduced. Under this regime, existing administrative authorizations,
granted before the publication of the Ordinance n° 2010-49 of January 13, 2010, are to remain in force until
the clinical laboratories that hold them are accredited. New authorizations can no longer be issued as of the
date of the publication of the ordinance, except in a very small number of cases, and under certain
conditions, in the context of the restructuring of existing laboratories or site openings.

At the same time, accreditation is gradually being made compulsory, in the following manner:

- since November 1, 2016, clinical laboratories are no longer allowed to operate without an
accreditation covering 50% of the clinical tests they perform (or at least clinical laboratories must
have initiated the accreditation process before October 31, 2016, for 50% of the tests they carry out
including at least one test within each category of clinical tests, in which case they could continue to
operate until they were given an answer about their accreditation application by COFRAC and until
December 31, 2017, at the latest).

Initially, there were two possible options for entering the accreditation process: route A, consisting of
in a partial COFRAC accreditation (option chosen by 48% of French clinical laboratories) and route
B, consisting in a 36-month "Bio Quality" recognition (option chosen by 52% of French clinical
laboratories). All of the Group's SELs (except one) have chosen route A as it is a longer lasting
solution under the transitional provisions. Laboratories that opted for route B must apply to COFRAC
for accreditation by no later than April 30, 2015. Fewer than 20% of laboratories that opted for route
B had filed an accreditation application on November 1, 2014. The mandatory deadline stipulated by
the Law of May 30, 2013 has had the effect of accelerating consolidation in the French clinical
laboratory market, as the laboratories experiencing difficulties in their accreditation process were
forced to merge rapidly with accredited structures. Based on discussions with the various market
operators, the Group stands out clearly as the network with the highest number of accredited
laboratories.

The accreditation process were to be addressed to COFRAC by any non-accredited laboratory no later
than May 31, 2013, and; in the event of an incomplete application, the non-accredited laboratory's
application were to be regularized no later than October 31, 2013.

In 2015, each clinical laboratory had to submit to COFRAC either an initial request for accreditation
which will cover at least 50% of the clinical tests that it carries out, or, for clinical laboratories already
having a partial accreditation, an accreditation extension request to cover at least 50 % of accredited
tests by April 30, 2015. In both circumstances, accreditation must apply to at least one test within each
category of clinical test that the laboratory carries out; and

- since November 1, 2021, clinical laboratories are no longer allowed to carry out clinical tests
corresponding to a group of tests called "ligne de portée" without having requested or obtained from
COFRAC an accreditation covering this _ligne de portée. The deadline has initially been set at_
November 1, 2020 and was extended (i.e., to November 1, 2021) due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
pursuant to the Law n°2020-734 of June 17, 2020 and Ministerial Order of June 1, 2021.

The Law n°2020-734 of June 17, 2020 and the Ministerial Orders of July 16, 2020 and March 8, 2021
simplified the accreditation process. Instead of issuing accreditation to every single clinical test carried
out by clinical laboratories, COFRAC would issue accreditations by lignes de portée (a ligne de portée
corresponds to a group of clinical tests with similar features and a common accreditation methodology
of assessment). Each ligne de portée has representative tests and related professional skills. When


-----

COFRAC issues an accreditation to representative tests, all clinical tests included in the same group
(ligne de portée) are considered compliant with the obligation to acquire accreditation. The French
National Commission for Medical Biology (Commission nationale de biologie médicale, CNBM)
suggests to the French Health Minister the representative tests and common professional skills
associated with each _ligne de portée to be accredited. The representative tests and common_
professional skills associated with each ligne de portée have been listed by the French Health Minister
in a Ministerial Order dated March 8, 2021.

A clinical laboratory is considered accredited when all of its _lignes de portée are accredited by_
COFRAC.

Accreditation under ISO 15189 (the international quality standard for clinical laboratories) is delivered by
COFRAC. According to the accreditation rules (règlement d'accréditation) of COFRAC, in the latest
version published on October 15, 2022 (SH REF 05 – Révision 16), the very first accreditation of a clinical
laboratory is set to expire within four years following its delivery and is subject to regular on-site audits
(the first on-site audit must be carried out at the latest twelve months after the entry into force of the first
accreditation and then on-site audits must be carried out at least every fifteen months during the first four
years), for so long as the first accreditation is in force. At the end of this first four-year period, a renewal
audit is then undertaken and, if satisfactory, a no higher than five-year accreditation is delivered and remains
subject to regular on-site audits (they must be carried out at least every twenty-three months). COFRAC
may suspend or withdraw a clinical laboratory's accreditation for all or part of the laboratory's business if
it fails to comply with applicable requirements or in the event of fraud, intentional concealment of
information or disclosure of false information.

The mandatory timeline stipulated by the Law of May 30, 2013 (as modified by the subsequent regulations)
has had the effect of accelerating consolidation in the French clinical laboratory market, as the laboratories
experiencing difficulties with their accreditation process were forced to merge rapidly with accredited
structures.

The ARSs, as the competent administrative authorities in France, are responsible for ensuring that clinical
laboratories comply with existing sanitary and safety regulations through on-site inspections. Any change
in the operating conditions of a laboratory or in the legal or financial structure of the company operating
the laboratory must be notified to the competent ARS(s). In addition, some tests or categories of tests are
controlled by specialized agencies as part of an annual quality control program. The ARSs may impose
administrative sanctions on SELs, as well as, in certain instances, on laboratory doctors and on third parties
(e.g., prohibited investors), that infringe certain provisions of the applicable regulation (in particular, health,
safety and quality requirements). These sanctions range from fines (potentially up to €2 million per SEL)
to the temporary or permanent closure of the laboratory, in the case of particularly serious or repeated
violations.

The operation of laboratories is restricted, as described below, based on administrative geographic areas
that are defined by each ARS ("zones").

A clinical laboratory can be located on one or several sites. There is no limit under French law to the number
of sites that a clinical laboratory may operate, insofar as the clinical laboratory has an accreditation for all
groups of clinical tests (lignes de portée) or requested it. However, sites of a clinical laboratory cannot be
located in more than three adjacent zones (as defined by the competent ARS(s)), barring an exemption
granted by the general director of the competent ARS under the conditions set out by Article R. 6222-4 of
the French Public Health Code and included in the regional health organization plan (schéma regional de
_santé)._

The competent ARS can, or must, reject any opening of new sites in certain cases defined by the French
Public Health Code. For instance:

- the ARS's general director may oppose the opening of a clinical laboratory or site if it would result in
an increase in the relevant zone's clinical tests' offer (offre d'examens de biologie médicale) to a level
25% higher than the population's needs, as defined by the regional health organization plan.

- They may also oppose, on grounds related to the risk of affecting the continuity of clinical testing
availability, an acquisition or restructuring (including a merger) affecting a clinical laboratory or site
when this acquisition or restructuring would result in the number of tests performed by the laboratory


-----

resulting from the acquisition or restructuring exceeding the threshold of 25% of all clinical tests
carried out in the relevant zone.

- Finally, the acquisition of shares of companies operating a clinical laboratory is not authorized when
such an acquisition would enable a person or entity to control, directly or indirectly, a portion of the
clinical tests' offer higher than 33% of all clinical tests carried out in the same zone. A person or entity
is deemed to control more than 33% of all clinical tests carried out in a zone if they own, directly or
indirectly, the majority of the share capital of several companies operating a clinical laboratory, and
the combined business of those companies represents more than 33% of all clinical tests in that zone.

French law also limits the number of tests that can be outsourced by one clinical laboratory to another for
analysis and interpretation every year to 15% of the total number of tests carried out by the outsourcing
laboratory. Subcontracting contracts must be registered with the competent ARS and professional
associations (Ordres) (and the ministry of defense if applicable). Clinical laboratories, however, are free to
distribute the tests to be carried out between their various sites as they wish. They can even concentrate the
performance of all tests in a single site.

Laboratory doctors (biologistes médicaux) (qualified doctors or pharmacists), laboratory technicians and
nurses who collect samples taken from patients must meet minimum professional qualifications.

In France, each clinical laboratory must be supervised by at least one laboratory doctor (called the
responsible laboratory doctor (biologiste-responsable)) who acts as the legal representative of the
laboratory company operating the laboratory. This laboratory doctor is responsible for the laboratory's
operations, including the processing of tests outsourced to other laboratories. A laboratory doctor can hold
the position of responsible or co-responsible laboratory doctor in only one laboratory. Each of a laboratory's
sites must also be supervised during its opening hours by a laboratory doctor who can be identified at all
times and who can intervene within a timeframe that is compatible with the guarantee of patients' safety.
Hence any laboratory shall have a number of laboratory doctors equal to at least the number of sites that it
has created.

Laboratory doctors working in laboratories are subject to the same rules of professional conduct as doctors
and pharmacists, depending on the professional association (Ordre) they are members of. Laboratory
doctors must be registered with the relevant Ordre (the Ordre des pharmaciens for qualified pharmacists
and the Ordre des médecins for qualified medical doctors). Companies operating a clinical laboratory must
also be registered with either one or both Ordres, based on the professional affiliation of the laboratory
doctors practicing within the laboratories they operate.

The professional associations (the Ordres) are self-regulating bodies with administrative and disciplinary
powers over practicing doctors and pharmacists, and over the companies that have registered with them.
They also represent the collective interests of pharmacists (in the case of the Ordre des pharmaciens) and
medical doctors (in the case of the Ordre des médecins), including, in both cases, the interests of laboratory
doctors, before French public authorities. These Ordres may be called upon to issue opinions on certain
issues involving their profession, including when bills and regulations are being drafted. They also monitor
compliance with applicable laws, regulations and rules of professional conduct by practicing professionals
and professional companies.

The principle of independence, defined respectively for pharmacists and doctors in articles R. 4235-18 and
R. 4127-5 of the French Public Health Code, is one of the professional conduct rules enforced by the
_Ordres. Under this principle, a pharmacist must not be subject to any financial, commercial, technical or_
moral constraint, if such constraint could impair his or her professional independence. As for medical
doctors, article R. 4127-5 of the French Public Health Code provides that a medical doctor cannot, in any
manner whatsoever, compromise his or her professional independence. When the responsible laboratory
doctor thinks that the decisions taken by a physical or legal person operating a clinical laboratory could
endanger patients' health, public health or the operating rules of the laboratory provided for in the French
Public Health Code, the responsible laboratory doctor informs the general director of the competent ARS,
who will then take appropriate measures.

The Ordre des pharmaciens and the Ordre des médecins maintain, as far as each is concerned, a register of
practicing professionals (tableau de l'Ordre), on which every practicing pharmacist, doctor and professional
company must be registered, thereby regulating access to the profession. New companies operating clinical


-----

laboratories must apply for registration in the relevant register. An _Ordre_ may withhold or suspend
registration if it notices that the applicant has breached the relevant rules of professional conduct.

Clinical laboratories are subject to ongoing regulatory supervision by the Ordres and must therefore submit
certain proposed actions to the relevant Ordre or Ordres for review. These actions include any proposed
change in the share capital or in the articles of association (statuts) of the companies that operate the
laboratories, any cooperation contract entered into with other clinical laboratories and, more generally, any
agreement relating to the operations of laboratories or governing relations between their shareholders. After
reviewing this information, the Ordres may inform the ARSs of any breaches of the regulations. The ARSs
are not bound by the findings of the Ordres in this respect.

Each professional _Ordre, using its administrative and disciplinary powers, may impose administrative_
measures and disciplinary sanctions on professional companies and laboratory doctors (doctors or
pharmacists). An _Ordre_ may especially delist a professional company from the register (Tableau de
_l'Ordre) and temporarily or permanently suspend practicing laboratory doctors who have breached rules of_
professional conduct.

Certain illegal activities, including the illegal practice of clinical biology and the misleading use of the title
of laboratory doctor, carry criminal penalties that range from a prohibition from practicing clinical biology
or operating a clinical laboratory, to imprisonment for natural persons.

Clinical laboratories may not advertise their services, directly or indirectly, to the general public. However,
scientific information given to medical doctors and pharmacists, the public announcement of the existence
and location of a clinical laboratory published at the time of its opening or the opening of its sites, and
references to the accreditation of a laboratory, are excluded from this prohibition.

With regard to pricing and reimbursement, clinical laboratories are bound by the prices set by the Union
_nationale des caisses d'assurance maladie (UNCAM). These prices are revised regularly following_
negotiations between the UNCAM and professional biologists' trade unions and approved by the Ministries
of Health and Social Affairs. Several agreements have been signed by the main French professional
biologists' trade unions and UNCAM to regulate prices regarding clinical laboratories activity. An
agreement was signed on October 10, 2013, by the main French professional biologists' trade unions and
UNCAM following the government's announcement in 2012 of its plan to cut healthcare spending on
French clinical laboratories by at least €110 million. The agreement aims to map out the business prospects
of clinical laboratories for a three-year period while continuing to control healthcare spending. It aims to
limit annual growth in clinical spending to 0.25% between 2014 and 2016, through moderate, gradual rate
reductions and control over prescriptions, in order to offset natural volume growth. Professional unions
meet with UNCAM every six months to measure the impact of enacted rate changes and to determine the
upcoming changes that may need to be made to achieve the annual growth target. In January 2016, on the
basis of 2015 figures and information about the trend in early 2016, UNCAM decided to implement a
decrease in rates applicable as from April 20, 2016. A further temporary decrease in rates between
November 15, 2016, and December 31, 2016, was agreed between UNCAM and professional unions to
slow down the fast growth recorded during the first nine months of 2016. In 2016, UNCAM and
professional unions also agreed on November 7, 2016, on the extension of the three-year agreement for
another three-year period (2017-2019 included), at the same annual growth targeted limit of 0.25%, with a
revised system for better managing semi-annual adjustments. In order to reach the annual growth targeted
limit, UNCAM decided to implement again a temporary decrease in rates between November 20, 2018 and
December 31, 2018. A new agreement was signed on March 11, 2020 between the main French
professional biologists' trade unions and UNCAM which extends for three more years (2020-2022) the
previous agreement and amends it. The targeted maximal annual growth in clinical spending is increased
to 0.4% in 2020, 0.5% in 2021 and 0.6% in 2022. It also aims at taking into account the impact of health
crisis or of public health decisions on clinical spending. An agreement has been signed on January 10, 2023
between the main French professional biologists' trade unions and UNCAM to implement a decrease in
rates applicable from February 1, 2023. In addition, an agreement signed on July 27, 2023 aims to limit
annual growth in clinical spending to 0.4% between 2024 and 2026. This agreement is still subject to
amendments.

Patients are reimbursed for expenses for clinical tests if the performed tests are registered upon a
predetermined list set by the UNCAM and the tests have been prescribed in compliance with applicable
rules. The French authorities may be tempted in the future to extend the scope of the clinical tests which do


-----

not give rise to a reimbursement by the public health insurance funds, hence resulting in a significant
decrease of the related prescriptions and revenue.

There is a different regime for laboratories to obtain payment for tests performed at the request of the patient
without a prescription. Such clinical tests are not subject to reimbursement by UNCAM. Instead, they are
paid for directly by the patient. When the relevant medical biologist performs such tests, he should inform
the patient of their non-reimbursable nature and requests his agreement to carry them out. The same applies
where the tests have been prescribed but are not reimbursable.

_Restrictions on the Ownership and Corporate Governance of Companies Operating Clinical Laboratories_

French laws and regulations impose restrictions on the ownership and corporate governance structure of
companies operating a clinical laboratory.

Almost all of our clinical laboratories in France are operated by SELASs (société d'exercice libéral par
_actions simplifiée)_ which are a specific category of SELs. This kind of company is governed, in particular,
by the following principles:

- a SEL, as any company operating a clinical laboratory, shall be registered on the national register of
the _Ordre des médecins_ (French physicians order) and/or the _Ordre des pharmaciens_ (French
pharmacists order) and is then also governed by the professional rules of ethics applicable to doctors
and/or pharmacists;

- the _président_ (president) and _dirigeants_ (i.e., the other corporate officers) of a SELAS shall be
laboratory doctors who are shareholders of that SEL and who practice within that SEL;

- more than half of the share capital and voting rights of a SEL shall be held, directly or indirectly
(through specific companies), by laboratory doctors practicing within that SEL pursuant to the Law
of December 31, 1990, on SELs, and article L. 6223-8, I, of the French Public Health Code.

The remaining shares and voting rights of a SEL may be held by professionals practicing the same
profession, which may be either natural persons (e.g., laboratory doctors who do not practice within this
SEL) or legal entities (e.g., companies operating clinical laboratories).

The Law of December 31, 1990, on SELs will be replaced as of September 1, 2024 by the Ordinance of
February 8, 2023. SELs will be subject to Books I and III of Ordinance of February 8, 2023 and have until
September 1, 2025 to comply with its provisions (with the exception of Article 44 (see below), which will
apply as of September 1[st], 2024, and implementing decrees relating to requirements applicable to the
shareholding and voting rights (the shareholders of the SEL will have two years after the date of the entry
into force of said decrees to comply with their provisions).

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, this ordinance does not change the above-mentioned rules.
In particular, Article 46 of the Ordinance of February 8, 2023 confirms the above-mentioned shareholding
requirements and Article L. 6223-8 of the French Public Health Code was updated accordingly. Similarly,
Article 61 of the same ordinance confirms that the president and other corporate officers of a SELAS shall
be laboratory doctors who are shareholders of that SEL and practice within that SEL.

The law applicable to SELs of biologists and pathologists may further change. On the one hand, the French
Parliament could decide to revise the legislative provisions created by the Ordinance of February 8, 2023.
In accordance with Article 7, II, of the law no. 2022-172 of February 14, 2022, the French Government
filed on July 5, 2023 a bill that aims at ratifying the Ordinance of February 8, 2023. As of
November 6, 2023, the French Parliament has not yet started to review this bill. The French Parliament
could decide to amend the legislative provisions created by this Ordinance of February 8, 2023 during its
ratification process or refuse to ratify this ordinance. On the other hand, the French Government needs to
adopt implementing decrees in application of the Ordinance of February 8, 2023. The content of these
decrees could affect the regulatory provisions applicable to SELs. These decrees cover a large number of
subjects, including the communication of information by the SELs to the professional orders on the
composition of the share capital and voting rights of the company (Article 44), rules on the so-called
prohibited investors (Article 48), and rules on the percentage of the share capital of a SEL that may be held
by a non-biologist shareholder (Article 70). Finally, ordinances, prior to the expiry of the deadline set for
their ratification, may be challenged before the Council of State, which may annul them partially or totally.


-----

Between this date and their ratification by the French Parliament, ordinances may be challenged before the
Constitutional Council and/or the Council of State.

Article 32 of Law No. 2001-1168 of December 11, 2001 (the "MURCEF Law") modified Law of
December 31, 1990 by introducing therein an article 5-1 which effect was to open up to people outside
SELs, namely laboratory doctors practicing outside the SEL or investment holdings of liberal practitioners
(société de participations financières de professions libérales, or "SPFPL"), the possibility to own more
than half of the share capital of the SEL, while requiring that the majority of voting rights remain in the
hands of laboratory doctors working in the SEL (this is the so-called "5-1 derogation"). Subject to
derogations (see below), Law of May 30, 2013 put an end to the applicability of this exemption (see
paragraph I of Article L. 6223-8 of the French Public Health Code).

However, pursuant to paragraph II of article L. 6223-8 of the French Public Health Code, SELs of
laboratory doctors that had a different capital ownership structure when the Law of May 30, 2013 was
promulgated (i.e., of which more than half of the share capital was held by persons other than laboratory
doctors practicing within the SEL) benefit from a grandfathering exception that allows them to keep their
existing structure, so that laboratory doctors who do not practice within these SELs and companies that
operate clinical laboratories can continue to hold a majority stake in their share capital (but not in their
voting rights).

Thus, since 2013, so-called "derogatory" SELs and "non-derogatory" SELs coexist:

- Non-derogatory SELs are either those created before the promulgation of Law of May 30, 2013 but
which did not use the 5-1 derogation before this date, or those created since this date. The majority of
the share capital of these SELs is therefore held, directly or indirectly, by laboratory doctors working
within the SEL;

- Derogatory SELs created prior to the promulgation of Law of May 30, 2013 which used the 5-1
derogation, and are therefore not directly or indirectly majority owned by laboratory doctors working
within them.

Paragraph II of article L. 6223-8 of the French Public Health Code gives the laboratory doctors practicing
within the derogatory SELs who qualify for the grandfathering exception a priority right should shares of
the SEL in which they practice be put up for sale. Article R. 6223-65 of the same Code specifies that, if the
laboratory doctors practicing within the SEL cannot purchase the proposed shares or have not expressed
their willingness to acquire the transferred shares by the end of a period of two months following the date
of receipt of a notification sent to them by the legal representative of the company, such shares can be
proposed to any natural person or legal entity practicing the profession of laboratory doctor or to any SPFPL
(within the limit of 25% of the share capital, as mentioned below). The company's legal representative may
not decide to sell to these aforementioned persons/entities at a more advantageous price or conditions
without first emitting another offer to the benefit of the laboratory doctors practicing within the SEL in
accordance with the above. In any case, a copy of the notification(s) is sent to the relevant Ordre and to the
general director of the relevant ARS.

Any sale of shares carried out in breach of the above is unenforceable _vis-à-vis the company, and its_
shareholders.

All French SELs are derogatory ones, except for one (Bionyval), which will be merged early 2024.

While the applicable regulation refers to sale of shares (cession), the competent administrative authorities
could interpret this regime as preventing some forms of restructuring, such as those involving a universal
transfer of all assets where the acquired SEL is not a derogatory SEL. Such interpretation, which seems to
be the one adopted by the French Ministry of Health and Prevention, some ARSs and some trade unions,
may make some forms of restructuring of SELs within the SYNLAB Group, or other mergers with SELs
outside the SYNLAB Group, more complex or prevent them outright. Nevertheless, it is market practice
for SELs covered by the grandfathering exception to absorb SELs that are not covered by it and consider
that, as a result, the combined entity resulting from the merger keeps benefiting from the grandfathering
exception. In an opinion no. 19-A-08 dated April 4, 2019, the French Competition Authority confirmed that
"a derogatory SEL may absorb a non-derogatory SEL, as a result of a merger, thus allowing all existing
_derogatory structures to expand their chain of laboratories. A SEL which is absorbed by another is_
_dissolved and integrated into the absorbing SEL, which results in the loss of its derogatory or non-_


-----

_derogatory status" (point 1303) free translation). In addition, the Bordeaux administrative court of appeal_
clarified in a ruling issued in 2020 that (i) the ARS have, when certain authorizations are sought or modified
in the course of a merger, to examine whether the contemplated operation would comply with all applicable
provisions of the French Public Health Code, and (ii) the ARS cannot, in this context, refuse to grant such
authorization or to modify it on the ground that the absorption, as a result of a merger, of a non-derogatory
SEL by a derogatory SEL brings the laboratories at issue under the control of a SEL in which non-biologists
hold a majority stake (CAA Bordeaux, 23 June 2020, case 18BX00491).

In cases where a laboratory SEL fails to comply with the capital and voting rights requirements of the Law
of December 31, 1990, the laboratory SEL must ensure its compliance within one year. Failing this, any
interested party may ask the tribunal for the dissolution of the laboratory SEL. The tribunal may grant a
maximum six-month delay to allow the laboratory SEL to meet the requirements for compliance. As a result
of the entry into force of the Ordinance of February 8, 2023, this rule will apply in cases where a laboratory
SEL fails to comply with the capital and voting rights or governance requirements set by Articles 56 to 67
of the Ordinance of February 8, 2023 (Article 53 of Ordinance of February 8, 2023).

Law of December 31, 1990, on SELs was modified by the Macron Law. The purpose of the Macron Law
was to modify the limitations of capital ownership and corporate governance of SELs other than clinical
laboratory SELs (i.e., SELs of technicians and lawyers). However, the Macron Law also created
ambiguities on the regime governing clinical laboratory SELs because it added the paragraph 6° to sublimb B of limb I of Article 5 of Law of December 31, 1990, under which the shares of a SEL that are not
held by laboratory doctors working within the SEL may be held, apart notably from professionals practicing
the same profession, by a laboratory company established in a Member State of the European
Union/European Economic Area (EEA)/Swiss Confederation that notably "complies, directly or indirectly
_through another intermediary legal entity, with the requirements on holding of capital and voting rights_
_provided by this Law" (free translation) (i.e., Law of December 31, 1990). It cannot be excluded that this_
provision may be interpreted as prohibiting a corporate structuring, as the one developed by SYNLAB,
where the majority of the share capital of the French SELs is held through European laboratory companies,
if it is not demonstrated that these European laboratory companies comply with the restrictions on the
holding of share capital and voting rights provided by French Law. The practical implications of this piece
of legislation remain unclear, but it could be considered, notably, that this new provision should not apply
to the SELs covered by the grandfathering exception, as is the case for SYNLAB. In the absence of a
position from the administrative authorities or the judge (this argument was raised by the _Syndicat des_
_biologistes in the course of legal proceedings before the administrative court of Bordeaux, but only as an_
element of context and the ruling does not cover this point), the potential impact of the Macron Law on the
current corporate structure of laboratory groups in France, including SYNLAB, remains undetermined.
Under Article 47 of Ordinance of February 8, 2023, so-called "European persons" may own the rest of the
share capital. A "European person" is defined, under Article 4 of the same ordinance, as a natural person or
legal entity established in an EU Member State other than France, a party State to the EEA or in Swiss
Confederation and which practices, in of these States, activity which presents the characteristics of a
regulated profession within the meaning of the ordinance. If it is controlled, partially or totally, by another
legal entity, it must respect the requirements provided under the ordinance as regards the holding of share
capital and voting rights (Article 47 of Ordinance of February 8, 2023). natural persons or legal entities that
are neither laboratory doctors, nor laboratory companies, cannot, pursuant to Article R. 6223-64 of the
French Public Health Code, hold more than 25% of the share capital of a SELAS (this limit was confirmed
by a decision of the European Court of Justice on 16 December 2010 (case C-89/09));

A cap limiting to two the number of SELs in which shares may be held by the same natural or legal person
practicing, outside the SEL, the profession constituting the latter's corporate purpose or by professionals
exercising a profession in the health profession other than the SEL's was formerly provided for by article
R. 6212-81 of the Public Health Code, but was deleted by a decree of February 5, 2013 following the
abovementioned ruling.

According to Article 70 of Ordinance of February 8, 2023, decrees may provide that non laboratory doctors
may collectively hold less than 50% of the share capital of SELAS, without being authorized to individually
hold more than 25% of the share capital. As mentioned above, the French Government has not yet adopted
the relevant decree. This future decree will replace the current regulatory provisions set by Article R. 622364 of the French Public Health Code.

- finally, to prevent any conflict of interest, Article L. 6223-5 of the French Public Health Code forbids
the following persons (the "prohibited investors"), from holding, whether directly or indirectly, a


-----

fraction of the share capital of a private company operating a French clinical laboratory (and not only
SELs):

(i) a natural or legal person practicing as a healthcare practitioner (except for laboratory doctors),
or operating as provider, distributor or manufacturer of medical devices or in vitro diagnostic
medical devices, or operating as a private healthcare institution or as a social or medico-social
institution governed by private law, or operating as an insurance or capitalization company
or as a welfare, retirement or mandatory or elective social security institution;

(ii) an natural or legal person holding 10% or more of the share capital of a company which
provides, distributes or manufactures medical devices or in vitro diagnostic medical devices,
or which operates as an insurance or capitalization company or as a, welfare, retirement or
mandatory or elective social security institution; and

(iii) any natural or legal person holding, whether directly or indirectly, a fraction of the share
capital of a company of healthcare practitioners which is authorized to take samples under
the conditions mentioned under Article L. 6211-13 of the French Public Health Code and
which does not meet the conditions of chapter II of title I of book II ("Clinical testing") of
part 6 of the legislative part of the French Public Health Code (i.e., articles L. 6212-1 to L.
6212-6 of the French Public Health Code on the qualification of a clinical laboratory).

Ordinance of February 8, 2023 did not change the provisions of Article L. 6223-5 of the French Public
Health Code.

_Rules Governing Anatomical Pathology Laboratories_

Lastly, it should be noted that SELs that operate anatomical pathology laboratories are SELs of medical
doctors, and are therefore subject to substantially similar rules to those applicable to the SELs which operate
clinical laboratories.

In particular, the restrictions on ownership and corporate governance structure are relatively similar. In this
respect, it is noteworthy that, in order to prevent certain conflicts of interest, any equity interest (whether
direct or indirect) in SELs that operate anatomical pathology laboratories is also prohibited for various
categories of natural persons and legal entities. This prohibition includes laboratory doctors and companies
operating clinical laboratories. To comply with this regulation, we have set up a corporate structure that
enables us to hold SELs that operate anatomical pathology laboratories through some of our subsidiaries
that are not affected by this prohibition.

A key difference with the SELs which operate clinical laboratories is that, to date, the majority of the share
capital (but not of the voting rights) of SELs that operate anatomical pathology laboratories may be held
by physicians not practicing in these SELs or companies of physicians. There is no need to rely on
derogatory SELs or a grandfathering exception. In addition, physicians and SELs of physicians can only be
shareholders of two SELs.

**_Impact of Regulations Applicable to Our Corporate Structure_**

Our French subsidiaries that operate clinical laboratories (in the form of SELAS) are held directly and
indirectly through an Italian laboratory company, and our foreign subsidiaries are held indirectly through
several national holding companies and other laboratory companies.

In France, as described above, ownership of the share capital and voting rights of SELs operating clinical
laboratories and their corporate governance structure are highly regulated. In particular, the majority of
voting rights of the SELs must be held by laboratory doctors practicing within these SELs.

In order to comply with this regulation, we have put in place:

(i) a corporate structure under which we hold about 99.9% of the share capital of the SELs
benefiting from the grandfathering exception under the Law of May 30, 2013, described above,
directly or indirectly through Istituto il Baluardo S.p.A. (an Italian subsidiary), while some of
the laboratory doctors practicing in these SELs hold the remaining shares; and


-----

(ii) the articles of association (statuts) of all of our SELs grant the majority of voting rights at all
shareholders' general meetings to laboratory doctors who are shareholders in the SELs in which
they practice.

We can no longer use this approach for most of our acquisitions implemented as from the enactment of the
Law of May 30, 2013, which has made it mandatory for more than 50% of the share capital (in addition to
50% of voting rights) of a SEL of laboratory doctors to be held by the laboratory doctors practicing in the
SEL.

We have therefore set up an alternative structure, based on issuing preferred shares within the SYNLAB
Group, in order to make acquisitions in compliance with the regulation, while enabling us to hold virtually
all the economic rights in the acquired SELs and to exercise determining influence over them. Therefore,
in all cases, we hold virtually all of the economic rights in the SELs and have put in place corporate
governance, contractual and organizational structures, in compliance with French regulation, that allow us
to fully consolidate these SELs in our financial statements.

**_Impact of the Regulation on the Corporate Governance of the SELs_**

The laboratory doctors from whom we acquire a minority stake in SELs (whether such SELs benefit from
the grandfathering exception or not) or clinical laboratories who decide to stay in the SYNLAB Group,
continue to run the SELs on a day-to-day basis.

In order to improve the coordination of operations in our clinical laboratories and consolidate our network,
we have set up a resource sharing structure in the form of a French GIE (Groupement d'intérêt économique),
SYNLAB Gestion, which encompasses all of our existing French laboratory companies and some of its
foreign companies, including SYNLAB Diagnósticos Globales, S.A., SYNLAB Belgium SRL (a Belgian
laboratory company) and Istituto il Baluardo S.p.A. (one of the Italian laboratory companies). The GIE
provides administrative support for the clinical laboratories of its members. The GIE is managed by
SYNLAB France as its sole director, appointed by a qualified (i.e., three-quarters majority) vote of the
GIE's members.

In strict compliance with French regulations governing clinical laboratories, in 2014 we began to set up a
new corporate governance, contractual and organizational structure for our French SEL subsidiaries
allowing us to fully consolidate these subsidiaries in our financial statements. Not all SELs have adopted
this governance scheme, but a significant number have.

This structure is based on a set of standard agreements (the "Operating Rules")

These Operating Rules give us the ability to de facto exercise relevant influence on the SELs' strategic and
financial operations, while strictly complying with the regulation requiring that the laboratory doctors who
practice in a SEL (the _associés professionnels internes_ or APIs) hold the majority of the voting rights
(50.01%) of such a SEL.

Furthermore, shareholders' agreements entered into with the APIs define the commitments that the APIs
accept, including an obligation to sell their shares in the SEL when they quit practicing, and a commitment
to fully participate in our development and restructuring.

We exercise a determining influence over the day-to-day management of the SELs through Strategy
Committees (Comités Stratégiques) that are set up pursuant to the shareholders' agreements. Such influence
relies on corporate governance mechanisms and contractual agreements put in place in accordance with
applicable laws. These Strategy Committees ensure the implication of representatives of the SYNLAB
Group in strategic and financial decisions. Given the contractual commitments accepted by the API parties
to the shareholders' agreements, which includes membership of GIE SYNLAB Gestion and utilization of
our central support services (e.g., accounting, finance and legal services, purchasing, IT, human resources,
scientific information and quality control), decisions proposed by us are intended to be adopted by
consensus, with a favorable vote from the APIs who are members of the Strategy Committee.

We note that the shareholders' agreements expressly provide that the commitments accepted by the APIs
shall in no way affect their professional independence and that we expressly undertake not to intervene in
the regulated clinical laboratory activities exercised under the sole responsibility of the APIs. We therefore
do not, and will never, intervene in the SELs' purely medical practice, which is under the sole responsibility
of the laboratory doctors.


-----

In case of a deadlock, which should be analyzed for the sole purpose of justifying full consolidation under
IFRS, we may use specific mechanisms provided for in the Operating Rules, where applicable.

We are not in a position to fully assess whether the mechanisms for ending a deadlock situation would
consist of any infringement of the principle of professional independence.

However, in accordance with the regulation, the documentation underlying the legal and organizational
structure is systematically sent to the supervisory authorities (professional Ordres and competent ARS)
when adopted by a SEL. Consequently, the supervisory authorities ensure that the operation of the clinical
laboratories complies with the regulations, and the professional Ordres ensure that it complies with the
applicable ethical rules. To date, none of the Operating Rules as summarized above has been challenged in
any way by the supervisory authorities.

Lastly, it should be noted in this respect that certain other legal organizational methods adopted in the past
by our SELs were criticized and sanctioned by the Governing Board of the Ordre des pharmaciens.

We contested these sanctions and filed a complaint with the European Commission in 2007. It is mainly on
this ground that the European Commission found that the Ordre des pharmaciens had sought to prevent the
development of laboratory groups in the French market, in violation of European Union rules on collusion
and restrictive commercial practices, and ordered it to pay a very substantial fine in December 2010. This
ruling was confirmed by a decision of the European Court of Justice on December 10, 2014. On March 5,
2015, the Conseil Central de la Section G, which is the body of the Ordre des pharmaciens responsible for
clinical testing, closed several disciplinary cases against us during an administrative session without taking
any further action. The closing of these cases results from a withdrawal of the complaints filed by its
president against our medical doctors and SELs. Even though these withdrawals were not motivated by any
external action, they are probably the result of the decision of the Ordre des Pharmaciens to not appeal its
conviction by the European General Court. We had introduced an action against the Ordre des Pharmaciens
before the administrative tribunal of Paris to ask for compensation for the prejudice suffered as a result of
the anti-competitive practices of the _Ordre des Pharmaciens that were criticized by the European_
Commission. A transaction protocol was signed with the Ordre des Pharmaciens and the Conseil Central
_de la Section G on December 26, 2017, allowing us to put the action introduced before the administrative_
tribunal of Paris to an end.

Separately, a professional union of biologists summoned in March 2022 the SEL Synlab Paris and the
company Synlab France to appear before the Paris judicial court. This union seeks before the Paris judicial
court the judicial winding-up of the SEL Synlab Paris on the ground that the shareholding of this SEL
would be in breach of Article L. 6223-5. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the court proceedings
are still ongoing.

Finally, the Council of State (French highest administrative court) issued on 10 July 2023 three rulings in
the veterinary sector in relation to laws and regulations that are close to those applicable to SELs of
biologists and physicians. In these rulings, the Council of State ruled that, the fact that, by requiring that
APIs hold half of the share capital and voting rights of the veterinary companies in which they practice,
French law requires that the APIs effectively control said companies. According to press statements, a
conciliation process is ongoing to clarify the meaning and implications of these rulings for groups of
veterinary clinics. The Council of State moreover endorsed an interpretation of the legislative provisions
that prohibit certain categories of persons from holding, whether directly or indirectly, a fraction of the
share capital of veterinary companies which implies that one is deemed to indirectly hold a participation in
a veterinary clinic if it controls the intermediate entity which ultimately holds the participation in the said
clinic. Although these decisions are not related to the human health sector, nor based on the Law of
December 31, 1990 or the French Public Health Code, SYNLAB cannot exclude that these interpretations
may be transposed by French courts, administrative authorities or professional orders to the medical biology
and pathology sectors, which could reinforce the position of SYNLAB when it comes to Article L. 6223-5
and Article R. 4113-13 but negatively affect the above-mentioned governance mechanisms.

This specific legal and organizational structure that we currently use, as well as the arrangements described
above, entail certain risks. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment—
_The French regulatory environment in which we operate is particularly stringent, especially in relation to_
_ownership and corporate structure of SELs (Société d'Exercice Liberal), particularly those operating_
_clinical laboratories. If regulators were to successfully challenge our existing legal structure, this could_
_have a material adverse impact on our activities."_

**Germany**

**_Laboratory Diagnostics_**

In Germany, the health insurance system distinguishes between statutory health insurance (Gesetzliche
_Krankenversicherung, "SHI") and the private health insurance (Private Krankenversicherung, "PHI")._
Approximately 90% of the German population is covered by SHI. The following discussion focuses on our
services for SHI patients and SHI reimbursement.

Outpatient medical services, including clinical laboratory testing services, to patients insured through SHI
must be provided either by physicians who are licensed by administrative order (Vertragsärzte) or by
certain non-physician service providers who are licensed by contract with the respective patient's SHI fund.
The services must be conducted under the personal supervision and control of such qualified specialists
(Prinzip der persönlichen Leistungserbringung).

We provide our laboratory testing services primarily by medical care centers (Medizinische
_Versorgungszentren, "MVZ") employing qualified physicians. Alternatively, laboratory work may be_
provided through independent (freiberuflich) office-based physicians, working as sole practitioners or in
collaboration with other qualified physicians. In addition, clinical laboratory services providers can enter
into outsourcing or other cooperation agreements to provide clinical laboratory services to hospitals.

To obtain SHI admission (vertragsärztliche Zulassung) and to thereby provide medical services to patients
insured under the SHI scheme, MVZs have to meet certain specific eligibility requirements:

- Under the previous law, each MVZ is required to offer multidisciplinary services (fachübergreifende
_Tätigkeit), which de facto requires the presence of at least two physicians with different areas of_
specialization at the same site. Pursuant to a bill which entered into force on July 23, 2015, the
operation of an MVZ no longer requires multidisciplinary services. Under the new regulation, MVZs
may be founded and continued with at least two physicians who may practice in the same discipline.

- As it is usually the case, our physicians are employees of the MVZ, however, the law also allows them
to maintain their status as SHI physicians. The employment of a physician at the MVZ must be
approved by way of an administrative order issued by the licensing committee.

- A qualified and licensed SHI physician who works at the MVZ must be free in his medical decision
and observe the requirement of personal service provision (Gebot der persönlichen
_Leistungserbringung). The articles of association of each MVZ operating company must specify that_
shareholders may not instruct physicians acting in their medical capacity.

- In every MVZ there must be a medical director (ärztlicher Leiter), either an employed physician or a
SHI physician, who is solely responsible for the organization of the entire operational processes from
a medical perspective. The medical director must be free from instructions in medical matters.

- MVZs licensed in or after 2012 must be organized in one of the following legal forms: a general
partnership under German civil law (GbR), a registered partnership (Partnerschaftsgesellschaft), a
registered cooperative (eingetragene Genossenschaft), a legal form under public law or a limited
liability company (GmbH).

- MVZs that obtained their license before 2012 benefit from a grandfathering provision pursuant to
section 95 paragraph 1a of the Social Security Code V (Sozialgesetzbuch Fünftes Buch, "SGB V").
The grandfathering rule only refers to the status quo of the MVZ (i.e., the legal form and shareholder
structure of a MVZ may only be amended into a legal form and shareholder structure which is
permissible under the new law).

- Several of our MVZs benefit from the aforementioned grandfathering provisions. This concerns
MVZs established under the former legal regime as direct subsidiaries of the holding company. In
contrast, MVZs that are directly held by Steinlach-Klinik GmbH, which is the owner of a contract
hospital (Krankenhaus mit Versorgungsvertrag), are governed by the current regulations.

- Since 2012, MVZs may only be founded and their shares held by, among others, SHI-authorized
physicians, SHI-authorized hospitals, licensed non-physician dialysis service providers and non-profit


-----

providers already licensed to provide services to SHI patients. As investors do not qualify as one of
the aforementioned eligible shareholders of MVZ, they are only able to indirectly establish and operate
an MVZ (e.g., by acting through non-physician dialysis healthcare service providers or through an
authorized or contract hospital), which, in turn, are not limited by similar ownership restrictions. Since
May 2019, providers of non-physician dialysis services are only allowed to set up an MVZ operating
in the same area of medical specialization. However, MVZs established by non-physician dialysis
service providers existing and authorized before May 11, 2019 benefit from grandfathering. Moreover,
since 2019, networks of physicians and municipalities are also authorized to establish an MVZ.

- Prior to 2012, any healthcare service provider licensed to provide services to SHI patients was entitled
to establish an MVZ entity. For MVZs licensed prior to 2012 that have been established by a
healthcare service provider which was no longer eligible under the regulatory regime applicable after
the legislative changes of 2012, the grandfathering provision under section 95 paragraph 1a SGB V is
also applicable. Grandfathering protection ceases after six months if new shareholders participate in
the MVZ entity that would have not been permitted as shareholders prior to 2012 (section 95
paragraph 6 SGB V).

- Shareholders of an MVZ operating in the legal form of a GmbH must provide a directly enforceable
guarantee (selbstschuldnerische Bürgschaft) for potential claims of the SHI physicians' associations
(kassenärztliche Vereinigungen) and SHI funds against the MVZ entity relating to the MVZ's
operation as a SHI healthcare provider. The obligations of the guarantor are strictly accessory to the
obligations of the MVZ as principal debtor and are not subject to priority claims by the beneficiaries
of these guarantees.

We believe that all German MVZs we own have obtained the relevant admissions.

Since 2019, various demands, including legislative proposals, requesting the enactment of stricter
regulations targeting investor owned MVZs have shaped the public debate. The out-patient market is
traditionally dominated by private practitioners and it is argued by certain political and healthcare
stakeholders in Germany that the healthcare system should be better protected against financial investors
which are allegedly primarily interested in financial results and not so much in the best and cost-efficient
treatment of out-patients.

The most recent discussions led to a resolution which was published on June 16, 2023, by the German
Federal Council (Bundesrat) and which deals with the proposed creation of a MVZ regulation. The key
elements of the proposed new regulation restricting the ownership of MVZs by hospitals are as follows:

- Restriction of the founding status of hospitals: MVZs may only be founded by a hospital in those
planning areas related to groups of physicians that are wholly or partially within a 50 km radius of the
sponsoring hospital. The regulation should provide for exceptions for underserved areas.

- Avoidance of monopolies: The supply share for all MVZs founded and held by a given hospital is to
be limited as follows: in the respective planning area for a specific group of physicians, 25% for
general practitioners and 50% for specialists; in the entire KV district, 5% for general practitioners
and 10% for specialists. The regulation is intended to provide exceptions for underserved areas. In
effect, this would mean a cap on the total proportion of SHI-accredited physician seats available for a
hospital-based MVZ structure in a given area.

The resolution of the Federal Council represents the most recent of various political signals without,
however, having any direct influence on a legislative process, as resolutions of the Federal Council are not
legally binding. It is expected that the proposed draft regulation, which has been announced by the Federal
Ministry of Health since the beginning of 2023 will be published in the course of the first quarter 2024. It
is not clear and not predictable whether the legislative proposals will be close to the considerations of the
Federal Council as the Ministry of Health is refusing any comment on the envisaged content of the proposed
new legislation.

Coincidentally with a potential reform of MVZ regulation, the German hospital system is under scrutiny in
terms of over-capacity and the need for consolidation. It is expected that such consolidation would lead to
a decrease of the number of hospital beds and to the shut-down of contract hospitals (that might also affect
hospitals which are currently operating MVZs). This will most probably affect small hospitals with a low
number of beds as they usually are considered inefficient. The corresponding political discussions are at an


-----

early stage, and thus the outcome of, and in particular the combined effect of, both legislative initiatives
cannot be foreseen.

The admission of outpatient medical service providers for SHI services is generally, depending on the
respective medical field, subject to capacity planning (Bedarfsplanung) on a state-by-state basis, which
means that admission is restricted in certain areas of medical specialization. Under this scheme, which was
subject to significant amendments in 2013, SHI admission in restricted areas, whether through individual
practice or as an employee in an MVZ, is only granted if the applicant already holds a planned position
(Kassenarztsitz, or Arztstelle in a MVZ) in that state or takes over the practice of physician who holds an
existing planned position. The replacement of a planned position generally requires a formal public
procurement proceeding prior to the transfer of a planned position to another physician. For an MVZ,
additional rules apply. An MVZ may generally be allowed to replace an employed doctor who leaves the
MVZ. When a physician in individual practice abandons his or her planned position to work in an MVZ,
according to current applicable laws, the licensing committee has to consent to such employment. The
anticipated reform of MVZ regulation might potentially affect the underlying statutory provision. While
previously exempted, laboratory specialists also became subject to capacity planning in 2013.

In the outpatient sector, different price and compensation levels exist under the SHI and PHI systems. In
the SHI system, a uniform assessment standard _Einheitlicher Bewertungsmaßstab, ("EBM") for_
compensation of medical services has been established at the federal level. The EBM is mandatory in the
SHI scheme and the fees for laboratory services are laid down in chapter 32. Payments are distributed and
effected at the state level by state associations of SHI physicians (kassenärztliche Vereinigungen). The
distribution system has undergone some changes during the last years. In the second half of 2012, the
German Federal Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (Kassenärztliche
_Bundesvereinigung, or national KV) implemented a central federal quota (i.e., a capped percentage of the_
scheduled EBM fees) for laboratory tests. Contrary to the former system, whereby quotas on scheduled
compensations were managed at the regional level, under the new national EBM funding structure quotas
were calculated nationwide and in advance for each quarter with the general objective of limiting the recent
significant increase in laboratory testing expenses in Germany. The quota for the fourth quarter of 2012
was 95.4%. It decreased for the first quarter of 2013 to 89.2%. The quota in 2015 was 91.58% and it
remained unchanged for 2016. The quota system has been modified again by a new laboratory reform act
which entered into force in April 2018. Under the new law, quota will be calculated again at a regional
level by the regional state associations of SHI physicians. However, such regional quota shall not underrun
a minimum quota of 89%. The same applies to the modified calculation of the bonus for cost-efficient
treatments which shall equally not fall below 89%. However, future tariff reductions cannot be excluded.

There has already been a decision by the Federal Social Court (Bundessozialgericht) that confirmed the
permissibility of introducing quotas into the reimbursement system for laboratory services.

In the PHI system, a binding scale of fees for physicians (Gebührenordnung für Ärzte, "GOÄ") has been
enacted by the Federal Ministry of Health. While it cannot be excluded that a GOÄ reform would be agreed
upon in the current legislative period (i.e., before 2025), it should be noted that such reform would require
years of implementation following approval.

Special contracts (Selektivverträge) between SHI funds and clinical laboratories are permitted in the
German clinical laboratory services market, and lower prices may be agreed in exchange for volume
guarantees. Prices for services provided to hospitals by clinical laboratory services operators under
outsourcing or other cooperation contracts are subject to negotiation or public procurement and are not
directly regulated.

A recurring element of the political debate is the introduction of a citizens' insurance scheme
(Bürgerversicherung), which would abolish the distinction between private and statutory health insurances
and could therefore also lead to considerable changes in the compensation of medical services. However,
this appears rather unlikely in the short and medium term.

**_Environmental Testing and Analysis_**

Environmental testing orders are placed following a procurement procedure or following a direct order of
private customers. Our service providers are licensed to the extent applicable, and, except for the location
in Freiburg, all locations are also accredited according to DIN EN ISO 17025.


-----

The locations are qualified by a number of diverse European, federal and state authorizations and
notifications, depending on the operations carried out at the respective laboratory. For example, under
section 15 paragraph 4 s.2 of the Drinking Water Ordinance (Trinkwasserverordnung), certain
examinations may be conducted by approved bodies. Certain of our locations are acknowledged as
investigative bodies for waste industry under the law of the states as applicable as well as investigative
bodies pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Soil Protection Act (Bundesbodenschutzgesetz). In addition,
certain of our locations hold permits for testing and analyzing sewage for the self-control of wastewater
facilities and the wastewater discharge required under the law of Saxony.

**_Diagnostics_**

Pursuant to section 44 of the German Infection Protection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz), _inter alia, the_
treatment of pathogenic agents requires permission by the competent authority, which may be denied if the
applicant does not have sufficient expert knowledge or is found to be unreliable. The same is true for the
treatment of epizootic pathogens under the Regulation on Epizootic Pathogens (Tierseuchenerreger_Verordnung)._

Except for the site in Leverkusen, the permissions under the Regulation on Epizootic Pathogens
(Tierseuchenerreger-Verordnung) have been granted to the full extent. The permission for the Leverkusen
site is expected to be granted soon.

**Italy**

The Italian healthcare system has been reformed taking into account the need of ensuring cost efficiency in
relation to enhancement of qualitative level of healthcare services, while also considering the peculiarity of
the regions involved. The most important regulation is that set forth in Legislative Decree December 30,
1992, no. 502, as subsequently modified, among others, by Legislative Decree December 7, 1993, no. 517
(the "Healthcare **Legislative Decree").**

The Italian healthcare system is decentralized and entails a strong involvement of regions.

In particular, the state is the one responsible for providing guidelines as to the functioning of the whole
systems, establishing the goals to be attained by regions. Such goals are reflected in the National Healthcare
Plan (Piano Sanitario Nazionale), which lays out, inter alia, the minimal and uniform levels of healthcare
assistance to be granted to the population and updated every three years. The regions administer powers
entrusted by national and regional laws, implement the National Healthcare Plan by adopting or
implementing specific regional healthcare plans and providing regulations as to the delivery of health
services and establishing criteria for allocating healthcare budgets, taking into account the needs and
peculiarities of local territorial entities. As to these latter entities, provinces oversee enacting hygiene,
environmental and preventive measures on the relevant territory. Municipalities are mainly dedicated to
administrative functions.

Decisions in the public sector are enacted on both a national and regional basis level in conformity with the
Italian Constitution, (in Italian: competenza concorrente, shared competence, pursuant to Article 117 of the
Italian Constitution). National laws and regulations provide a general framework for healthcare policy and
regional healthcare budgets. They also set indicative prices for diagnostic services tests. Each region must
implement regional healthcare system in compliance with the national legal framework and is responsible
for its own annual healthcare budget and for allocating funds to regional health authorities. In turn, regional
health authorities allocate funds to both public healthcare facilities and the private facilities meeting the
requirements described below.

To operate in the public healthcare system and receive financings and reimbursements from public
authorities, both public and private healthcare facilities must, cumulatively: (i) obtain authorization for the
construction and operation from the competent local authority - municipality or province or region,
depending upon the region involved (under Article 8-ter of the Healthcare Legislative Decree), which is
issued if the facilities meet certain minimum requirements (structural, technological and organizational) set
out at regional and municipal level; (ii) obtain accreditation from the competent authority for each
healthcare facility (under Article 8-quater of the Healthcare Legislative Decree) which, depending on the
regional legislation, may be issued by either the region or the regional health authority if the healthcare
services meet certain specific quality standards, additional to those provided for the attainment of the
authorization under point (i) established by the regions; (iii) enter into agreements with the regional health


-----

authorities for the number and type of services that each facility can provide (under Article 8-quinquies of
the Healthcare Legislative Decree). Maintaining the agreements with the public authorities is likely to
become more difficult in the future since it could be requested that the health structure carry out a minimum
number of tests per year.

The Healthcare Legislative Decree also regulates the procedures to be complied with as to the authorization
requests, the accreditation, the execution of the agreement and the thresholds for the reimbursement for
healthcare. While the authorization is the measure by which private and public health facilities are granted
with the possibility of providing healthcare services in Italy, the accreditation acknowledged those facilities,
that have been previously authorized, as providers within and on behalf of the national or regional health
service, allowing them with the possibility to enter into agreements and have access to healthcare services
budget.

In certain regions, new accreditations are currently limited, therefore new providers currently cannot enter
into agreements with regional healthcare authorities and new facilities cannot be opened. Authorized private
operators can open new facilities and operate as non-accredited laboratories with the public healthcare
system. In certain regions, such as Lombardy, new requirements for the authorization and accreditation of
laboratories have been approved, providing a term for the operators to comply with and from March 1,
2023, the laboratories that request new authorizations must immediately meet all the minimum structural
and organizational requirements (DGR n. XI/7044/2022). Generally, such administrative authorization is
granted to private individuals or the company, duly represented, that own non-accredited laboratory. Any
change of ownership in a non-accredited laboratory must be notified to the region and requires the new
owner to obtain administrative authorization to operate (or the step-in into the authorization of the previous
holder). The same applies to accredited healthcare facilities.

Public and private healthcare facilities, including clinical laboratories, are generally subject to the following
requirements: (i) adequacy of personnel in respect of the activity; (ii) specific professional qualifications of
managers and certain other staff members (e.g., the chief medical officer (direttore sanitario) must be a
qualified doctor and a member of the relevant professional association of doctors); (iii) technical, structural
and operational conditions must be met; and (iv) providing that requirements are met, legal entities or
natural persons operating the facilities must receive authorization from the relevant regional health
authority. These requirements are set out at regional level based on the general framework provided at
national level under Presidential Decree D.P.R. of January 14, 1997.

Private clinical laboratory operators can self-certify that all requirements are met by filing a declaration of
commencement of activity (e.g., Certified declaration of commencement of activity (Segnalazione
_Certificata di Inizio Attivita)) with the local regional health authority, so as the regional health authority_
verifies the accuracy of the information provided in such declaration of commencement of activity. In
addition to that, as mentioned above, clinical laboratories that intend to operate in the public healthcare
system must obtain accreditation by enrolling in the register of accredited facilities and being entitled to
enter into agreements with the regional health authorities. Even though most of the regions do not restrict
or limit the ownership of laboratories, some of them (e.g., Campania, Latium, Abruzzo and Liguria) started
a reorganization of the private accredited laboratories based, inter alia, on the introduction of a minimum
test volume threshold (soglia minima di efficienza) to be performed by private accredited laboratories or by
an aggregated consortium of private accredited laboratories. A hub-and-spoke system is to be implemented
among public laboratories, to which accredited healthcare facilities can participate, depending on what set
forth by the relevant region. Additionally, the types and target numbers of tests per laboratory have been
defined. The reorganization of the private accredited laboratories is based, inter alia, on the introduction of
a minimum test volume threshold to be performed by private accredited laboratories or by aggregations of
private accredited laboratories.

The national healthcare system ensures the provision of health services included in the "Essential Levels of
Care" (Livelli Essenziali di Assistenza) through the activity of public providers and accredited private
providers, with whom the regions enter into agreements for the reimbursement. All the providers under the
national healthcare system are paid according to prices established at the regional level, within the
framework of the reference legislation set at the national level to ensure the homogeneity of the system.
Accordingly, different prices are applied by the various regions. Regional health authorities are also in
charge of reimbursing healthcare facilities and are bound by the regulatory framework implemented by
their region. Moreover, with respect to patients covered by private insurance, prices are set by an agreement
between private insurance companies and healthcare facilities. The Italian Ministry of Health has issued a
new Decree of 23 June 2023, which has revised the tariffs, among others, for laboratory services.


-----

Health services advertising has been liberalized through Law Decree No. 223/2006 with respect to the
operations of sole practitioners, professional associations of doctors and medical service providers
established in the form of companies (including healthcare facilities, such as clinical laboratories).
Advertising in medical services must comply with certain provisions of law, with deontological regulations
and with the guidelines issued by medical professional associations. In addition to that, covert and deceptive
advertising is always forbidden.

Laboratories are also subject to specific environmental and hazardous waste management regulations (inter
_alia_ Presidential Decree no. 254/2003 providing rules on medical waste and Legislative Decree no.
152/2006 the "Italian Environmental Code"). Failure to comply with such regulatory framework may
result in administrative and criminal liability, including monetary fines, full or partial suspension of the
operation, obligation to compensate damages and clean up obligations.

Italian laws and regulations provide specifically for data protection requirements in connection with genetic
testing, including requirements for security measures (e.g., certified e-mails and coding, biometric tools
compliant with the applicable regulation), detailed information about the scope and purposes of the genetic
tests, and genetic counseling and wherever possible genetic data shall go through encryption and
pseudonymization procedures. Furthermore, for the safekeeping and security of genetic data, a dedicated
procedure for identifying access to the premises of persons authorized to process personal data must be
adopted and a person responsible to monitor access should be appointed. In addition to that, private and
public healthcare facilities must comply with the general data protection regulation.

Public healthcare structures and contracting entities are generally required to launch public tender
procedures to enter into contracts with third parties for works, services and supplies (as provided under
Legislative Decree no. 50/2016 and, currently, by the Legislative Decree no. 36/2023 effective from 1 July
2023 "Italian Code on Public Procurement"). Case-law has stated that the Italian Code on Public
Procurement does not apply to private accredited structures (Counsil of State, sez. III, 19 March 2018, n.
1739).

Italian Law Decree No. 21/2012 (as converted into law by Law no. 56/2012, and as subsequently amended
and implemented through specific Law Decrees, Presidential Decrees and Decrees of the President of the
Council of Ministers, the "Golden Power Law") grants to the Italian Government the power (the "Golden
**Power") for the purposes of safeguarding ownership structures of companies operating in sensitive and**
strategic industries ("Strategic Assets").

The Golden Power Law provides for the obligation to notify the Italian Government several transactions
involving Strategic Assets and, in particular:

(1) as far as the defense and national security sector (i.e., those activities/industries under the Decree of
the President of the Council of Ministers No. 108 of 6 June 2014) is concerned (Article 1, paragraph 1
of the Golden Power Law):

(a) corporate resolutions, acts or transactions of the shareholders' meeting or the management bodies
which have the effect of changing the ownership, control or availability of such Strategic Assets
(including those concerning the merger or demerger of the company, the transfer of the business
or of branches thereof or of controlled companies, the transfer abroad of the registered office, the
change of the corporate purpose, the dissolution of the company, the amendment of statutory
clauses possibly adopted pursuant to Article 2351, paragraph 3, of the civil code or introduced
pursuant to Article 3, paragraph 1, of the decree-law of 31 May 1994, n. 332, converted, with
amendments, by the law of 30 July 1994, n. 474.), the transfers of real or usage rights relating to
tangible or intangible assets, the assignment of the same as security or the assumption of
constraints that affect their use, also by reason of the subjection of the enterprise to bankruptcy
proceedings;

(b) irrespective of the nationality of the investor (it does not apply only in case of acquisitions made
by the Italian State or by an Italian State-controlled entity) any investment resulting in the
acquisition of any shareholding higher than 3% and, subsequently, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and
50% in the company holding the relevant Strategic Asset.

(2) As far as the telecommunications sector (i.e., those activities/industries under the Decree of the
President of the Council of Ministers No. 180 of 18 December 2020) and the sectors under Article 4,


-----

paragraph 1, of EU Regulation 2019/452 (as better detailed under Article 2, paragraph 1-ter of the
Golden Power Law and under the Decree of the President of the Council of Ministers No. 179 of 23
December 2020. These sectors include the healthcare, financial, data protection, biotechnologies,
artificial intelligence, semiconductor, etc.) are concerned (Article 2, paragraphs 2, 2-bis and 5):

(a) For the telecommunications sector, any resolution, act or operation, adopted by a company that
holds one or more of such Strategic assets, that has the effect of changing the ownership, control
or availability of the same assets or their destination, including the resolutions of the shareholders'
meeting or the administrative bodies concerning the merger or demerger of the company, the
transfer of the registered office abroad, the change of the corporate purpose, the dissolution of the
company, the amendment of statutory clauses or bylaws (possibly adopted pursuant to Article
2351, paragraph 3, of the civil code or introduced pursuant to Article 3, paragraph 1, of the decreelaw of 31 May 1994, n. 332, converted, with amendments, by the law of 30 July 1994, n. 474.) the
transfer of the business or of branches of it in which said assets are included or the assignment of
the same as a security;

(b) For the sectors under Article 4, paragraph 1, of EU Regulation 2019/452: (i) any resolution, act or
operation, adopted by an enterprise that holds one or more of such Strategic Assets that has the
effect of modifying the ownership, control or availability of the same assets in favor of a subject
external to the European Union, or, (ii) in the sectors of communications, energy, transport, health,
agro-food and finance, including credit and insurance, also in favor of a subject belonging to the
European Union, including those established or resident in Italy (including the resolutions of the
shareholders' meeting or of the administrative bodies having as their object the merger or demerger
of the company, the transfer of the business or of branches of it in which said assets are included
or the assignment of the same as a security, the transfer of controlled companies that hold the
aforementioned assets, or that has the effect of transferring the registered office to a country not
belonging to the European Union); as well as (iii) any resolution, act or operation, adopted by an
enterprise that holds one or more of such Strategic Assets, that has the effect of changing their
destination; and (iv) any resolution that has as its object the modification of the corporate purpose,
the dissolution of the company or the modification of statutory clauses and bylaws.

(c) For both sectors: (i) any acquisition of shares, by foreign entities not belonging to the European
Union, in companies that hold such Strategic Assets, that grant a share of voting rights or capital
at least equal to 10%, taking into account the shares or quotas already directly or indirectly owned,
when the total value of the investment is equal to or higher than €1.0 million; as well as (ii) the
acquisitions that determine the exceeding of the thresholds of 15%, 20%, 25% and 50% of the
capital; and, in any case, (iii) those acquisitions of such relevance as to determine the permanent
establishment of the buyer by reason of the assumption of control of the target company;

(d) For the sectors of communications, energy, transport, health, agro-food and finance, including
credit and insurance: any acquisition of shareholdings by subjects belonging to the European
Union, including those resident in Italy, of such relevance as to determine the permanent
establishment of the buyer by reason of the assumption of control of the target company.

(3) As far as the 5G sector is concerned, companies active in the telecommunication sector must notify
annually the Presidency of the Council of Ministers of a "purchase plan," (i.e., a plan describing all the
purchases in 5G technologies that the relevant company is planning to conclude during the year).

Corporate resolutions (paragraphs (1)(a); (2)(a); and (2)(b) above) must be notified within ten business days
from their adoption and, in any event, prior to their implementation.

Acquisitions (paragraphs (1)(b); (2)(c); and (2)(d)) must be notified within ten calendar days from closing
(in practice the notification is usually carried out between signing and closing, in order to obtain clearance
before the transaction is completed). The participation as a notifying party of the target company
recommended in all the sectors. Should the target company not be a notifying party, the same company
must be notified of the transaction together with the Government. Then, such company would have 15 days
to possibly file briefs and observations.

A "subject external to the European Union," as referenced in paragraph (2)(b) above, means (a) any natural
person who does not have the citizenship of a member state of the European Union; (b) any natural person


-----

who has the citizenship of a member state of the European Union and who does not have the residence, the
habitual abode or the main center of activity in a member state of the European Union or of the European
Economic Area or who is not otherwise established therein; (c) any legal person who does not have the
registered office or the administration or the main center of activity in a member state of the European
Union or of the European Economic Area or who is not otherwise established therein; (d) any legal person
who has established the registered office or the administration or the main center of activity in a member
state of the European Union or of the European Economic Area, or who is otherwise established therein,
and who is controlled, directly or indirectly, by a natural person or by a legal person referred to in letters
(a), (b) and (c); (e) any natural person or legal person who has the citizenship of a member state of the
European Union or of the European Economic Area who has established the residence, the habitual abode,
the registered office or the administration or the main center of activity in a member state of the European
Union, or who is otherwise established therein, where there are elements that indicate an evasive behavior
with respect to the application of the rules set out Golden Power Law.

Upon receipt of the filing, a 45-day waiting period (which can be extended twice and for an aggregate
period of up to 30 days, if additional information is deemed necessary by the Italian government on top of
that already provided, the "Waiting Period") begins, during which the Italian Government analyses the
relevant resolution or transaction and resolves as to whether to exercise or not the relevant Golden Power.
In case the cooperation mechanism provided for under EU Regulation 2019/452 is triggered, the Waiting
Period can be extended up to 115 calendar days in aggregate. If the Italian Government does not provide
clearance or exercise its Golden Power before the expiry of the Waiting Period, the resolution or transaction
is deemed to be cleared through the so called silent-consent mechanism, although this happens very rarely.
Until the Italian Government completes its review (or until the application is filed): (a) the relevant
corporate resolution cannot be implemented, and (b) the voting rights attached to the acquired shares are
suspended.

In case of non-compliance with the decision issued by the Italian Government or with the duty to file, (i) the
relevant resolution is null and void, (ii) the relevant acquisition can be vetoed or made subject to conditions
also post-closing, and (iii) the perpetrators can be subject to administrative fines up to two times the deal
value and not less than 1% of the aggregate turnover (as per the last financial statements) of the involved
entities.

Should specific reasons of national security/national interests be assessed, the Italian Government has the
power to: (i) veto corporate resolutions concerning companies holding Strategic Assets and resulting in a
change of ownership, control (in the defense sector, potentially also in favor of an Italian entity) or purpose
of such Strategic Assets, as well as transactions entailing the acquisition of relevant participations by nonEU entities (or in the communications, energy, transport, health, agro-food or finance (including credit and
insurance) sectors, in case of acquisition of control by a EU entity) over a company owning Strategic Assets,
and (ii) impose conditions (and subsequently monitor compliance with such conditions) on any of the above
corporate resolutions and transactions, in relation to the security of supplies and information, the transfer
of technologies, and export controls.

The Golden Power can be exercised only if the relevant resolutions or transactions could result in a serious
threat to the safety of the relevant Strategic Assets or to the essential interests of defense and national
security, safety and operation of strategic networks and installations, continuity of supplies, and safety and
public order. In particular, the veto power can be exercised only if the threat cannot be addressed by
imposing conditions on the relevant resolution or transaction.

The procedure above is slightly different for the 5G sector (point 3) above). In this case, the filing of the
"purchase plan" must be made annually and the Waiting Period amounts to 30 days, that can be extended
up to 40 days. The cooperation mechanism under EU Regulation 2019/452 does not apply.

Finally, Law Decree No. 21 of 22 March 2022, together with the Decree of the President of the Council of
Ministers No. 189 of 1 September 2022 have recently introduced the "pre-notification" procedure. When
there is uncertainty as to whether a transaction may fall within the scope of the Golden Power Law, this
pre-notification procedure is available, by way of which any interested company can submit to the
Presidency of the Council of Ministers a so-called "project" of the transaction and hear back within 30 days.
Within such timeframe, the Government must clarify if the transaction falls or not within the scope of
application of the Golden Power Law. The Government may also decide that while the transaction falls
within the scope of application of the Golden Power Law, no filing will be due. Should no response be
issued within the 30 days, filing will be due.

**United Kingdom**

In the United Kingdom, there is no specific regulation related to the ownership of a company operating
clinical laboratories.

Authorization to operate a clinical laboratory may, however, be suspended if the person responsible for
managing the clinical laboratory's provision of services to the NHS on a day to day basis (the clinical
laboratory's "registered manager"), fails the "fit and proper persons test." Since the implementation of a
particular measure in April 2015, the Care Quality Commission has been able to apply findings of failure
of the test more firmly against registered managers.

Further, in the event the clinical laboratory holds a contract with the NHS, it must hold a valid NHS Provider
License. A requirement before an NHS Provider License is issued is for the corporate directors and the
directors of any parent companies to make a declaration to satisfy a "fit and proper person test." This is a
separate requirement to that mentioned in the aforementioned paragraph (above).

In order to run a clinical laboratory in the United Kingdom, several authorizations and accreditations are
required. First, the company must register with the Care Quality Commission under the Health & Social
Care Act 2008 as a service provider; it must also register the address of every one of its laboratories. If the
company is already registered, it must apply to register any additional laboratories. Every laboratory must
also have a registered manager who supervises operations, quality, safety and compliance rules.

While clinical laboratories are not legally required to hold a UKAS accreditation, it is widely acknowledged
that holding this accreditation provides assurance to the marketplace and regulators that the laboratories
have met the relevant ISO standards and are periodically monitored for compliance. UKAS accreditation
is a contractual requirement to work with the NHS.

Lastly, according to the type of operation involved, certain specific authorizations may be required. For
example, an authorization from the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is necessary
for blood transfusions.

Biomedical scientists must be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC). There is
no legal requirement for a minimum number of biomedical scientists in a laboratory, however, the Institute
of Biomedical Science (IBMS) provides guidance on staffing and workload for clinical diagnostic
laboratory services.

The adoption of the Health & Social Care Act 2012 started an overhaul of the organization of the NHS and
the way in which budgets are allocated. This supports and facilitates agreements between the NHS and the
private sector.

-----

**_Agreed Security Principles_**

The Agreed Security Principles (the "Agreed Security Principles") apply to the granting of the Note
Guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Notes and are substantially similar to the agreed
security principles included in the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement. The Agreed Security Principles
include restrictions on the granting of Note Guarantees and security where, among other things, such grant
would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules,
corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, "thin capitalization" rules, capital maintenance rules,
retention of title claims and similar matters, where the time and cost of granting the guarantee or security
would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the holders or where security would be granted over
the capital stock, property or other assets, or liabilities of a member of the Group.

In this "Agreed Security Principles" section only, any reference to "Security," "Finance Documents,"
"Security Agent," "Transaction Security Document," "Finance Parties," "Obligor," "Declared Default,"
"Declared RCF Default," "Acquired Person or Asset," "Acquired Indebtedness," "Permitted Indebtedness,"
"Permitted Liens," "Facilities," "Lender," "Material Subsidiaries," "Guarantor Jurisdiction" and "Arranger"
is a reference to that term as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement and the 2023 Senior Facilities
Agreement as in effect on the Issue Date.

_General Principles_

The Agreed Security Principles embody the recognition by all parties that there may be certain legal and
practical difficulties in obtaining effective or commercially reasonable guarantees and/or Security from
relevant members of the Group in each jurisdiction in which it has been agreed that the Note Guarantees
and Security will be granted. In particular:

(1) general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and
other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, capital maintenance rules, fraudulent
preference, equitable subordination, "transfer pricing," "thin capitalization," "earnings stripping,"
"controlled foreign corporation" and other tax restrictions, "exchange control restrictions,"
"capital maintenance" rules and "liquidity impairment" rules, tax restrictions, retention of title
claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the
ability of a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or Security or may require that the
guarantee or Security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the guarantee or Security
will be limited accordingly, provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before
signing any applicable Security or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall
use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on
relationships with third parties and subject to fiduciary duties of management (a guarantee or
Security interest will not be required if giving such guarantee or taking such Security would expose
the directors of the relevant Issuer to a material risk of personal liability)) to overcome any such
obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or Transaction Security Document shall be subject to such
limit;

(2) certain general meeting, supervisory board, works council or another external body's or person's
consent may be required to enable a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or Security. Such
guarantee and/or Security shall not be required unless such consent has been received, provided
_that reasonable endeavors have been used by the relevant member of the Group to obtain the_
relevant consent (in each case if the Agent, taking into account the Issuer's view on any potential
impact on relationships with third parties, reasonably requests the Issuer to do so);

(3) a key factor in determining whether or not (and the terms on which) a guarantee or Security shall
be taken (and in respect of the Security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the
applicable time and cost (including, but not limited to, adverse effects on taxes, interest
deductibility, stamp duty, registration costs and taxes, notarial costs, translation costs and all
applicable legal and registration fees and adverse effects on the ability of the Group to obtain or
maintain local facilities or other financing arrangements, including any factoring or similar
arrangement in each case permitted under the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement) which shall not
be disproportionate to the benefit to the Finance Parties of obtaining such guarantee or Security;

(4) the maximum guaranteed or secured amount may be subject to limitations to minimize stamp duty,
notarization, registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties where the benefit of the


-----

guaranteed or secured amount is disproportionate to the level of such stamp duty, notarization,
registration or other applicable fee, taxes and duties (and in any event the maximum aggregate
amount payable by the Group in respect of fees, costs, expenses, disbursements and VAT relating
to the provision of Note Guarantees and Security shall be limited to an amount to be agreed
between the Security Agent and the Issuer);

(5) it is acknowledged that in certain jurisdictions it may be either impossible or impracticable to
create Security over certain categories of assets, in which event Security will not be taken over
such assets;

(6) members of the Group will not be required to give Note Guarantees or enter into Transaction
Security Documents if they are not wholly owned by members of the Group and such subsidiaries
will not be required to provide Note Guarantees or Security, in either case, if the relevant minority
shareholders have not provided their prior consent to such Security or Note Guarantees being
granted where such consent is required provided that reasonable endeavors to obtain such consent
shall be used by the Group if (i) the relevant entity is not subject to any statutory requirement as
to the composition of its shareholders, and (ii) the relevant asset is material and the Issuer
determines that such endeavors will not have a negative impact on commercial relationships with
third parties;

(7) members of the Group will not be required to give Note Guarantees or enter into Transaction
Security Documents if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or
if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any
applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result
in a material risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of any director of or any member of
the Group _provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any_
applicable Transaction Security Document or accession document, the relevant member of the
Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse
impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such
guarantee or Transaction Security Document shall be subject to such limit;

(8) Note Guarantees and Security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all
registration and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of Security will not exceed an
amount to be agreed between the Issuer and the Security Agent;

(9) where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting
Security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such Security, Security
will be granted over the material assets only;

(10) any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, license, instrument, regulatory constraint
(including any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third party
arrangement (other than restrictions contained in the constitutional documents of a member of the
Group or in any intra-Group loan agreement), which may prevent or condition the asset from being
charged, secured or being subject to the applicable Transaction Security Document (including
requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any
asset which, if subject to the applicable Transaction Security Document, would give a third party
the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to
any member of the Group in respect of the asset or require the relevant chargor to take any action
materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof, in each case will be
excluded from a guarantee or Transaction Security Document;

(11) the giving of a guarantee, the granting of Security and the registration and/or the perfection of the
Security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the
relevant Obligor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise
permitted by the Finance Documents (including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual
counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits of
obligations, in each case prior to a Declared Default or a Declared RCF Default which is
continuing), and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any
person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to this paragraph (11);


-----

(12) no guarantee or Security will be required to be given by or over any Acquired Person or Asset
(and no consent shall be required to be sought with respect thereto) which are required to support
Acquired Indebtedness to the extent such Acquired Indebtedness is permitted by the 2023 Senior
Facilities Agreement to remain outstanding after an acquisition. No member of a target group or
other entity acquired pursuant to an acquisition permitted by the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement
shall be required to become a Guarantor or grant Security with respect to the Facilities if prevented
by the terms of the documentation governing that acquired indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness) or if becoming a Guarantor or the granting of any Security would give rise to an
obligation (including any payment obligation) under or in relation thereto; no Security will be
granted over any asset secured for the benefit of any Permitted Indebtedness and/or to the extent
constituting a Permitted Lien unless specifically required by a Finance Document to the contrary;

(13) to the extent possible and legally effective, all Security shall be given in favor of the Security
Agent and not the Finance Parties individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of
Transaction Security Documents for all the Finance Parties); "Parallel Debt" provisions will be
used where necessary and such provisions will be contained in the Intercreditor Agreement and
not the individual Transaction Security Documents, unless agreed by the Issuer and the Security
Agent as being required to avoid an amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement; no member of the
Group will be required to take any action in relation to any guarantees or Security as a result of
any assignment or transfer by a Lender;

(14) to the extent possible and unless required by applicable law, there should be no action required to
be taken in relation to the Note Guarantees or Security when any Lender assigns or transfers any
of its participation to a new Lender (and, unless explicitly agreed to the contrary in the 2023 Senior
Facilities Agreement, no member of the Group shall bear or otherwise be liable for any taxes
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, stamp duty (Rechtsgeschäftsgebühr) under Austrian law),
any notarial, registration or perfection fees or any other costs, fees or expenses that result from
any assignment or transfer by a Finance Party);

(15) Security will, where possible and practicable, automatically create Security over future assets of
the same type as those already secured; where local law requires supplemental pledges, additional
information, such as lists of assets, or notices to be delivered in respect of future acquired assets
in order for effective Security to be created over that class of asset, such supplemental pledges,
lists of assets or notices will be provided only upon request of the Security Agent if a Declared
Default or a Declared RCF Default has occurred and is continuing and at intervals no more
frequent than annually;

(16) no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be
required;

(17) unless granted under a global Transaction Security Document governed by the law of the
jurisdiction of a Guarantor or under English law, all Security (other than share Security over an
Obligor Subsidiary) shall be governed by the law of, and shall secure only assets located in the
jurisdiction of incorporation of that Guarantor;

(18) the Note Guarantees and Security will not be required from or over, or over the assets of, any joint
venture or similar arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group (other than the
Issuer) that is not wholly-owned by another member of the Group;

(19) each Transaction Security Document shall be deemed not to restrict or condition any transaction
permitted under the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security granted under each Transaction Security Document shall be deemed to be subject to these
Agreed Security Principles, before and after the execution of the relevant Transaction Security
Document and creation of the relevant Security;

(20) no Security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing
provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement;

(21) except as provided in (15) above, no Security will be taken over receivables if it would require
periodic listing, filing, notification or specification of such receivables;


-----

(22) no Security will be required over any assets subject to Security in favor of a third party (other than
in relation to Security under general business conditions of account banks which do not prohibit
or prevent the creation of Security over such accounts) or any cash constituting regulatory capital
or customer cash (and such assets shall be excluded from any relevant Transaction Security
Document);

(23) no translation of any document relating to any Security or any asset subject to any Security will
be required to be prepared or provided to the Finance Parties, unless (i) required for such
documents to become effective and admissible in evidence and (ii) a Declared Default or a
Declared RCF Default has occurred and is continuing; and

(24) no Security will be required to be granted over any class of assets other than (i) shares in any
Material Subsidiary, (ii) material bank accounts of the Issuer (without control or notification prior
to the occurrence of a Declared Default or a Declared RCF Default which is continuing) and
(iii) receivables owing to Obligors (being loans downstreaming the proceeds of the Facilities or
the equity contribution into the Group on or around the Completion Date); and

(25) prior to the Control Date, no member of the Target Group shall be required to guarantee or secure
any Commitments, Utilizations, Ancillary Commitments or Ancillary Outstandings, other than
any Commitments utilized by any member of the Target Group.

_Governing Law and Scope_

The Note Guarantees and Security to be provided in respect of the Facilities in accordance with the Agreed
Security Principles are only to be given by Material Subsidiaries which are incorporated in the Guarantor
Jurisdictions. No Security or Note Guarantees shall be required to be given by (or over the shares or
investments in) (i) any entity not incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction or (ii) any joint venture or similar
arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group that is not wholly owned by another
member of the Group.

All security (other than share security) will be governed by the law of, and secure only assets located in,
the jurisdiction of incorporation of the applicable grantor of the security and no action in relation to security
(including any perfection step, further assurance step, filing or registration) will be required in jurisdictions
where the grantor of the security is not incorporated. Share security over any subsidiary will be governed
by the law of the place of incorporation of that subsidiary. Any security over a structural intercompany loan
will be, at the option of the Issuer, governed by the governing law of such structural intra-Group loan
document or English law.

_Terms of Transaction Security Documents_

The following principles will be reflected in the terms of any Transaction Security:

(1) Security will not be enforceable or crystallize unless and until a Declared Default or Declared RCF
Default has occurred and is continuing;

(2) notification of receivables Security to debtors and of Security over assets held by third parties will
only be given if a Declared Default or a Declared RCF Default has occurred and is continuing
(provided that, in the case of any Transaction Security Document entered into in respect of
receivables due from other members of the Group, each relevant member of the Group shall be
notified of the execution of that Transaction Security Document where required for the perfection
of Security);

(3) in respect of Security over intercompany receivables, unless a Declared Default or a Declared RCF
Default has occurred and is continuing, the pledgors shall, subject to the terms of the 2023 Senior
Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement, be free to deal with those receivables in the
course of its business;

(4) the Transaction Security Documents should only operate to create Security rather than to impose
new commercial obligations or repeat clauses in other Finance Documents; accordingly:

(a) they should not contain any additional (or repeat or extend any existing) representations,
undertakings, indemnities or other terms (including in respect of title, insurance,


-----

information, maintenance or protection of assets, further assurance or the payment of fees,
costs and expenses) or provisions for default or penalty interest, tax gross-up or any
indemnities or any equivalent representations or undertakings to those representations or
undertakings in the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement unless these are provisions required
for the creation or perfection of the Security under applicable law and are no more
onerous than the terms of the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement (or otherwise in
accordance with practice between lead counsel to the Group and lead counsel to the
Arrangers) and except in relation to any Transaction Security provided by the Security
provider to the extent the relevant provisions are incorporated by reference to the 2023
Senior Facilities Agreement; and

(b) nothing in any Transaction Security Document shall (or be construed to) prohibit any
transaction, matter or other step (or a grantor of security taking or entering into the same)
or dealing in any manner whatsoever in relation to any asset (including all rights, claims,
benefits, proceeds and documentation, and contractual counterparties in relation thereto)
the subject of (or expressed to be the subject of) the Transaction Security Document if
permitted by the terms of the other Finance Documents (and accordingly to such extent,
the Security Agent shall promptly effect releases, confirmations, consents to deal or
similar steps always at the cost of the relevant grantor of the Security);

(c) in no event shall control agreements (or perfection by control or similar arrangements)
be required with respect to any assets (including deposit or securities accounts);

(d) each Transaction Security Document must contain a clause which records that if there is
a conflict between the Transaction Security Document and the 2023 Senior Facilities
Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement then (to the fullest extent permitted by law)
the provisions of the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement or (as applicable) the Intercreditor
Agreement will take priority over the provisions of the Transaction Security Document
(and that, if requested to do so by (and at the cost of) the Issuer, the Security Agent will
enter into such amendments, waivers or consents as are necessary to remove such
conflict);

(e) in respect of the share pledges, unless a Declared Default or a Declared RCF Default has
occurred and is continuing (and, in relation to share pledges governed by German law, at
all times), the pledgors shall be permitted to retain and to exercise voting rights to any
shares pledged by them in a manner which (other than pursuant to a step or matter which
does not otherwise breach the terms of the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement) does not
adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the Security or cause an Event of Default
to occur, and the pledgors shall be permitted to receive and retain dividends on pledged
shares and pay dividends up-stream on pledged shares to the extent permitted under the
2023 Senior Facilities Agreement;

(f) the Finance Parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the
relevant time) will only be able to exercise any power of attorney granted to them under
the Transaction Security Documents if a Declared Default or a Declared RCF Default has
occurred and is continuing or after failure by the grantor of such Security to comply with
a further assurance or perfection obligation (and any grace period applicable thereto has
expired), but, in the case of a failure to comply with a further assurance or perfection
obligation, only to the extent necessary to comply with such further assurance or
perfection obligation;

(g) any rights of set-off will not be exercisable unless a Declared Default or a Declared RCF
Default has occurred and is continuing; and

(h) the Transaction Security Documents must (but in connection with German notarial
security, only to the extent legally possible) contain a clause substantially similar to the
following:

_Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but without prejudice to the_
_creation or perfection of any security interest under this Agreement, the terms of this_
_Agreement shall not operate or be construed so as to prohibit or restrict any transaction,_


-----

_matter or other step (or the [security grantor] taking or entering into the same or dealing_
_in any manner whatsoever in relation to any asset (including all rights, claims, benefits,_
_proceeds and documentation, and contractual counterparties in relation thereto))_
_permitted by the Debt Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (other than_
_this Agreement), and the Security Agent shall promptly enter into such documentation_
_and/or take such other action in relation to this Agreement as is required by the [security_
_grantor] (acting reasonably) in order to facilitate any such transaction, matter or other_
_step, including, but not limited to, by way of executing any confirmation, consent to_
_dealing, release or other similar or equivalent document, or returning any physical_
_collateral._

_Guarantees/Security_

Subject to applicable practical and/or legal limitations, each Note Guarantee will be an up-stream, crossstream and downstream guarantee and Security for all liabilities of the Obligors under the Finance
Documents in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of the Agreed Security Principles in each
relevant jurisdiction. Transaction Security Documents will secure the guarantee obligations of the relevant
Security provider or, if such Security is provided on a third party basis, all liabilities of the Obligors under
the Finance Documents, in each case in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of the Agreed
Security Principles in each relevant jurisdiction.

The Security Agent or the Finance Parties, as the case may be, shall at the cost and request of the Obligors
promptly discharge any guarantees and release any Security which is or are or has become subject to any
legal or regulatory prohibition as is referred to in the preceding paragraph.

To the extent that any member of the Group is required under these Agreed Security Principles to use
reasonable endeavors to obtain consent from any third party, if the member of the Group has used its
reasonable endeavors but has not been able to obtain such consent within 15 Business Days, such
requirement to use reasonable endeavors shall cease on the expiry of such 15 Business Day period.

Any Transaction Security Document shall only be required to be notarized or notarially certified if required
by law in order for the relevant Security to become effective or admissible in evidence or unless otherwise
agreed in writing by the Issuer.

_Bank Accounts_

If an Obligor grants security over its material current bank accounts it will be free to deal, operate and
transact business in relation to those accounts (including opening and closing accounts) until the occurrence
of a Declared Default or a Declared RCF Default which is continuing. For the avoidance of doubt, there
will be no "fixed" security over bank accounts, cash or receivables or any obligation to hold or pay cash or
receivables in a particular account until the occurrence of a Declared Default or a Declared RCF Default
which is continuing.

Any security over bank accounts will be subject to any security interests in favor of the account bank which
are created either by law or in the standard terms and conditions of the account bank. No member of the
Group will be required to change its banking arrangements or standard terms and conditions in connection
with the granting of bank account security.

_Shares_

Security over shares, stocks or partnership interests granted by an Obligor will be limited to those over a
wholly-owned Obligor incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction. For the avoidance of doubt, no Security
shall be required to be granted by, or over the shares in, entities which are not wholly-owned Obligors
incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction.

Until a Declared Default or a Declared RCF Default is continuing, the legal title of the shares will remain
with the relevant grantor of the Security (unless transfer of title on granting such Security is customary in
the applicable jurisdiction (as agreed between the legal counsel of the Group and the legal counsel of the
Agent in the relevant jurisdiction)) and any grantor of share Security will be permitted to retain and to
exercise voting rights and powers in relation to any shares and other related rights charged by it and receive,
own and retain all assets and proceeds in relation thereto without restriction or condition. With respect to


-----

any Issuer incorporated in Germany, the voting rights and powers in relation to the shares in such Issuer
will remain with the grantor of the security at all times.

Italian pledges over quotas in Italian limited liability companies (società a responsabilità limitata) or any
other Transaction Security Document governed by Italian law which require to be entered into in notarial
form, in each case securing third parties' obligations (i.e., obligations different from the relevant pledgor's
own obligations as borrower) shall be subject to a cap on the secured obligations to be agreed from time to
time with respect to the specific circumstances between the pledgor and the Security Agent.

Unless the restriction if required by law or the terms of a shareholders agreement, the constitutional
documents of the Issuer whose shares are to be pledged will be amended to the extent that it is within the
power of the pledgor to do so (without breaching obligations to third parties) to remove any restriction on
the pledging of such shares and on the transfer or the registration of the transfer of the shares on enforcement
of the Security granted over them.

Where customary and applicable as a matter of law, in the case of:

(1) any Transaction Security Document entered into pursuant to Part 1 (Conditions Precedent to
_Initial Utilisation) of Schedule 2 (Conditions Precedent) in the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement,_
as soon as reasonably practicable following the Issue Date (and taking into account any stamping
requirements in respect of any stock transfer form (or applicable law equivalent)); and

(2) in any other circumstance, following a request by the Security Agent following a Declared Default
or a Declared RCF Default which is continuing,

the applicable share certificate (or other documents evidencing title to the relevant shares) and a stock
transfer form executed in blank (or applicable law equivalent) will be provided to the Security Agent upon
its request.

_No other security_

Subject to these Agreed Security Principles, the Obligors will only grant the following security:

(1) Security over the shares in any wholly-owned Material Subsidiary;

(2) Security over any material structural intra-Group receivables owing to Obligors (being loans
down-streaming the proceeds of the Facilities or the equity contribution into the Group on or
around the Completion Date); and

(3) Security (without control or notification prior to the occurrence of a Declared Default or a Declared
RCF Default which is continuing) of the Issuer's material bank accounts.

Save as described in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) above, no other security will be granted.

**2023 Term Loan Facilities**

The 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement is also expected to provide for term loans in an aggregate principal
amount of up to, when taken together with the amount of the Notes, €1,450.0 million to be made available
to us (the "2023 Term Loan Facilities") in addition to the New Revolving Credit Facility (see "—New
_Revolving Credit Facility" above)._

**_Borrowings_**

Borrowings under the 2023 Term Loan Facilities are permitted to be used directly or indirectly in or towards
(including by way of on-lending to, or investment in, any other member of the group), refinancing the
interim facility B (if drawn) and otherwise applied in or towards:

(a) financing or refinancing consideration paid or payable in connection with the Acquisition
(including any further acquisition of any Target shares after the initial closing date);

(b) the payment of Acquisition costs and all other fees, costs, expenses and other amounts
incurred in connection with the transaction;


-----

(c) refinancing or otherwise discharging certain existing debt (including backstopping or
providing cash-cover in respect of any letters of credit, guarantees or ancillary, revolving,
working capital or local facilities or other arrangements) and paying any breakage costs,
redemption premium, make-whole costs and other fees, costs and expenses payable in
connection with such refinancing and/or acquisition;

(d) financing any other payments identified in the tax structure memorandum arising in
connection with any acquisition, together with related fees, costs and expenses;

(e) financing other related amounts, including fees, costs and expenses; and

(f) to the extent not applied for a purpose set out in sub-paragraphs (a) to (e) (inclusive)
above, financing or refinancing the general corporate purposes and/or working capital
requirements of the Group (including, for the avoidance of doubt, as cash overfunding).

**_Bullet repayment at maturity_**

The loans made under the 2023 Term Loan Facilities must be repaid in full on the date falling 84 months
after the date of first utilization of the 2023 Term Loan Facilities.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Any loans under the 2023 Term Loan Facilities will bear interest, paid semi-annually in arrear (or at shorter
intervals elected by us), at a rate per annum equal to EURIBOR (subject to a floor of zero) plus a margin
to be determined at or around the time of pricing the Notes. The margin may be reduced by reference to a
consolidated senior secured leverage test.

**Further Description of the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement**

The New Revolving Credit Facility and the 2023 Term Loan Facilities are subject to other provisions of
the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement as further described in this section.

**_Additional Facility_**

We may elect to request, subject to certain terms and conditions, the commitment of additional facilities,
either as a new facility or as additional sub tranches of existing facilities (the "Additional Facility
**Commitments"). We may agree with the relevant lenders certain terms in relation to the Additional Facility**
Commitments, including the termination date and the availability period. The margin on any cash advances
under the Additional Facility Commitments will be agreed between us and the relevant lenders providing
the relevant Additional Facility Commitments. There are no Additional Facility Commitments as of the
date of this Offering Memorandum.

**_Security and Guarantees_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility and the 2023 Term Loan Facilities will be guaranteed on a joint and
several basis by us and certain of our subsidiaries, of which certain may elect to incur indebtedness under
the 2023 Term Loan Facilities and/or the New Revolving Credit Facility should they accede to the 2023
Senior Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement in such a capacity.

The New Revolving Credit Facility and the 2023 Term Loan Facilities will be secured by security granted
by us and certain of our subsidiaries over shares, structural intercompany receivables and certain bank
accounts.

**_Covenants_**

The 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement requires us to observe certain customary incurrence covenants,
subject to certain exceptions, including covenants relating to making asset sales, the incurrence of
indebtedness, making restricted payments, granting liens, merging or consolidating with other entities and
conducting transactions with affiliates. There are also certain customary covenants, subject to certain
exceptions, including obtaining required authorizations; complying with laws and maintaining at least a
_pari passu ranking with certain unsecured and unsubordinated payment obligations._


-----

**_Springing Leverage Covenant_**

The 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement includes a springing financial covenant for the benefit of the lenders
under the New Revolving Credit Facility only. The covenant level is "flat," in that it does not anticipate
deleveraging.

The financial covenant is on an LTM basis on each quarter date, with the first testing date in respect of the
LTM period ending on the quarter date falling at the end of the third complete financial quarter following
the date of first utilization of the 2023 Term Loan Facilities. The financial covenant is only required to be
tested if, as of 5.00 p.m. (London time) on a test date, the base currency amount of the aggregate outstanding
amount of all loans under the New Revolving Credit Facility as at the last financial quarter (excluding any
loans used to fund any OID flex or other flex payments and expenses, any letters of credit or bank
guarantees, any Ancillary Facilities, any utilizations of the New Revolving Credit Facility made on prior to
the date of first utilization of the 2023 Term Loan Facilities (and any rollover loan in respect thereof) and
any utilizations under the New Revolving Credit Facility used to fund any permitted acquisitions, capital
expenditure or other investments), net of any cash or cash equivalent investments held by the group at such
time exceeds 40% of the aggregate of (i) the total commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility
as at the date of the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement and (ii) the aggregate of all commitments under the
New Revolving Credit Facility established after the date of the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement
(disregarding any reduction in such commitments following the establishment thereof).

Any failure to satisfy the springing financial covenant shall not (or shall not be deemed to) directly or
indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term or a
"default" or an "event of default" (each as defined therein) for any other facility unless the New Revolving
Credit Facility has been accelerated and an "acceleration event" (as defined therein) is continuing with
respect thereto.

We are permitted to prevent or cure breaches of the financial covenant by applying a "cure" amount
(generally, amounts received by us in cash pursuant to any new equity or permitted subordinated debt) as
if (at our option) (a) the consolidated leverage had been reduced by such amount or the consolidated
EBITDA has been increased by such amount (an "EBITDA Cure"), (b) senior secured indebtedness had
been decreased by such amount (a "Net Debt Cure") or (c) the New Revolving Credit Facility had been
prepaid by such amount such that, following such prepayment, the test condition was no longer met (a
"Prepayment Cure"). There is no requirement to apply any cure amount in prepayment of the facilities
under the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement, except when we elect to apply a Prepayment Cure. We are not
permitted to exercise EBITDA Cures more than five times in aggregate during the term of the 2023 Senior
Facilities Agreement or more than twice in any three consecutive periods of four consecutive financial
quarters (or 12 consecutive months (as relevant)). We are also permitted to prevent or cure breaches of the
financial covenant by electing to recalculate the test condition or the financial covenant as if (at our option)
the test condition would not be met, or the financial covenant would be complied with.

**_Prepayment_**

The 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement permits each lender to require the mandatory prepayment of all
amounts due to that lender upon the occurrence of a "change of control" (as defined therein). If the
consolidated senior secured leverage ratio is greater than 4.00:1, we are required to apply 50% of "excess
cash flow" (as defined therein) (stepping down to 0% of excess cash flow if the consolidated senior secured
leverage ratio is equal to or less than 4.00:1) in prepayment of the 2023 Term Loan Facilities, subject to a
basket of 25% of EBITDA (with 100% carry forward and carry back) plus restricted payments, debt
buybacks, voluntary prepayments, debt repayments, acquisitions, disposals, restructuring costs, group
initiatives, investments and capital expenditures in the relevant financial year.

We may also voluntarily prepay the whole or any part of a loan made under the 2023 Term Loan Facilities
by giving prior notice (without premium or penalty).

**_Events of Default_**

The 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement provides for certain events of default the occurrence of which would
allow the lenders to accelerate all outstanding loans and terminate their commitments and, in the case of
the New Revolving Credit Facility, terminate any letters of credit and ancillary facilities, or declare that


-----

cash cover in respect of any letters of credit and ancillary facilities is immediately due and payable, subject
in certain cases to agreed grace periods, thresholds and other qualifications.

The customary events of default include, subject to certain agreed exceptions, non-payment, breach of other
obligations set forth in the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement and related documentation, inaccuracy of a
material representation or statement when made, default of certain indebtedness, certain insolvency,
winding-up or related events and unlawfulness of any material obligations which could reasonably be
expected to materially adversely affect the interests of the finance parties under the finance documents.

**_Governing Law_**

The 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement is governed by English law.

**Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B Facility**

On December 10, 2020, SYNLAB Bondco PLC, a subsidiary of the Target, entered into an amendment and
restatement of its senior secured term loan facilities agreement originally dated June 22, 2019 (the "Existing
**SYNLAB Term Loan B Facility Agreement"). In the event that the number of shares held by the Bidder**
does not meet the Squeeze-Out Threshold, the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B is expected to be repaid in
part or in full using cash on the Target's statement of financial position, proceeds of the Offering and/or
borrowings under the New Term Loan B that are not required to be utilized for purposes of acquiring shares
of the Target that are not required to be utilized for purposes of acquiring shares of the Target. See "Use of
_Proceeds." Any such repayment will be facilitated by a shareholder loan from the Issuer to SYNLAB_
Bondco PLC on terms acceptable to the Target. In the event that the number of shares held by the Bidder
meets the Squeeze-Out Threshold, there is no requirement for the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B to be
refinanced in connection with the Transactions.

**_Borrowings_**

The Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B Facility Agreement includes a facility of €385.0 million (the
"Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B"), which has been borrowed by SYNLAB Bondco PLC as of the date
of this Offering Memorandum. On gaining control of the Target and its subsidiaries, the Issuer may (in its
discretion) offer to the lenders of the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B that their commitments be elevated
to rank _pari passu with the Notes (or that the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B will be replaced with_
Additional Facility Commitments (as defined above)).

**_Bullet Repayment at Maturity_**

The Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B must be repaid in full on July 1, 2027.

**_Interest and Fees_**

The Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B bears interest, paid semi-annually in arrear (or at shorter intervals
elected by us), at a rate per annum equal to EURIBOR (subject to a floor of zero) plus a margin of 3.75%
per annum. The margin may be reduced by reference to a consolidated senior secured leverage test.

**_Security and Guarantees_**

Prior to its amendment and restatement on December 10, 2020, the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B
Facility Agreement had the benefit of guarantees and security granted by (and over) certain subsidiaries of
SYNLAB Bondco PLC which were subject to a release condition upon the event of an initial public offering
under certain circumstances (the "IPO Release Condition"). Following the initial public offering of
SYNLAB AG, a parent entity of SYNLAB Bondco PLC, on April 21, 2021, the IPO Release Condition
was satisfied, and the guarantees and the security arrangements were released, such that, as at the date of
this Offering Memorandum, the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B Facility Agreement does not have the
benefit of any guarantees and is secured solely by a share charge granted over SYNLAB Bondco PLC.

**_Covenants_**

The Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B Facility Agreement requires SYNLAB Bondco PLC to observe
certain customary incurrence covenants, subject to certain exceptions, including covenants relating to
making asset sales, the incurrence of indebtedness, making restricted payments, granting liens, making


-----

dividends, merging or consolidating with other entities and conducting transactions with affiliates. There
are also certain customary covenants, subject to certain exceptions, including obtaining required
authorizations, complying with laws and maintaining at least a pari passu ranking with certain unsecured
and unsubordinated payment obligations.

**_Prepayment_**

The Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B Facility Agreement permits each lender to require the mandatory
prepayment of all amounts due to that lender upon the occurrence of a "change of control" (as defined
therein). SYNLAB Bondco PLC must apply 100% of any "excess proceeds" (as defined therein) in
prepayment of either the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B or other indebtedness, stepping down to 50% if
the consolidated senior secured leverage ratio is greater than 5.00:1.

SYNLAB Bondco PLC may also voluntarily prepay the whole or any part of the Existing SYNLAB Term
Loan B by giving prior notice (without premium or penalty).

**_Events of Default_**

The Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B Facility Agreement provides for certain events of default the
occurrence of which would allow the lenders to accelerate all outstanding loans and terminate their
commitments, subject in certain cases to agreed grace periods, thresholds and other qualifications.

The customary events of default include, subject to certain agreed exceptions, non-payment, breach of other
obligations set forth in the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B Facility Agreement and related documentation,
inaccuracy of a material representation or statement when made, default of certain indebtedness, certain
insolvency, winding-up or related events and unlawfulness of any material obligations which materially
and adversely affects the interests of the finance parties under the finance documents.

**_Governing Law_**

The Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B Facility Agreement is governed by English law.

**Existing Revolving Credit Facility**

SYNLAB AG is party to a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of €500.0 million (the
"Existing Revolving Credit Facility"), which will be repaid and cancelled in connection with the
Transactions.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**General**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the Issuer and
Ephios Subco 2 intend to enter into an intercreditor agreement (the "Intercreditor Agreement") with,
among others, the Security Agent, the agents, arrangers and lenders under the 2023 Senior Facilities
Agreement and the Trustee.

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and
conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out various matters governing the
relationship of the creditors to our group including the relative ranking of certain debt of Ephios Subco 2,
the Issuer, the Guarantors and any other person that becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a
Debtor, when payments can be made in respect of debt of the Debtors, when enforcement action can be
taken in respect of that debt, the terms pursuant to which certain of that debt will be subordinated upon the
occurrence of certain insolvency events and turnover provisions and provisions related to the enforcement
of shared security.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions to be contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that
document because it, and not the discussion that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes


-----

and of the Trustee. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the
Intercreditor Agreement.

For the purposes of this description:

References to the "Senior Secured Notes" shall include the Notes, any additional notes issued from time
to time under the Indenture, and any other notes, securities or other debt instruments issued or to be issued
by, or in relation to which a New Debt Financing (as defined below) has been made available to or by, a
member of the Group which are designated by the Issuer as Senior Secured Notes under the Intercreditor
Agreement, and references to the "Topco Notes" shall include any notes, securities or other debt
instruments issued or to be issued by, or in relation to which a New Debt Financing has been made available
to or by, a Topco Borrower (as defined below) which are designated by the Issuer as Topco Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement uses the term "Senior Secured Notes Liabilities" to refer to the Senior
Secured Notes and certain other indebtedness of the Issuer.

**Ranking and Priority**

_Priority of Debts_

No Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a particular
relevant event of default more than 45 days after the occurrence of the relevant event of default. No more
than one Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect to the same event or set of
circumstances or (ii) in any period of 360 days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities as a result of the issue of a
Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default shall not prevent
(i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to
the relevant Second Lien Liabilities or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice in respect of an event of
default under the finance documents documenting any Second Lien Liabilities (a "Second Lien
**Enforcement Notice") on behalf of the Second Lien Creditors.**

**Payment Obligations and Capitalisation of Interest Continue**

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor or Third Party
Security Provider from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue
to accrue) under the applicable Debt Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted
at any time. The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt
Documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a payment stop notice.

**Cure of Payment Stop**

If:

(1) at any time following the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a
Senior Secured Payment Default that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding
and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and


-----

(2) the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Second Lien Creditors an amount equal to any
payments which had accrued under the Second Lien Finance Documents and which would have
been Permitted Second Lien Payments but for that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or Senior
Secured Payment Default (as the case may be),

then any event of default which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be
waived and any Second Lien Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that event of
default shall be waived without any further action being required by the Second Lien Creditors.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of Topco Liabilities_

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities (together, the "Secured Liabilities") have been discharged
(the "Priority Discharge Date"), the Debtors, the members of the Group, the Topco Borrowers and the
Third Party Security Providers may only make specified payments in respect of the Topco Liabilities, in
accordance with the finance documents governing such Topco Liabilities, subject to compliance with
certain conditions in the Intercreditor Agreement.

The principal conditions are that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalized interest)
is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreement, including any Permitted Super Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement, Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, any Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
any Second Lien Facility Agreement and any Second Lien Notes Indenture (or if it is so prohibited, that all
necessary consents have been obtained to permit it), no payment stop notice has been issued to the agent or
trustee for the relevant Topco Liabilities and Senior Secured Payment Default or payment default (subject
to a de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than principal, interest or certain fees) is continuing
under the Second Lien Facility Agreement.

Certain specified payments in respect of Topco Liabilities are also permitted at all times, notwithstanding
that a payment stop notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing. These payments and
basket amounts are substantially similar to those referenced for Second Lien Liabilities in (ii) of "Permitted
_Payments in Respect of Second Lien Liabilities" above._

**Turnover**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if, at any time prior to the latest to
occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the first date on which all
of the Second Lien Liabilities have been fully discharged (the "Second Lien Discharge Date") and the first
date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been fully discharged (the "Topco Discharge Date") (the
"Final Discharge Date") any creditor (other than a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation
Date) receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Group or Third Party Security Provider:

(1) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the Liabilities owed to the
creditors under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either (x) not
prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set
out below under "Application of Proceeds";

(2) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement; and

(3) notwithstanding (1) and (2) above, other than when set-of applies, any amount:

(a) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt
Documents (I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any
Transaction Security as a result of such an acceleration event, or (II) as a result of any
other litigation or proceedings against a Debtor, member of the Group or any Third Party
Security Provider (other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event (as defined
below)); or

(b) by way of set-off in respect of any of the Liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an
acceleration event;


-----

other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the provisions set
out below under "Application of Proceeds" and in relation to Intra-Group Liabilities in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement (to the extent permitted to be received or recovered
notwithstanding that an Acceleration Event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) is
continuing);

(4) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under "Application of Proceeds"; or

(5) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the
liabilities owed by any Debtor, any member of the Group or Third Party Security Provider which
is not in accordance with the provisions set out below under "Application of Proceeds" and which
is made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that Debtor,
member of the Group or Third Party Security Provider,

that creditor will:

(1) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an amount
of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or
recovered) on trust for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent and
promptly pay or distribute that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to
the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security
Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(2) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an
amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time on or after the
Designation Date but prior to the Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers
from any Debtor, any member of the Group or Third Party Security Provider (x) any proceeds from the
enforcement of security or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following an acceleration event
or the enforcement of security, any proceeds arising from any of the charged property or (y) any other
amounts which should otherwise be received or recovered by the Security Agent except in accordance with
the provisions set out below under "Application of Proceeds."

**Effect of Insolvency Event**

"Insolvency Event" is defined as, in relation to an Obligor, Material Subsidiary (as defined in the 2023
Senior Facilities Agreement) or Third Party Security Provider, (a) any resolution is passed or order made
for insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration, examination or reorganization
(excluding solvent reorganizations), (b) a composition, compromise, assignment or arrangement with any
class of creditors generally (other than any Secured Party) in connection with or as a result of any financial
difficulty on the part of that Obligor, Material Subsidiary or Third Party Security Provider, (c) a moratorium
is declared in relation to any of its indebtedness, (d) other than on a solvent basis, the appointment of a
liquidator, receiver, examiner, administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other similar
officer in respect of it or a material part of its assets, or (e) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any
jurisdiction, other than (in each case), frivolous or vexatious proceedings, proceedings or appointments
which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Instructing Group (as defined below)) is satisfied
will be withdrawn or unsuccessful or as permitted under the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement or in any
Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or a
Second Lien Facility Agreement, or otherwise not constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party entitled
to receive a distribution out of the assets of a Debtor, Material Subsidiary or Third Party Security Provider
(in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts
constitute proceeds of enforcement) shall direct the person responsible for the distribution to pay that
distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full.
The Security Agent shall apply all such distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out
under "Application of _Proceeds" below._


-----

To the extent any member of the Group's or Third Party Security Provider's liabilities to creditors are, with
certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in the case of a Senior Secured
Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of
enforcement) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off shall
pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the
Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under "Application of Proceeds"
below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent
the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each creditor
irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make demands,
collect and receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery after the
occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to an Obligor, member of the Group or Third Party Security
Provider. The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect
to these provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Instructing Group_

An "Instructing Group" means:

(a) if the Designation Date has not occurred:

(i) prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors;

(ii) on or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but before the Priority Discharge Date, the
Majority Second Lien Creditors; and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, the Majority
Topco Creditors (as defined below); and

(b) at any time on or after the occurrence of the Designation Date and:

(i) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the
Super Senior Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the "Super Senior
**Discharge Date"), the Senior Secured Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors)**
representing more than 50% of the Senior Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior
Liabilities) (the "Majority Senior Secured Creditors"), and Super Senior Creditors
representing more than 50% of the Super Senior Liabilities (the "Majority Super Senior
**Creditors") save that, for instructions relating to enforcement, it shall mean the group of**
Secured Creditors entitled to give instructions in accordance with the enforcement regime
described under "Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the Designation Date" and
"Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the Designation Date" below;

(ii) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge
Date but before the Priority Discharge Date, the Second Lien Creditors representing more
than 50% of the Second Lien Liabilities (the "Majority Second Lien Creditors"); and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, the Topco
Creditors representing more than 50% of the Topco Liabilities (the "Majority Topco
**Creditors").**

_provided that, in each case, the Super Senior Credit Participations, the Senior Secured Credit Participations,_
the Second Lien Credit Participations and the Topco Credit Participations of an Investor Affiliate (as
applicable) shall, for the purposes of this definition, be deemed to be zero.


-----

**Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the Designation Date**

Prior to the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security
unless instructed otherwise by (i) the Instructing Group, (ii) if, prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date,
the Instructing Group has (A) given no instructions or has instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce
or cease enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed
Disposal (as defined below), an agent or trustee under the Second Lien Liabilities (acting on the instructions
of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen
under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (iii) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Instructing Group (or
Majority Second Lien Creditors as applicable) have (A) given no instructions or have instructed the
Security Agent neither to enforce or cease enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or Third Party Security
Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, a Topco Agent or the Topco Notes Trustee (acting on the
instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors).

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, the Instructing
Group or any other persons entitled to give instructions in accordance with the preceding paragraph may
give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the
Transaction Security as they see fit.

Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien
Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the Transaction
Security either give no such instructions or do not indicate any intention to give such instructions, then the
Instructing Group may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as the
Instructing Group sees fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions received from the Instructing
Group.

Unless (i) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event or (ii) the
Instructing Group or any agent of the creditors represented in the Instructing Group determines in good
faith that to do so could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent's
ability to enforce the Transaction Security or the realization proceeds of any such enforcement, before
giving any instructions to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other enforcement action the agents
of the creditors represented in the Instructing Group will be required to consult with each other agent
(provided that any agent or trustee in respect of Topco Liabilities need only be consulted if such
enforcement relates to Topco Shared Security) and the Security Agent in good faith for a period of up to
10 business days (the "Consultation Period") and the Instructing Group will only be entitled to give the
enforcement instructions described above or take any Enforcement Action after the expiry of such
Consultation Period.

**Enforcement of Transaction Security on or after the Designation Date**

On or after the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security
unless instructed otherwise in accordance with the provisions described in the following paragraphs.

If the Transaction Security has become enforceable, if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish to issue enforcement instructions, they shall deliver a copy of those
instructions (an "Initial Enforcement Notice") to the Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and
hedge counterparties.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided that they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) if
the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not either made a determination as to the method of
enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial
Enforcement Notice or the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the Initial
Enforcement Notice, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has
occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency Event (other than an Insolvency Event directly caused by enforcement action
taken at the request of a Super Senior Creditor) is continuing, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the
Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a
determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue and the
Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that a delay could reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on the Security Agent's ability to enforce the Transaction Security or on the
realization of proceeds and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver instructions which they reasonably


-----

believe to be consistent with the Enforcement Principles and necessary or advisable to enhance the
prospects of achieving the Enforcement Objective (as defined below) before the Security Agent has
received any instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors,
until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge
Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super
Senior Creditors have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or
cease enforcing the Transaction Security and neither the Majority Senior Secured Creditor or the Majority
Super Senior Creditors has required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed
Disposal, the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors), where the
rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if,
prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior
Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have
instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or cease enforcing or the Transaction Security and neither the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors nor the Majority Super Senior Creditors has required any Debtor or
Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent (acting on the instructions
of the Majority Topco Creditors), or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) has.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien
Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions either give no such
instruction or do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or Majority Super Senior Creditors, to the extent such group is entitled to give enforcement

"Enforcement Principles" means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that
(i) to the extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the method of enforcement
chosen should maximize the value realized from such enforcement (the "Enforcement Objective"),
(ii) certain proceeds must be received in cash, and (iii) enforcement in relation to secured assets (other than
shares) with a book value over €23,250,000 (equivalent) or shares, in each case, if not carried out by way
of a public auction or other competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent is requested to do so by
the Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit from a fairness opinion
from an independent investment bank, firm of accountants or third-party professional firm which is
regularly engaged in issuing such opinions (subject to certain exceptions).

**Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security**

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its
terms, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority
Topco Creditors) may give or refrain from giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain
from enforcing the Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

**Manner of Enforcement**

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance
with any of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any
administrator of any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as any
persons entitled at any time under the above provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such
instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action).

No Secured Party (other than the Security Agent) shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have
recourse to enforce, any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security or to exercise
any rights or powers arising under the security documents except through the Security Agent.

**Security Held by Other Creditors**

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than the
Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security in accordance with instructions given by the relevant instructing creditors in
accordance with the paragraphs above.

**Enforcement Regime**

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors_

Until the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Secured Discharge Date, except with the
prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group, no Second Lien Creditor shall take or require the
taking of any Enforcement Action against a member of the Group or Third Party Security Provider in
relation to the Second Lien Liabilities except as set out under "Permitted Second Lien Enforcement,"
_provided that no such action required by an Instructing Group need be taken except to the extent such_
Instructing Group otherwise is entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to direct such action.

"Enforcement Action" is defined as:

(1) (A) in relation to any Liabilities (other than unsecured liabilities), the acceleration, the making of
any declaration that such liabilities are payable on demand (subject to certain exceptions), making
certain demands, the making of any demand against any member of the Topco Group in relation
to any guarantee liabilities of that member of the Topco Group, requiring a member of the Topco
Group or Third Party Security Provider to acquire such liabilities (subject to certain exceptions),
exercising any rights of set-off (other than certain netting under hedging agreements or as
otherwise permitted under the Secured Debt Documents) or (B) suing or commencing proceedings
in relation to such liabilities;

(2) premature termination or close-out of a hedging agreement, save to the extent permitted by the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(3) the taking of steps to enforce or require the enforcement of the Transaction Security or, as the case
may be, Topco Independent Transaction Security (including the crystallisation of any floating
charge) as a result of an acceleration event which was continuing at the time the request for
enforcement was made;

(4) entering into any composition, compromise, assignment or similar arrangement with any Third
Party Security Provider or a member of the Topco Group which owes any liabilities or has given
security, guarantees, indemnities or other assurances against loss in respect of liabilities owed to
a creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement (other than any action permitted under "changes to
_the parties" in the Intercreditor Agreement or any debt buy-backs pursuant to open market debt_
repurchases, tender offers or exchange offers not undertaken as part of an announced restructuring
or turnaround plan or while a default was outstanding under the relevant Secured Debt
Documents); or

(5) petitioning, applying, voting for or taking any steps (including the appointment of any liquidator,
receiver, administrator or similar officer) in relation to the winding up, dissolution, administration
or reorganization of any Third Party Security Provider or a member of the Topco Group which
owes any liabilities or has given security or other assurance against loss in respect of liabilities
owed to a creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement or any of such Third Party Security Provider
or member of the Topco Group's assets or any suspension of payments or moratorium of any
indebtedness of any such Third Party Security Provider or member of the Topco Group, or any
analogous procedure or step in any jurisdiction,

except that the following shall not constitute Enforcement Action: (A) taking any action referred to in
paragraph (i)(B) and (v) where necessary to preserve the validity, existence or priority of claims in respect
of liabilities, (B) discussions or consultations between or proposals made by the Priority Secured Parties
with respect to enforcement of the Transaction Security in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement,
(C) bringing proceedings in connection with a securities violation, securities or listing regulations or
common law fraud or to restrain any breach of the Debt Documents or for specific performance with no
claims for damages, (D) proceedings brought by a Secured Party solely to obtain injunctive relief, specific
performance with no claim for damages or to request judicial interpretation in relation to a Debt Document
to which it is party with no claim for damages, (E) demands made by Intra-Group Lenders or Subordinated
Creditors to the extent they relate to payments permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or the release
of the liabilities owed to such creditors in return for the issue of shares in the relevant member of the Group
_provided that the ownership interest of the member of the Group prior to such issue is not diluted and any_
relevant shares remain subject to the same Transaction Security as existed prior to the issue and


-----

(F) proceedings brought by an ancillary lender, a lender of Cash Management Facility Liabilities (a "Cash
**Management Facility Lender"), hedge counterparty, issuing bank, or agent or trustee in respect of the**
Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities solely to obtain injunctive relief, specific performance with no
claim for damages or to request judicial interpretation in relation to a Debt Document to which it is party
with no claim for damages or in connection with any securities violation, securities or listing regulations or
common law fraud or to restrain any breach of the Debt Documents or for specific performance with no
claims for damages.

**Permitted Second Lien Enforcement**

The restrictions set out above under "Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors" will not apply
in respect of any of the Second Lien Liabilities owed to it if at the same time as, or prior to, that action:

(1) a Super Senior Acceleration Event or a Senior Acceleration Event or a Senior Secured Notes
Acceleration Event has occurred in which case, each Second Lien Creditor may take the same
Enforcement Action (but in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities) as constitutes that Super Senior
Acceleration Event or Senior Acceleration Event or Senior Secured Notes Acceleration Event;

(2) a Second Lien Creditor Representative has given notice (a "Second Lien Enforcement Notice")
to the Security Agent specifying that a second lien event of default (save and except arising
pursuant to a breach of any provisions in the relevant Second Lien Facility Agreement relating to
cross default (including to the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement or any Permitted Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement or Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement)) under the Second
Lien Finance Documents in respect of which it is an agent has occurred and is continuing and:

(A) a period (a "Second Lien Standstill Period") of not less than:

(1) 90 days in the case of a failure to make a payment of an amount of principal,
interest or fees representing the Second Lien Liabilities; or

(2) 120 days in the case of an event of default under any financial maintenance
covenant in any Second Lien Facility Agreement substantially equivalent to the
Financial Covenant of the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement; and

(3) 150 days in the case of any other second lien event of default,

or, in relation to any Second Lien Liabilities, such longer period (if any) as agreed
between Topco (in its discretion) and the Second Lien Creditor Representative in relation
to such Second Lien Liabilities and notified to the Security Agent in each case which has
elapsed from the date on which that Second Lien Enforcement Notice becomes effective
in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) that second lien event of default is continuing at the end of the Second Lien Standstill
Period; or

(3) at the same time as or prior to that action the consent of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and
the Majority Super Senior Creditors for that Enforcement Action is obtained.

To the extent permitted under applicable law, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, each Second
Lien Creditor may (unless otherwise directed by the Security Agent or unless the Security Agent has taken,
or has given notice that it intends to take, action on behalf of that Second Lien Creditor) exercise any right
they may otherwise have against that Debtor, Material Subsidiary or Third Party Security Provider to:

(1) accelerate any of that Debtor's or, as the case may be, Third Party Security Provider's or Material
Subsidiary's Second Lien Liabilities or declare them prematurely due and payable or payable on
demand;

(2) make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given by that
Debtor or, as the case may be, Third Party Security Provider or Material Subsidiary in respect of
any Second Lien Liabilities;


-----

(3) exercise any right of set off or take or receive any payment or claim in respect of any Second Lien
Liabilities of that Debtor or, as the case may be, Third Party Security Provider or Material
Subsidiary; or

(4) claim and prove in the liquidation, administration or other insolvency proceedings of that Debtor
or, as the case may be, Third Party Security Provider or Material Subsidiary for the Second Lien
Liabilities owing to it.

**Option to Purchase: Second Lien Creditors**

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior
Secured Creditor Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities, Second Lien Creditors may,
subject to certain conditions, elect to purchase the Senior Lender Liabilities, Super Senior Lender
Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities and the Cash Management Facility Liabilities for the amount
that would have been required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and
expenses. Second Lien Creditors must also, at the same time, elect for the counterparties to hedging
obligations to transfer their hedging obligations to holders in exchange (subject to specified conditions) for
the amount that would have been payable under such hedging obligations had they been terminated on such
date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase.

**Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors**

Certain of the features set out above with respect to Second Lien Creditors apply to the Topco Creditors,
with appropriate modifications for the relative positions of the relevant liabilities in the capital structure of
the Group.

**Non-Distressed Disposals**

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to a
document evidencing the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security shall (and is
irrevocably authorized, instructed and obliged to do so without further consent, agreement or instruction
from any creditor, other Secured Party or Debtor), and without prejudice to its rights and protections under
the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Debt Document, promptly following receipt of a written request
from the Issuer:

(1) release (or procure the release) from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security and the Secured Debt Documents:

(A) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document but excluding any claim
relating to an Independent Security Finance Document and/or unsecured liabilities) over
any asset which the Issuer has confirmed is the subject of:

(1) a disposal not prohibited under the Finance Documents or where any applicable
release and/or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance
Document including a disposal to a member of the Group but without prejudice
to any obligation of any member of the Group in a Finance Document to provide
replacement security; or

(2) any other transaction not prohibited by the Finance Documents pursuant to
which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Group (or,
to the extent any applicable Finance Document prohibits such transaction, the
applicable Agent authorizes the release in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Finance Document or the required creditor consent for such
transaction has been obtained); and

in each case where such disposal or other transaction is not a Distressed Disposal (as
defined below) (in each case, a "Non-Distressed Disposal");

(B) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document but excluding any claim
relating to an Independent Security Finance Document and/or unsecured liabilities) over
any document or other agreement requested in order for any member of the Group to
effect any amendment or waiver or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any


-----

obligation or take any action in relation to such document or agreement (to the extent the
Issuer has confirmed that such action is not prohibited by any Finance Document);

(C) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document but excluding any claim
relating to an Independent Security Finance Document) over any asset of any member of
the Group which has ceased or will cease to be a Debtor or guarantor to the extent the
Issuer has confirmed that such ceasing to be a Debtor or guarantor in accordance with the
terms of each Finance Document or the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the
2023 Senior Facilities Agreement); and

(D) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document but excluding any claim
relating to an Independent Security Finance Document and/or unsecured liabilities) over
any other asset to the extent the Issuer has confirmed that such security is not required to
be given or such release in accordance with the terms of any Finance Document or the
Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement);

(2) in the case of a disposal of share or ownership interest in a Debtor, other member of the Group or
any holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, other
member of the Group or any holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member of the
Topco Group or a Debtor, in each case that is not prohibited by the terms of the Secured Debt
Documents (or, to the extent any applicable Secured Debt Document prohibits such disposal, the
applicable Agent authorizes the release in accordance with the terms of the applicable Secured
Debt Document or the required creditor consent for such disposal has been obtained) release or
procure the release of that Debtor or other member of the Group and its subsidiaries from all
present and future liabilities under the Secured Debt Documents and the respective assets of such
Debtor and its subsidiaries from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security and the Secured Debt Documents (including any claim relating to a Debt Document).

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (i)(A), (i)(B) or (ii) above, the Issuer shall
certify in writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not prohibited as at the
date of completion of such release or, at the option of the Issuer, on the date that the definitive agreement
for such disposal or similar transaction is entered into.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i)(C) or (i)(D) above, the Issuer shall certify
in writing to the Security Agent, that such security is not required to be given or the relevant release or
cessation is otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents or the Agreed Security
Principles (as defined in the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement).

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor, member of the Group or holding
company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, member of the Group or
holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member of Topco Group or a Debtor, to the extent the
Issuer has confirmed to the Security Agent that it is not prohibited by the Finance Documents, if such
member of the Topco Group or a Debtor is a borrower, issuer or primary debtor under any Debt Document,
such person shall have the right to voluntarily prepay all Liabilities outstanding under any Debt Document
to the applicable creditors.

**Distressed Disposals**

"Distressed Disposal" means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by a
member of the Group or, in the case of a Third Party Security Provider, any assets or shares or financial
securities which are subject to the Transaction Security which is being effected (a) at the request of an
Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of
an acceleration event, (b) by enforcement of the Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration event,
or (c) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of security as a result of an
acceleration event, by a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to a person or persons which is not a
member of the Topco Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the
cost of the relevant Debtor, Third Party Security Provider and the Issuer and without any consent, sanction,


-----

authority or further confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third Party Security
Provider or Debtor):

(1) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset, enter into any release of that
Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallisation of any floating charge or
any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be necessary or desirable;

(2) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release:

(A) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing,
guarantee or other liabilities;

(B) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over
any of its assets; and

(C) any other claim of an Intra-Group Lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or
another Debtor over that Debtor's assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that
Debtor,

on behalf of the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(3) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a
Debtor to release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all
or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (B) any Transaction Security granted
by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets, and
(C) any other claim of an Intra-Group Lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or another
Debtor over that holding company's assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on
behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(4) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company
of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement)
decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or holding company or
any of their subsidiaries to creditors or other Debtors:

(A) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not
intend that any transferee of those liabilities (the "Transferee") will be treated as a
Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or
enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities, _provided that,_
notwithstanding any other provision of any Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be
treated as a Secured Creditor or Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement; and

(B) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend
that any Transferee will be treated as a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and not
part only) of the liabilities owed to the Secured Parties and all or part of any other
liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(5) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company
of a Debtor (the "Disposed Entity") and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the "Receiving Entity") all or any
part of the Disposed Entity's obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed Entity
in respect of the intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to execute and deliver or
enter into any agreement to:

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities
to any Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those
obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and


-----

(B) (provided that the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which
is also a Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part
of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities, liabilities owed to Debtors on
behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect
of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to Debtors are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as described
above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under
"—Application of Proceeds" below as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the
Transaction Security and, to the extent any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities
had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the Security
Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market
conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed
Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to
give and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not
authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or
guarantee liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee
liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any
contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the
subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to give,
and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not
authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or
guarantee liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those
borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien
Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of
credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements
acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release.

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Senior
Secured Notes Proceeds Loan Liabilities, Topco Liabilities or unsecured liabilities would otherwise be
released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing
liabilities transferred to a holding company of the Issuer, in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably
authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or
further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer
those borrowing liabilities.

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date or the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal is being
effected such that the Second Lien Liabilities or the Topco Liabilities and Transaction Security over shares
in a borrower, issuer or guarantor of, or over assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor of, Second Lien
Liabilities or guarantor of the Topco Liabilities will be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, it
is a further condition to the release, transfer or disposal that either:

(1) the Second Lien Agent, second lien notes trustee, Topco Agent and Topco Notes Trustee (as
applicable) have approved the release; or

(2) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Second Lien Liabilities or
Topco Guarantor are sold:

(A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash) and/or other
marketable securities or, if the proceeds of such sale or disposal are not in cash (or
substantially in cash) and/or other marketable securities, a valuation opinion has been
obtained in accordance with the provisions set out below; and

(B) all claims of the Secured Creditors (other than in relation to performance bonds or
guarantees or similar instruments issued by a Secured Creditor on behalf of a member of


-----

the Group) against a member of the Group (if any) all of whose shares (other than any
minority interest not owned by members of the Group) are pledged in favor of the Priority
Secured Parties and are being sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action,
are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such
sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all Transaction
Security and other security in favor of the Secured Parties in respect of the assets that are
sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged
concurrently with such sale, provided that in the event of a sale or disposal of any such
claim (instead of a release or discharge):

(1) where the Senior Secured Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the
Original Senior Agent and the Issuer (i) determine, acting reasonably and in
good faith, that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover more than if such
claim was released or discharged but nevertheless less than the outstanding
Senior Secured Liabilities, and (ii) serve a notice on the Security Agent
notifying the Security Agent of the same;

(2) where the Second Lien Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Second
Lien Agent and any second lien notes trustee (i) determine acting reasonably
and in good faith that the Priority Secured Parties (collectively) will recover
more than if such claim was released or discharged but nevertheless less than
the outstanding amount of the liabilities owed to the Priority Secured Parties
(the "Priority Secured Liabilities"), and (ii) serve a notice on the Security
Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same; and

(3) where the Topco Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Topco Agent
and the Topco Notes Trustee (i) determine acting reasonably and in good faith
that the Priority Secured Parties and the Topco Creditors (collectively) will
recover more than if such claim was released or discharged but is nevertheless
less than the outstanding Priority Secured Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities
(collectively), and serve a notice on the Security Agent notifying the Security
Agent of the same;

in which case the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such
claim to such purchaser (or an affiliate of such purchaser) and the consideration for such
sale or transfer may be in the form of non-cash consideration by way of the Senior
Secured Creditors, Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors (whichever constitutes the
Instructing Group) bidding by an appropriate mechanic all or part of the Senior Secured
Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities (as applicable) such that the
relevant liabilities would on completion be discharged to the extent of an amount equal
to the amount of the offer made by the relevant creditors; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

(1) pursuant to a public auction or other competitive sale process run in accordance
with the advice of a reputable, independent and internationally recognised
investment bank, firm of accountants or third-party professional firm which is
regularly engaged in such sale processes with a view to obtaining the best price
reasonably obtainable taking into account all relevant circumstances and in
which creditors under the Second Lien Liabilities and Topco Liabilities are
entitled to participate as prospective buyers and/or financiers; or

(2) where a reputable, independent and internationally recognised investment bank,
firm of accountants or third-party professional firm which is regularly engaged
in providing such valuations has delivered an opinion (including an enterprise
valuation of the Group which can be relied upon by the Security Agent and
disclosed to the Senior Secured Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the
Topco Creditors on a non-reliance basis) in respect of such sale or disposal that
the amount is fair from a financial point of view, taking into account all relevant
circumstances including the method of enforcement, provided that the liability
of such investment bank or internationally recognised firm of accountants or


-----

third-party professional firm in giving such opinion may be limited to the
amount of its fees in respect of such engagement.

-----

**_Equitably Subordinated Creditors_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, notwithstanding the provisions set out under "—Order of
_Application—Transaction Security" and "—Order of Application—Topco Independent Transaction_
_Security" above, to the extent that the Recoveries held by the Security Agent are insufficient to discharge_
the liabilities owe to all the creditors in any class of creditors and this is due to any Equitably Subordinated
Creditor being part of that class of creditors, the amount to be applied by the Security Agent in discharge
of the liabilities of that class of creditors shall be distributed to the other creditors of that class and the
Equitably Subordinated Creditor shall not be entitled to receive any part of that amount. For the avoidance
of doubt, once the liabilities of creditors which are not Equitably Subordinated Creditors are discharged in
full, any excess shall be paid to the Equitably Subordinated Creditors.

An Equitably Subordinated Creditor shall not have the benefit, but only the obligations, of any sharing
provisions under the Debt Documents and shall not be entitled to receive any payment, and neither the
Security Agent nor the Agent shall be required to make any payment to the Equitably Subordinated
Creditor, under or in connection with the Debt Documents in respect of any Equitably Subordinated
Liabilities.

To the extent that any Equitably Subordinated Liabilities would result in the subordination of liabilities
towards any other creditors under any Debt Document pursuant to Section 39 paragraph 1 no. 5 of the
German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) or the Austrian Equity Substitution Act (Eigenkapitalersatz_Gesetz – EKEG) or prejudice the validity or enforceability of any Transaction Security or guarantee and/or_
indemnity provided to any creditor pursuant to the Debt Documents in any way, the relevant Equitably
Subordinated Creditor shall be deemed not to be a Secured Party under any Transaction Security Document
and shall not benefit from the guarantee or indemnity.

"Equitably Subordinated Creditor" means any creditor whose commitments, any other participation
rights (including by way of sub-participation) and/or any other rights and claims under the Debt Documents
against a German Debtor which, prior to or in an insolvency of the Debtor, would be subordinated or could
be subject to potential avoidance claims pursuant to Section 39 paragraph 1 no. 5, Section 39 par a. 2 or
Section 135 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) or Section 6 of the German Avoidance
Act (Anfechtungsgesetz) or the Austrian Equity Substitution Act (Eigenkapitalersatz-Gesetz – EKEG) (the
"Equitably Subordinated Liabilities").

**Equalization**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super Senior
Liabilities, Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain unpaid after the
first date on which certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the "Enforcement Date") and the
resulting losses are not borne by the creditors in any given specified class in the proportions which their
respective exposures at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors in that
specified class at the Enforcement Date, the relevant class of creditors will make such payments amongst
themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the relevant creditors in such a position that (after
taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions. The enforceability of these
equalization provisions is uncertain.

**Required Consents**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or
waived only with the consent of the Issuer, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties, and the Security
Agent, provided that, to the extent an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class of creditors, and
such amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected materially or adversely to affect the
interests of the other classes of creditors, only written agreement from the agent or trustee acting on behalf
of the affected class (or, in the case of Hedge Counterparties, each affected Hedge Counterparty) and the
Issuer shall be required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates to,
among other matters, the provisions set out under "Application of Proceeds" above and the order of priority
or subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent of each of the
agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior Liabilities,
the Super Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities, each Cash Management


-----

Facility Lender (only to the extent the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect
the rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement and
would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors),
each Hedge Counterparty (only to the extent the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely
affect the rights and obligations of such Hedge Counterparty under the Intercreditor Agreement and would
not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), and the
Issuer.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it
represents or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such instructions
or authorizations in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented or authorized
to relate to any provision affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee in its capacity
as such).

**Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents**

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below), the Security Agent
may, if the Issuer consents: (i) amend the terms of, release or waive any of the requirements of or grant
consents under, any document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security
which shall be binding on each party; (ii) amend or release and retake any Transaction Security Documents
or Topco Independent Transaction Security Documents where such amendment or release and retake is
required or desirable in order to ensure the validity, perfection or priority of the Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security purported to be created under such Transaction Security
Document or Topco Independent Transaction Security Document (as applicable), together with any related
or consequential waiver and any such amendment, release, waiver and retake shall be binding on each party;
and (iii) any amendment, release or waiver of, or consent under, any Transaction Security Document or
Topco Independent Transaction Security Document which would adversely affect the nature or scope of
the assets subject to Transaction Security or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security are distributed, shall not be made without
the prior consent of the Secured Creditors and the Issuer.

**Exceptions**

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or obligations
which are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such (including, without
limitation, any ability of that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement) may
not be effected without the consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the first paragraph above under "Amendments and Waivers: Transaction
_Security Documents" are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in_
particular to (i) any release of Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security, claim or
liabilities, or (ii) any amendment waiver or consent, which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in
accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the incurrence of additional or
refinancing debt or the provisions set out under "New Debt Financing," "Non-Distressed Disposals" and
"Distressed Disposals" above. Any release, amendment, waiver or consent effected in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the Debt Documents relating to such matters can be effected solely by the Issuer and
the Security Agent.

**Snooze/Lose**

If in relation to a request for a consent, to participate in a vote of a class of creditors, to approve any action
or to provide any confirmation or notification, in each case, under the Intercreditor Agreement or any other
Debt Document which does not contain a snooze/lose provision substantially similar to that contained in
the Intercreditor Agreement, any Secured Creditor or Unsecured Creditor fails to respond to the request
within 10 business days (or any other period of time notified by the Issuer, with the agreement of each of
the agents or trustee in the case of a shorter period of time) of that request being made or fails to provide
details of its credit participation, at the Issuer's option with respect to each individual creditor: (i) such
creditor will be disregarded and be deemed to have zero participation in respect of the matter or be deemed
to have provided the relevant confirmation or notification, as applicable, provided that the foregoing shall
not apply to any noteholder in respect of any request where such noteholder is not given the option to
respond to such request in the negative, but shall otherwise apply to all noteholders or (ii) such creditor


-----

shall be deemed (other than for the purposes of determining any consent fee or similar arrangement) to have
given its consent or agreement to such request (or to have given such confirmation or notification) and such
consent, agreement, confirmation or notification shall be deemed to have been received by the Security
Agent, and such consent, agreement, confirmation or notification shall from such time be irrevocable and
binding on such creditor and its permitted successors, assigns and transferees.

**Provisions Following an IPO**

Following or in contemplation of an initial public offering of a member of the Group (or a holding company
thereof) (an "IPO"), the Issuer is entitled to require (by written notice to each Agent and Hedge
Counterparty) (a "Pushdown Notice") that the terms of the Debt Documents will automatically operate so
that, amongst other things, (i) the Group (and all related provisions) will now refer to the member of the
Group or holding company of the Issuer who will issue shares or whose shares are to be sold pursuant to
such IPO (the "IPO Pushdown Entity," and if (x) any Topco Notes are not refinanced in full on or before
the date of such IPO, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be any holding company of the Issuer which is the
issuer or borrower of any Topco Liabilities or (y) the Topco Notes have been refinanced in full on or before
the date of such IPO but the Senior Secured Notes have not, the Issuer shall be the IPO Pushdown Entity)
and its Restricted Subsidiaries, (ii) all financial ratio, basket and financial definition calculations shall be
made excluding any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be
assumed at the level of the IPO Pushdown Entity (or as otherwise permitted pursuant to the terms of the
relevant Debt Documents, and (iii) certain provisions of the Debt Documents (including representations,
undertakings and events of default) will cease to apply to any holding company of the IPO Pushdown
Entity. The Issuer is entitled to revoke its Pushdown Notice at any time prior to the occurrence of the
relevant IPO event. In the event that any Pushdown Notice is revoked each of the changes specified in (i)
to (iii) (inclusive) above shall no longer apply.

Each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be released from all obligations under the Debt
Documents (including any Transaction Security or, as the case may be, Topco Independent Transaction
Security) and each Subordinated Creditor, Third Party Security Provider, Investor (as defined in the 2023
Senior Facilities Agreement or any other Finance Document) or Topco Independent Obligor will be
released from its obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity.
In the event that the Issuer revokes its Pushdown Notice, the relevant member of the Group is required (if
instructed by an Instructing Group) to (x) execute replacement Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security and (y) (by way of accession) accede to the Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate
capacity.

Subject to the consent of the majority lenders under and as defined in the Senior Lender Liabilities,
noteholders representing more than 50% of any Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under
and as defined in any Second Lien Facility Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50% of any
Second Lien Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in any Topco Facility and
noteholders representing more than 50% of any Topco Notes Liabilities (following the relevant IPO), each
subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall also be released from all obligations as Debtor and guarantor
under the Debt Documents and from the Transaction Security (other than, in each case, borrowing
liabilities). Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment, release
or replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate such matters.

**Agreement to Override**

Unless expressly stated otherwise therein, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything in any other Debt
Documents to the contrary.

"Issuer") will issue €           aggregate principal amount of           % senior secured notes due
2031 (the "Notes") under an indenture (the "Indenture") between, among others, the Issuer, the Guarantors,
U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (the "Trustee"), Alter Domus Trustees (UK) Limited, as security
agent (the "Security Agent") and Elavon Financial Services DAC, as Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer
Agent (each as defined below). For purposes of this section, the word "Issuer" refers only to Ephios Subco 3
S.à r.l. and any successor obligor to the Issuer and not to any of its subsidiaries; the word "Target" refers
only to SYNLAB AG and any successor obligor to the Target, and not to any of its subsidiaries, and the
terms "we," "our," "us" and "Group" each refer to the Issuer and, where the context so requires, all of its
Subsidiaries (including, from the Completion Date, the Target and its consolidated subsidiaries). Any
reference to a "Holder" or a "Noteholder" in this "Description of the Notes" refers to the registered holders
of the Notes. The terms of the Notes include those expressly set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture will
not incorporate or include any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

This offering of the Notes will be consummated on the Issue Date, which date will be prior to the
consummation of the Acquisition. Pending consummation of the Acquisition and the satisfaction of certain
other conditions as described below, the Issuer will deposit or arrange to have deposited the gross proceeds
of this offering of the Notes into an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") pursuant to the terms of an
escrow agreement (the "Escrow Agreement"), dated on or about the Issue Date among the Issuer, the
Trustee and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., acting through its London branch, as escrow agent (the
"Escrow Agent"). The Escrow Agreement, including the conditions to the release of the Escrowed Funds
(as defined below), is more fully described below under "—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption." In the event the conditions to the release of the Escrowed Funds have not occurred on or prior_
to 11:59 p.m. (London time) on September 29, 2024 (the "Escrow Longstop Date"), or upon the
occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be redeemed at a price equal to 100.0% of the initial issue
price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date,
or, if applicable, from the most recent date on which interest with respect to the Notes was paid or provided
for, to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below). See "—Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption." Upon release from the Escrow Account, the proceeds of this_
offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date, together with (a) borrowings under the New Term Loan B,
(b) the proceeds of certain committed and fully subordinated PIK debt to be issued by Ephios Subco 1 on
or prior to the Completion Date and on-lent to the Issuer and (c) cash on the Target's balance sheet, will be
lent to the Bidder and used to (i) fund the consideration payable for the Acquisition, (ii) repay certain
existing external indebtedness of the Target Group and (iii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the
Transactions. For further information, see "The Transactions" and "Use of Proceeds."

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €           aggregate principal
amount of Notes will be issued in this offering of the Notes. We may, subject to applicable law, issue an
unlimited principal amount of additional Notes (the "Additional Notes"). The Notes and any Additional
Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the
Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to
purchase, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture. We will only be permitted to issue Additional
Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenants restricting the
Incurrence of Indebtedness and the Incurrence of Liens (as described below under "—Certain Covenants—
_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" and "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on_
_Liens"). Unless the context otherwise requires, in this "Description of the Notes," references to the "Notes"_
include the Notes and any Additional Notes that are actually issued under the Indenture.

The Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined herein). The terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement are important to understanding the terms and ranking of the Liens on the Collateral securing the
Notes and any Note Guarantee. See "Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement" for a
description of the material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Indenture and the Notes and refers to the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Transaction Security Documents, the Escrow Account Charge and the Escrow


-----

Agreement. This description does not purport to be complete nor does it restate those agreements in their
entirety. You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under the subheading "—
_Certain Definitions." Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under "—Certain_
_Definitions" have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. We urge you to read the Indenture_
because it, and not this description, defines your rights as holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the
form of Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents are available from us
as set forth under "Listing and General Information."

**Brief Description of the Notes**

As of the Issue Date and prior to the Completion Date, the Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer,
secured only by the Escrow Account Charge.

From and after the Completion Date, the Notes will:

- be general senior obligations of the Issuer;

- be secured as set forth below under "—Security";

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness or obligation of the
Issuer that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes (including the obligations
of the Issuer under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the New Term Loan B);

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer
that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

- be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Guarantors as set forth below under "—Guarantees";

- be effectively senior to any existing and future Indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer that is not
secured by the Collateral, to the extent of the value of such Collateral;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation (including
obligations to trade creditors) of the Issuer that is secured by property and assets that do not secure
the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness or
obligations;

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation (including
obligations to trade creditors) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes; and

- be structurally subordinated, but effectively senior, to the Target Group's borrowings that remain
outstanding under the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B, if any, to the extent of the value of the
Collateral.

**_The Note Guarantees_**

The Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior secured basis. Subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, within 180 days following the Control Date and substantially simultaneously with the guarantees
granted in favor of obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the New Term Loan B, the
Target and certain Subsidiaries of the Target listed below under the caption "—Note Guarantees"
(collectively with any other Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the Notes from time to time, the
"Guarantors") will guarantee the Notes. In addition, if required under the Intercreditor Agreement, certain
other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the future.

The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will:

- be a general senior obligation of the relevant Guarantor;

- be secured as set forth below under "—Security";

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of that
Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantor's Note


-----

Guarantee (including the senior guarantee given in favor of the New Revolving Credit Facility and
the New Term Loan B);

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of that
Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

- be effectively senior to any existing and future Indebtedness or obligation of that Guarantor that is
not secured by the Collateral owned by such Guarantor, to the extent of the value of such Collateral
owned by such Guarantor;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation (including
obligations to trade creditors) of that Guarantor that is secured with property or assets that do not
secure that Guarantor's Note Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing
such Indebtedness or obligation; and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation (including
obligations to trade creditors) of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantor (other than the Issuer) that do
not guarantee the Notes.

The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will be in respect of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
(including any Additional Notes) plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts thereon. The
obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant
Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful
financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, capital
maintenance rules, thin capitalization rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share
capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or
other limitations under applicable law which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be
guaranteed by reference to the net assets and legal capital of the relevant Guarantor. By virtue of these
limitations, a Guarantor's obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts
payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note
Guarantee. Additionally, any Note Guarantee will be subject to certain corporate law procedures being
complied with. See "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security
_Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations." Any Note Guarantee will be further limited as_
required under the Agreed Security Principles that will apply to and restrict the granting of guarantees and
security in favor of obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the New Term Loan B and the
Notes, which will provide, among other things, that no guarantees or security will be required if any such
grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements. By virtue of these
limitations, a Guarantor's obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts
payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may effectively have no obligation under its Note
Guarantee.

The Issuer is a newly incorporated holding company, with no material operations of its own and only limited
assets, other than its interest in the issued and outstanding shares of its subsidiaries and outstanding
indebtedness and intercompany balances incurred in connection with the Acquisition and the other
transactions described in this Offering Memorandum. All of the operations of the Issuer are conducted
through its Subsidiaries and, therefore, the Issuer will depend on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet
its obligations, including the Issuer's obligations under the Notes.

Not all of the Issuer's existing and future subsidiaries are required to guarantee the Notes and not all of the
Issuer's Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. In addition, there are certain circumstances where the Note
Guarantees may not be granted pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles. Furthermore, a Note Guarantee
may be released in compliance with the Indenture. See "—Releases of Note Guarantees."

As of the Completion Date, all of the Issuer's Subsidiaries will be "Restricted Subsidiaries" for the purposes
of the Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under "—Certain Definitions—
_Unrestricted Subsidiary," we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer_
and any Person of which the Issuer at any time is or becomes a Subsidiary) as "Unrestricted Subsidiaries."
Such Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and
will not guarantee the Notes.


-----

**_Principal, Maturity and Interest_**

The Issuer will issue €          in aggregate principal amount of Notes in this offering. The Notes will
mature on January 31, 2031.

Each Note will bear interest at a rate of      % per annum from           , 2023, or from the most
recent date to which interest thereon has been paid or provided for. Interest will be payable in cash semiannually in arrear to Holders on           and           of each year, commencing          ,
2024. The Issuer will make a payment to the Holder of record of the Notes on the Clearing System Business
Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date (where "Clearing System Business Day"
means a day on which each of Euroclear Bank SA/NV ("Euroclear") and Clearstream Banking, société
_anonyme ("Clearstream") or such other clearing system for which the Global Notes (as defined below) are_
being held is open for business). Interest will be paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve
30-day months.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes will be subject to applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a
Clearing System Business Day or a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the
Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Clearing System
Business Day or Business Day at such place, as applicable, and will not be entitled to any further interest
or other payment as a result of any such delay.

Interest on overdue principal and interest, as applicable, will accrue at a rate that is 1.00% higher than the
then applicable rate of interest. In no event, however, will the rate of interest on the Notes be higher than
the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. Interest on the Notes shall be payable entirely in cash.

**_Other Terms_**

Principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, the Notes will be payable, and the Notes may be
exchanged or transferred, at the office or agency designated by the Issuer for such purposes (which initially
shall be the designated corporate trust office of the Paying Agent).

Principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, Notes in global form registered in the name or held by
the common depositary of Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee in immediately available funds will
be payable to Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered Holder of
such global Note. See "Book-Entry, Delivery and Form."

The Notes will be issued only in fully registered form, without coupons. The Notes will be issued only in
minimum denominations of €100,000 and any integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into the Escrow
Agreement with the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, pursuant to which the Issuer will deposit or will arrange
to have deposited with the Escrow Agent an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of the Notes sold
on the Issue Date into the Escrow Account. The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account, including
all other funds credited to the Escrow Account and less any funds paid in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement, are referred to, collectively, as the "Escrowed Funds." The Issuer will assign and charge its
beneficial and any other right to and interest in respect of amounts standing to the credit of the Escrow
Account to the Trustee (on behalf of and for the benefit of the holders of the Notes) pursuant to an account
charge on a first priority basis dated as of the date of the Escrow Agreement between the Issuer and the
Trustee (the "Escrow Account Charge").

**_Escrow Release_**

The Issuer will only be entitled to direct the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Funds in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Escrowed Funds will be
released (the "Escrow **Release") to, or at the order of, the Issuer upon delivery by the Issuer to the Escrow**
Agent and the Trustee of a Completion Certificate (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) in the form set
out in the Escrow Agreement addressed to the Escrow Agent and the Trustee prior to the Escrow Longstop
Date, upon which both the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall rely, without further investigation, certifying,


-----

_inter alia, that the following conditions have been met or will be satisfied on or prior to the Business Day_
immediately following the Escrow Release:

(1) prior to or substantially concurrently with the Escrow Release, all conditions precedent to the
execution and delivery of the Investment Agreement, including completion of requisite anti-trust
approvals (other than the release of the Escrowed Funds) have been satisfied or waived;

(2) substantially concurrently with the Escrow Release, the Acquisition shall be consummated in
accordance with the terms of the Investment Agreement and the Acquisition Offer Document in
all material respects;

(3) no Default or Event of Default (each as defined in the Indenture) shall have occurred and be
continuing under the Indenture; and

(4) neither the Escrow Agent nor the Trustee shall have any duty or obligation to verify or investigate
the satisfaction of any conditions for release of the Escrowed Funds.

The Escrow Release will occur promptly following the delivery of the Completion Certificate (as defined
in the Escrow Agreement). Upon Escrow Release, the Escrowed Funds will be paid out in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Account will be reduced to zero.

**_Special Mandatory Redemption_**

In the event that (a) the satisfaction of the conditions set forth under the heading titled "—Escrow Release"
above does not take place on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (b) the Issuer certifies to the Trustee
and the Escrow Agent that the Acquisition Offer has been validly and conclusively terminated, or that, in
the reasonable judgment of the Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated by the Escrow Longstop
Date, (c) the Initial Investors cease to beneficially own and control, directly or indirectly, a majority of the
issued and outstanding Capital Stock of Ephios Subco 2 on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date or (d)
there is an Event of Default with respect to the Issuer under clauses (5) or (6) of the first paragraph under
the heading titled "—Events of Default" below on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date (each such event
being a "Special **Mandatory Redemption Event"), the Issuer will redeem all of the Notes (the "Special**
**Mandatory Redemption") at a price equal to 100.0% of the initial issue price of the Notes plus accrued**
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date, or, if applicable, from the most
recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for, to, but not including, the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date (the "Special Mandatory Redemption Price").

Following the occurrence of a Special Mandatory Redemption Event and at least three Business Days
before the date on which the Escrowed Funds are to be released from the Escrow Account to effect a Special
Mandatory Redemption, the Issuer will give notice of the occurrence of a Special Mandatory Redemption
Event to the Holders and shall also notify and provide payment instructions to the Trustee, the Paying Agent
and the Escrow Agent in an Officer's Certificate in the form set out in the Escrow Agreement.

Promptly following the release of the Escrowed Funds, the Issuer will perform the Special Mandatory
Redemption (the date of such redemption, the "Special Mandatory Redemption Date").

Receipt by the Trustee of a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption (provided that funds sufficient to pay
the Special Mandatory Redemption Price are in the Escrow Account) shall constitute deemed consent by
the Trustee for the release of the Escrowed Funds from the Escrow Account Charge.

On the Business Day prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall apply funds
standing to the credit of the Escrow Account to make a transfer from the Escrow Account to the Paying
Agent for payment to each Holder of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder's Notes and,
concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver the excess Escrowed Funds (if any) after payment
of any fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent and Trustee to the Issuer.

In order to facilitate full payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price in the event that the Special
Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption exceeds the amount of
the Escrowed Funds, on or before the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Sponsor will contribute an
amount necessary to, among other things, fund the accrued and unpaid interest, and Additional Amounts,
if any, owing to the Holders of the Notes, pursuant to an agreement between the Issuer and such Initial


-----

Investors. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—If the Acquisition is not completed, you may not
_obtain the return that you expect on the Notes."_

No provisions of the Escrow Agreement (including those relating to the release of the Escrowed Funds)
may be waived or modified in any manner materially adverse to the Holders without the written consent of
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes outstanding; provided that no such amendment,
waiver or modification shall reduce the Special Mandatory Redemption Price without the written consent
of each affected Holder.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange that the Special
Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such Special Mandatory
Redemption.

**_Activities Prior to Escrow Release_**

Prior to the Completion Date, the Issuer's primary activities will be restricted to issuing the Notes, amending
its by-laws and its governance structure, issuing Capital Stock to, receiving capital contributions from, and
entering into shareholder loans with, any parent company, entering into the 2023 Senior Facilities

including with respect to the New Revolving Credit Facility and the New Term Loan B, and entering into
the Indenture, Intercreditor Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, entering into other agreements in
connection with the Transactions as described in this Offering Memorandum, performing its obligations in
respect of the Notes under the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement (and any other agreements related thereto),
and the purchase agreement with the Initial Purchasers, activities related to listing the Notes on the Official

or indirectly, to consummate the Acquisition, consummating the Escrow Release, performing rights and
obligations under the Acquisition Offer Document, consummating the Acquisition (including releasing
funds from the Escrow Account, paying the purchase price, giving notices and delivering closing
documents) and conducting such other activities as are necessary, advisable or appropriate to carry out the
activities described above or related to the Acquisition. Prior to the Completion Date, the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries will not own, hold or otherwise have any interest in any material assets other than
the Escrow Account, the Escrowed Funds, cash and Cash Equivalents.

Prior to the Completion Date, the Issuer shall not: (i) make any Restricted Payment, except Investments
deemed to exist by virtue of the Escrow Agreement; (ii) Incur any Indebtedness except (A) the Notes,
(B) the New Term Loan B, (C) shareholder loans, (D) Indebtedness that is not secured by a Lien on any
assets, property or Capital Stock owned by the Issuer, the proceeds of which Indebtedness are used solely
for deposit with the Escrow Agent in an amount not to exceed the amount necessary, together with net
proceeds of the issuance of the Notes, to enable the Issuer to make deposits of funds sufficient to pay interest
with respect to the Notes up to, but not including, the latest possible Special Mandatory Redemption Date
based on the then applicable Escrow Longstop Date, and (E) Indebtedness Incurred to consummate the
Acquisition and the Transactions, in each case, in compliance with the covenant below under the caption
"—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock"; (iii) Incur any Liens

_Escrow Release," or (B) in the ordinary course of business or necessary or advisable in connection with, or_
to effectuate, the Acquisition and the other Transactions substantially in accordance with the description of
the Transactions set forth in this Offering Memorandum, together with such amendments, modifications
and waivers to such activities, transactions and agreements that are not, in the aggregate, materially adverse
to the Holders.

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a "Paying Agent") for the Notes which initially
will be Elavon Financial Services DAC.


-----

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a "Registrar") and transfer agents (each, a
"Transfer Agent"). The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of definitive registered
notes outstanding from time to time and will make payments on and facilitate transfer of definitive
registered notes on the behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change the Paying Agents, the Registrars or the transfer agents without prior notice to the
Holders. For so long as the Notes are listed on The International Stock Exchange (the "Exchange") and the
rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change of Paying Agent,
Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in
respect of the Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest coupons, as
follows:

- Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under
the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the "Rule 144A Global Notes").

- Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially
be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(the "Regulation S Global Notes" and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the "Global
**Notes").**

The Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the
common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes ("Book-Entry Interests") will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions
on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under "Notice to
_Investors." In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants_
in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject
to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective
participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the "Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests") may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global
Notes (the "Regulation S Book-Entry Interests") only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Rule
144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor
reasonably believes is a "qualified institutional buyer" within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described
under "Notice to Investors" and in accordance with any applicable securities law of the United States and
any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become
a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such
transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to BookEntry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes representing the Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum
denominations of €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, in each
case upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other
documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions


-----

received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry
Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth
in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to,
and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more
fully under "Notice to Investors."

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, the Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes
may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal
amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange,
the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at
Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any
Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without
charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and Transfer Agent are not required to register the transfer or
exchange of any Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed
in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date applicable
to the Notes; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer (as defined below) or an Asset Sale Offer (as defined below).

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the
Holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantors under
or with respect to any Note Guarantee (as defined below) will be made free and clear of and without
withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes unless the withholding or
deduction of such Taxes is required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any
Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) any jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Guarantor is
incorporated, organized or resident for Tax purposes or (2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment
is made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including the jurisdiction of any Paying Agent)
(each such jurisdiction, or any political subdivision thereof or therein, a "Tax Jurisdiction") is at any time
required to be made from any payments made under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee,
the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay such additional amounts (the "Additional
**Amounts") as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by each**
Holder after such withholding or deduction (including after any such withholding or deduction from
Additional Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have been received by such Holder in
respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding or deduction; _provided, however, that no_
Additional Amounts will be payable with respect to:

(1) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes would not have been imposed but for the existence of any
present or former connection between the relevant Holder or beneficial owner of a Note and the
relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including being a resident of, or engaged in business in, such jurisdiction
for Tax purposes, notably within the meaning of the Luxembourg Relibi law dated 23 December
2005, as amended), other than any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership,
holding or disposition of such Note, the enforcement of rights under such Note or under a Note
Guarantee and/or the receipt of any payments in respect of such Note or a Note Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes would not have been imposed but for the presentation of a Note
for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the date on which such
payment became due and payable or the date on which the relevant payment is first made available


-----

for payment to the Holder, whichever is later (except to the extent that the Holder would have been
entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period);

(3) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer or similar Taxes;

(4) any Taxes imposed as a result of a presentation of a Note (where presentation is required) to a
Paying Agent if the Note could have been presented to another available Paying Agent, and the
presentation that other Paying Agent would not have resulted in withholding or deduction;

(5) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by way of deduction or withholding from payments to
a Holder under, or with respect to, the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee;

(6) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are imposed by reason of the failure of the Holder or beneficial
owner of a Note, after a written request by the applicable withholding agent addressed to the
Holder, to comply with any certification, identification, information or other reporting
requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Tax
Jurisdiction or otherwise needed as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of
deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction or to assess whether such Tax
is applicable to the respective payment (including, without limitation, a certification that the Holder
or beneficial owner is not resident in the Tax Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the
Holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to provide such certification or documentation or
such certification or documentation is otherwise reasonably requested by the Issuer for assessing
whether some exemption or reduction is applicable; or

(7) any combination of items (1) through (6) above.

Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, any amounts to be paid on or with respect to the
Notes or any Note Guarantee by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor will be paid net of any deduction
or withholding imposed or required pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended ("FATCA"), any current or future Treasury Regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder, any law, regulation or other official guidance enacted in any jurisdiction implementing FATCA,
any intergovernmental agreement between the United States and any other jurisdiction to implement
FATCA or any law enacted by such other jurisdiction to give effect to such agreement, or any agreement
with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service under FATCA. Neither the Issuer, any Guarantor or any other
person will be required to pay any additional amounts in respect of FATCA with respect to the Notes or the
Note Guarantees.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership
or person other than the sole beneficial owner of a Note, to the extent that the beneficiary or settlor with
respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been
entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Notes
directly. For a description of the formalities that Holders and beneficial owners must follow in order to
claim an exemption from withholding tax and certain disclosure requirements imposed on the Issuer relating
to the identity and residence of beneficial owners, see "Certain Taxation Considerations" and "Risk
_Factors."_

In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer or relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will also pay and indemnify
the Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, transfer, court or other similar documentary
Taxes which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, issuance, or registration of any
of the Notes, the Indenture, any Note Guarantee or any other document referred to therein, or by any
jurisdiction on the enforcement of any Notes or any Note Guarantee.

If the Issuer or any Guarantor (if it is the applicable withholding agent), as the case may be, becomes aware
that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to
the Notes or any Note Guarantee, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to
the Trustee and Paying Agent on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the
obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to that payment date, in which case the
Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee and Paying Agent promptly thereafter) an Officer's
Certificate stating that Additional Amounts will be payable, the amount estimated to be so payable and any
other information reasonably necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to the


-----

applicable Holders on the relevant payment date. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such Officer's
Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will make all withholdings and deductions required
by law and will remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with
applicable law. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts
from any applicable Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Issuer
or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee (or to a Holder upon written request), within a
reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, an Officer's
Certificate certifying the payment of such Taxes, which Officer's Certificate shall have certified copies of
Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, attached
thereto or if, notwithstanding such entity's efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not available, other
evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) by such entity.

Whenever in the Indenture or in this "Description of the Notes" there is mentioned, in any context, the
payment of principal, interest or any other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes or
any Note Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional
Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect
thereof.

The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer
by a Holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which
any successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is incorporated, organized or resident for Tax purposes
or any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made by or on behalf of such Person on the Notes or
any Note Guarantee and, in each case, any political subdivision thereof or therein.

**Note Guarantees**

**_General_**

Upon the initial issuance of the Notes, the Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer. Within 180 days
following the Control Date, the Notes will also be guaranteed by the Guarantors listed below. Prior to the
Control Date, the Issuer will not control the Target or any of its Subsidiaries, and none of the Target or any
of its Subsidiaries will be subject to the covenants described in this "Description of the Notes." As such, we
cannot assure you that, prior to the Control Date, the Target and its Subsidiaries will not engage in activities
that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such
entities from the Issue Date until the Completion Date. Further, prior to the Control Date, no member of
the Target Group shall be required to guarantee or secure the Notes or any Additional Notes.

Claims by the Trustee or the Security Agent against a Guarantor on behalf of the holders of the Notes will
be direct claims on that Guarantor. The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under
the applicable Note Guarantees to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of
share capital, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, fraudulent conveyance and other legal restrictions


-----

applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. By virtue of
these limitations, a Guarantor's obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts
payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note
Guarantee. In particular, the Note Guarantee of each Guarantor may be limited in value to an amount no
greater than the amount of the proceeds of the Notes (i) directly or indirectly onlent to such Guarantor or
its subsidiaries or (ii) used to refinance directly or indirectly any indebtedness previously incurred which
was onlent to such Guarantor or its subsidiaries, in each case to the extent of the amount so onlent which is
outstanding on the date a payment is to be made under the Note Guarantee of the relevant Guarantor. See
"Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The Note Guarantees and other security interests may be
_limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely affect their_
_validity and enforceability" and "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the_
_Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations."_

The operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries and, therefore, the Issuer depends on
the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. The Notes
and any Note Guarantees will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all indebtedness and other
liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer's non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries. Any right of the Issuer or any Guarantor to receive assets of any of the Issuer's non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries upon that non-Guarantor Subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right
of the Holder of the Notes to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of
that non-Guarantor Subsidiary's creditors. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The Issuer is a
_holding company dependent upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet its obligations on the Notes."_

As of September 30, 2023, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, and assuming that 100% of
the Target's shares are acquired, the Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries (including the Target Group)
would have had €1,835.0 million of senior secured Indebtedness (as well as €500.0 million of availability
under the New Revolving Credit Facility), of which €385.0 million was incurred by the Issuer's nonGuarantor Subsidiaries. See "Capitalization." Although it will constitute a default and an event of default
for the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary to Incur Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock in
excess of the provisions described under "—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance
_of Preferred Stock" such limitations are subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the_
Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiaries of
liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture.
See "—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock."

**_Release of Note Guarantees_**

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically released:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that
Guarantor (including by way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or combination) to a Person
that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or a Subsidiary, if the
sale or other disposition does not violate the "Asset Sale" provisions of the Indenture and the
Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale or other disposition;

(2) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Capital Stock of that Guarantor (including by
way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or combination) to a Person that is not (either before
or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or a Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition
does not violate the "Asset Sale" provisions of the Indenture;

(3) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

(4) upon repayment in full of all obligations of the Issuer and any Guarantors under the Indenture and
the Notes;

(5) upon the liquidation or dissolution of such Guarantor, _provided that no Event of Default has_
occurred and is continuing;

(6) as described under "—Amendments and Waivers";

(7) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;


-----

(8) pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(9) upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event as described under "—Certain Covenants—Suspension
_of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status";_

(10) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as
provided below under the captions "—Defeasance" and "—Satisfaction and Discharge"; or

(11) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such
Guarantor (i) is unconditionally released and discharged from its liability with respect to the 2023
Senior Facilities Agreement, provided that Indebtedness will remain outstanding under the New
Revolving Credit Facility after such release and discharge and (ii) would not otherwise be required
at the time of such release to provide a Note Guarantee under the terms of the Indenture;

Upon the occurrence of any release event described above, the Guarantor to be released shall deliver written
notice of such release to the Trustee. Upon written request and delivery of an Officer's Certificate stating
that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to such release have been complied with,
the Trustee shall execute an acknowledgement of such release.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

Immediately after the issuance of the Notes and upon the occurrence of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer's
Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries.

However, in the circumstances described below under "—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,"
the Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

**Security**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be senior obligations of the Issuer, secured only
by the Escrow Account Charge. Upon receipt by the Trustee of either an Officer's Certificate relating to
Escrow Release or a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption, the Escrowed Funds will be released and
the first-priority security interests over the Escrowed Funds will automatically be released and terminated
and no other Officer's Certificate, Opinion of Counsel, or other document will be required to effect such
release and termination.

On or about the Completion Date, the Notes and the Note Guarantees (as applicable) will (subject to the
Agreed Security Principles) also be secured on a first-ranking basis by:

(a) a Luxembourg law pledge granted by Ephios Subco 2 over shares in the Issuer;

(b) a Luxembourg law pledge over structural intercompany receivables made available by Ephios
Subco 2 to the Issuer (if any); and

(c) a Luxembourg law pledge granted by the Bidder over the custody account in which its Target
shares are held,

(the "Completion Date Collateral").

In the event that the number of shares held by the Bidder does not meet the Squeeze-Out Threshold on or
before the Completion Date, the Notes will also be secured from a date promptly after the Completion Date
until the date on which until the Squeeze-Out Threshold is met, subject to the Agreed Security Principles,
on a first-ranking basis by a pledge granted by the relevant member of the Group (which, as of the date of
this Offering Memorandum, is expected to be a Luxembourg law pledge granted by Ephios Bidco) over the
custody account in which the Target shares owned by such member of the Group are deposited (the "Pre**Squeeze-Out Collateral").**


-----

Within 180 days following (and excluding) the Control Date, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will
(subject to the Agreed Security Principles) also be secured on a first-ranking basis by:

(a) a share pledge over the shares of each Material Subsidiary;

(b) a pledge, assignment or other applicable security over material structural intra-group receivables
owing to the Issuer or the Guarantors (being loans downstreaming the proceeds of the Notes or the
equity contribution into the Group on or around the Completion Date); and

(c) a pledge (without control/notification, prior to enforcement) of the Issuer's material bank accounts,

(the "Post-Completion Collateral" and, together with the Completion Date Collateral and, if applicable,
the Pre-Squeeze-Out Collateral, the "Collateral").

The Collateral will also include any additional security interest that may in the future be granted to secure
obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. The security interests in the Collateral that is created
by the Transaction Security Documents and secures obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and
the Indenture are herein referred to as "Security Interests."

Subject to certain Permitted Collateral Liens, the Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Transaction
Security Documents, directly or via the Security Agent, to the holders of the secured obligations that are
secured by the Collateral, including, on a first-priority basis, the Holders, the lenders under the New
Revolving Credit Facility, the New Term Loan B and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations,
if any. Any proceeds received upon any enforcement of the Collateral would be applied _pro rata_ in
repayment of all obligations under the Notes and any other Indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral
on a pari passu basis. See "Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement" and "—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness."_

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the provisions described under "—Impairment of
_Security Interest" and "—Liens" and the Agreed Security Principles, the Group is permitted to pledge the_
Collateral in connection with future issuances of its Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted
Subsidiaries, including Additional Notes, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.
Any such additional Security Interests that are in the future pledged to secure obligations under the Notes,
any Guarantee and the Indenture will also constitute "Collateral."

The Collateral will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to
fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance under applicable
law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, capital maintenance rules, thin capitalization rules,
retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations
or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law which,
among other things, might limit the amount that can be secured by reference to the net assets and legal
capital of the Issuer and/or any relevant Guarantor. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor's obligation
under the Collateral could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes and the Note
Guarantees, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under the Collateral. For a description of
such contractual limitations, see "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and
_the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations." In addition, and notwithstanding the_
provisions described below under "—Liens," certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and
any pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with
the Agreed Security Principles. Furthermore, Security Interests in the Collateral may be released in
compliance with the Indenture. See "—Release of Liens."

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this offering of the Notes. By its nature,
some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See "Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Notes—The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that_
_will be granted as security for the Notes and future secured indebtedness may be secured by certain assets_
_that do not secure the Notes."_

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the Security Interests in the Collateral among the lenders under the New
Revolving Credit Facility and the New Term Loan B, counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, if


-----

any, secured by the Collateral, the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders is or will be established by
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture and the Transaction Security Documents, which
provide, among other things, that the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Guarantors under
the Note Guarantees, the New Revolving Credit Facility, the New Term Loan B and such Hedging
Obligations will be secured equally and ratably by first-priority Security Interests in the Collateral. See
"Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement" and "—Revolving Credit
_Facility."_

Subject to certain limitations, the Collateral may be pledged to secure future Indebtedness, some of which
may receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral and certain distressed disposals in priority to
the Notes and any Guarantee. See "—Release of Liens," "—Impairment of Security Interest" and "—Certain
_Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens."_

In addition, in connection with the Incurrence of certain Indebtedness that is permitted by the Indenture to
be secured on the Collateral, the Issuer may enter into Additional Intercreditor Agreements in compliance
with the Indenture on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement. See "—Impairment of
_Security Interest" and "—Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be_
_Bound."_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Transaction Security Documents, Ephios Subco 2, the Issuer and the Guarantors will grant
security over the Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Issuer's payment obligations under the
Notes and the Indenture. The Transaction Security Documents will be entered into by, among others, the
relevant security provider and the Security Agent. When entering into the Transaction Security Documents,
the Security Agent will act in its own name but for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, respectively.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Transaction Security Documents
and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by the Security
Interest in the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes, any Note Guarantee and the Indenture have
been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes may be released under certain
circumstances as provided under "—Release of Liens." The validity and enforceability of the Security
Interests will be subject to the limitations described in "Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations."_

In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security
interests, the relevant Transaction Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable, will
provide for the creation of "parallel debt" obligations in favor of the Security Agent, and the security
interests in such jurisdictions will secure the parallel debt (and not the Indebtedness under the Notes, the Note
Guarantees and the other secured obligations). The parallel debt construct has not been tested under law in
certain of these jurisdictions. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—In certain jurisdictions,
_security over the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the_
_Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law" and_
"Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations."_

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce
the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Transaction
Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders under the New Revolving
Credit Facility, the New Term Loan B and counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations. These
limitations are described under "Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement,"
"Description of Other Indebtedness—2023 Term Loan Facilities" and "Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations." The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future_
Indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement.


-----

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) consented and agreed to be bound by the terms of the Transaction Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into in compliance
with the provisions described under "—Additional Intercreditor Agreements" (including, without
limitation, the provisions providing for foreclosure and release of the Note Guarantees and the
Security Interests, including upon an enforcement);

(2) authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, to act on its behalf to enter into the
Transaction Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement entered into in compliance with the provisions described under "—Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements" and to be bound thereby and to perform their respective obligations and_
exercise their respective rights thereunder in accordance therewith; and

(3) appointed and authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to give effect to the provisions in the
Transaction Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
entered into in compliance with the provisions described under "—Additional Intercreditor Agreements."

**_Release of Liens_**

Security Interests over the assets subject to the Escrow Account Charge will be released in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Account Charge.

Security Interests in respect of the Collateral will be released under any one or more of the following
circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to "—Merger and
_Consolidation"), if such sale or other disposition does not violate, the provisions described under_
"—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock" or is otherwise permitted in accordance
with the Indenture or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary, provided that this clause (1)(b) shall not be
relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or of accounts receivable to a Restricted
Subsidiary (other than in connection with a Qualified Securitization Financing) unless the relevant
property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to, a Lien in favor of the Notes
following such sale or disposal;

(2) as described under "—Amendments and Waivers" and "—Liens";

(3) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations under the Indenture and the
Notes or legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes and the
Indenture, as provided in "—Defeasance" and "—Satisfaction and Discharge";

(4) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Issuer) to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property
and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(5) as permitted by the provisions described under "—Impairment of Security Interest" or "—Merger
_and Consolidation";_

(6) upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event as described under "—Certain Covenants—Suspension
_of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status";_

(7) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(8) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor; and


-----

(9) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Transaction Security Documents will be released in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

At the request and expense of the Issuer or the relevant pledgor, the Security Agent and, to the extent
required or necessary, the Trustee will take all reasonably necessary action required to effectuate any release
of Collateral securing the Notes and any Guarantee, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Transaction Security
Document, subject to customary protections and indemnifications, if applicable. Each of the releases set
forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the
part of the Trustee. If requested to take action under this provision, the Trustee or the Security Agent shall
be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer's Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying
which circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of the Security has occurred, and that such
release complies with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

**IPO Debt Pushdown**

The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) will provide (and
the Indenture and the Notes shall be subject to such provisions) that, on, in contemplation of, or following
an Initial Public Offering, the Issuer or its successor shall be entitled to require (by written notice to, among
others, the Trustee and the Security Agent) that the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and the Transaction Security Documents (as applicable) shall
operate (with effect from the date specified in such notice) as described under "Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement—Provisions Following an IPO." The Trustee and the Security_
Agent shall be required (at the expense of the Issuer) to enter into any amendment to the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and/or the Transaction Security
Documents required by the Issuer and/or take such other action as is required by the Issuer in order to
facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by this paragraph, including releasing security and
guarantees, provided that any such amendment or action will not impose any personal obligations on the
Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable,
adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee or Security
Agent under such amendment or action. The Trustee and the Security Agent are each irrevocably authorized
and instructed by the Holders of the Notes (without any further consent by the Holders of the Notes) to
execute any such amended, released or replacement documents and/or take such other action on behalf of
the Holders (and shall do so at the request of the Issuer).

**Mandatory Redemption**

Except as described under the caption "—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption," the Issuer
is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes.

**Optional Redemption**

The Notes will be redeemable on any one or more occasions, at the Issuer's option, at any time prior to
maturity at varying redemption prices, upon not less than ten nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the
Holders with a copy to the Trustee and Paying Agent in accordance with the provisions set forth below.

The Notes will be redeemable, at the Issuer's option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time
on and after           , 2026 and prior to maturity at the following redemption prices (expressed as a
percentage of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but
not including the relevant redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month
period commencing on            of the years set forth below:

**Redemption**

In addition, the Indenture provides that at any time and from time to time on or prior to         , 2026,
the Notes will be redeemable at the Issuer's option, in an aggregate principal amount equal to up to 40% of
the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional
Notes) with funds in an equal aggregate amount not exceeding the aggregate proceeds of one or more
Qualified Equity Offerings (as defined below), at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal
amount thereof) of         %, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but
not including the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided that:

(a) redemption occurs within 180 days after the date of the closing of such Qualified Equity Offering;
and

(b) an aggregate principal amount of Notes equal to at least 50% of the original aggregate principal
amount of the Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional Notes) must remain
outstanding after each such redemption of Notes.

Prior to          , 2026, the Issuer may redeem during each twelve-month period commencing with the
Issue Date up to 10% of the original principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount
of any Additional Notes) at its option, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice, at a redemption
price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

In addition, at any time prior to           , 2026, the Notes may be redeemed or purchased (by the
Issuer or any other Person) in whole or in part, at the Issuer's option, at a price (the "Redemption Price")
equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium (as defined below) as of, and
accrued but unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption
or purchase (the "Redemption Date") (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date
to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

For purposes of the foregoing discussion, the following definitions apply:

"Applicable Premium" means, with respect to a Note the greater of (i) 1.0% of the principal amount of
such Note and (ii) with respect to any Note at any Redemption Date:

(a) the excess of:

(i) the present value at such Redemption Date of (1) the redemption price of such Note
on          , 2025 (such redemption price being that described in the second paragraph
of this "Optional Redemption" section) plus (2) all required remaining scheduled interest
payments due on such Note from the Redemption Date through such date, computed using
a discount rate equal to the Bund Rate (as defined below) plus 50 basis points, over

(ii) the principal amount of such Note on such Redemption Date, in each case as calculated
by the Issuer or on behalf of the Issuer by such Person as the Issuer shall designate;
_provided that such calculation shall not be a duty or obligation of the Trustee or the Paying_
Agent and neither the Trustee nor the Paying Agent shall have the obligation to verify the
accuracy of such Applicable Premium.

For the avoidance of doubt, calculation of the Applicable Premium shall not be the responsibility of the
Trustee, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar.

"Bund Rate" means, with respect to a Redemption Date, the yield to maturity at the time of computation
of German Bundesanleihe securities selected by any Reference German Bund Dealer as having a fixed
maturity most nearly equal to the period from such Redemption Date to         , 2026, and that would
be utilized at the time of selection, and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new
issues of euro-denominated corporate debt securities in a principal amount approximately equal to the then
outstanding principal amount of the Notes and of a maturity most nearly equal to           , 2026;
_provided, however, that if the period from the Redemption Date to such date is not equal to the constant_
maturity of a German Bundesanleihe security selected by such Reference German Bund Dealer, the Bund
Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the
weekly average yields of German Bundesanleihe securities for which such yields are given, except that if


-----

the period from the Redemption Date to such date is less than one year, a fixed maturity of one year shall
be used. "Reference German Bund Dealer" means any dealer of German Bundesanleihe securities appointed
by the Issuer.

"Qualified Equity Offering" means any issuance of Capital Stock after the Issue Date (other than
Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer, or options, warrants or rights with respect to its Capital Stock, pursuant
to (i) a public offering in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations or (ii) a private offering in
accordance with Regulation S or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

**_General_**

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes
or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date. If the optional redemption date
is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and
unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on
such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to holders of Notes whose Notes are subject to
redemption by the Issuer.

Any redemption and/or notice of redemption may, at the Issuer's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of
one or more conditions precedent (including, in the case of a redemption related to an Equity Offering, the
consummation of such Equity Offering). In addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction
of one or more conditions precedent, such notice may state that, in the Issuer's discretion, the redemption
date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (provided, however,
_that, in any case, such redemption date shall be no more than 60 days from the date on which such notice_
is first given), or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or
all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so
delayed. Notwithstanding anything else in the Indenture or the Notes to the contrary, redemption notices
may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a
defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes (including any Change of
Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer (each, as defined below)), if holders of Notes of not less than 90% in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such
tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all
of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have
the right upon not less than ten nor more than 60 days' prior notice, given not more than 30 days following
such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal
to the price offered to each other holder of Notes in such tender offer plus, to the extent not included in the
tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

The Issuer or its affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes. Any such purchases may
be made through open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or
more tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as well as with such
consideration as the Issuer or any such affiliates may determine.

**_Redemption for Changes in Taxes_**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at its option upon giving not less than ten nor
more than 60 days' prior notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable and given in accordance
with the procedures described in "—Selection and Notice"), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed by
the Issuer for redemption (a "Tax Redemption Date") and all Additional Amounts (if any) then due or that
will become due on or before the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject
to the right of Holders on any record date occurring prior to the Tax Redemption Date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof) if, as a result
of (i) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction, which change or amendment is officially announced and
becomes effective on or after the date of this Offering Memorandum (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction
became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the date of this Offering Memorandum, such later date), or (ii)
any amendment to, or change in, an official written interpretation, administration or application of such
laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment, order by a court of


-----

competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) which amendment or change is
officially announced and becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction
Offering Memorandum became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the date of this Offering Memorandum,
such later date), on a future date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes, the Issuer
or any Guarantor is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts, and the Issuer or Guarantor cannot
avoid such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available to them.

The Issuer will not give notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the
obligation to pay Additional Amounts would arise were a payment then due. Prior to the publication or,
where relevant, delivery of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will
deliver to the Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel or tax advisors of recognized expertise in the
laws of the relevant jurisdiction and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee to the effect that there has been
such amendment or change which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the Notes hereunder. In addition,
before the Issuer publishes or sends notice of redemption of the Notes as described above, it will deliver to
the Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be
avoided by the Issuer or Guarantor taking reasonable measures available to them and stating that it is
entitled to effect such redemption and showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have
been satisfied.

The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Officer's Certificate and opinion
of independent tax counsel as sufficient evidence of the existence and satisfaction of the conditions
precedent as described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and
binding on the Holders. Any Notes that are redeemed will be cancelled.

**Change of Control**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control with respect to the Notes, unless the Issuer (or another person
on behalf of the Issuer) has exercised its right to redeem the Notes as described under "—Optional
_Redemption," each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or a portion (equal to_
€100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Notes pursuant to the offer
described below (the "Change of Control Offer"), at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control
**Payment"), subject to the rights of Holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant**
interest payment date.

Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of Control occurs, unless the Issuer has exercised
its right to redeem the Notes as described under "—Optional Redemption," with respect to the Notes, prior
to any Change of Control but after the public announcement of the pending Change of Control, the Issuer
will be required to send, by mail (or otherwise deliver in accordance with the applicable rules and
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream), a notice to each Holder of Notes, with a copy to the Trustee and
Paying Agent, which notice will govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer. Such notice will state,
among other things, the purchase date, which must be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from
the date such notice is mailed (or otherwise deliver in accordance with the applicable rules and procedures
of Euroclear and Clearstream), other than as may be required by law (the "Change of Control Payment
**Date"). The notice, if mailed (or otherwise delivered in accordance with the applicable rules and procedures**
of Euroclear and Clearstream) prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, will state that
the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control being consummated on or prior to the
Change of Control Payment Date.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, (1) accept or cause a third
party to accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer; (2) deposit or cause a third party to deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the
Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and (3) deliver
or cause to be delivered to the Registrar the Notes accepted together with an Officer's Certificate (with a
copy to the Trustee) stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being repurchased.

The Paying Agent will promptly, at the cost of the Issuer, deliver to each Holder of Notes properly tendered
the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Issuer will promptly issue, and upon delivery of an
authentication order from the Issuer, the authentication agent will promptly authenticate and send (or cause
to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased
portion of the Notes surrendered, if any.


-----

The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions
of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the
Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require the Issuer to repurchase or redeem
the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer with respect to the Notes if a third party
makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for such
an offer made by the Issuer and such third party purchases all the Notes properly tendered and not
withdrawn under its offer or notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described
above under the caption "—Optional Redemption."

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in
advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (by the Issuer, or
a third party as contemplated by the immediately preceding paragraph), if a definitive agreement is in place
for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

Notes repurchased by the Issuer pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will have the status of Notes issued
but not outstanding or will be retired and cancelled at the option of the Issuer. Notes purchased by a third
party pursuant to the preceding paragraph will have the status of Notes issued and outstanding.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and
do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change
of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and
not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than ten nor
more than 60 days' prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such
purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date.

The Issuer will comply in all material respects with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are
applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control. To the extent
that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations applicable to us conflict with the Change of
Control Offer provisions of the Notes, the Issuer will comply with those securities laws and regulations and
will not be deemed to have breached our obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions of the
Notes by virtue of any such conflict.

In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited, by the terms of any
indebtedness, from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer may seek the consent of the holders of such
indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such
prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such a consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer would remain
prohibited from purchasing the Notes.

In such case, the Issuer's failure to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the
Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, the Indenture will provide that the Issuer's failure to offer to purchase
the Notes would constitute a default under clause (iv) and not clause (i) under the caption "—Events of
_Default." Indebtedness incurred in the future may contain prohibitions on the occurrence of certain events_
that would constitute a Change of Control or require the repurchase of such indebtedness upon a Change
of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of Notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase
their Notes could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not, due
to the financial effect of such repurchase on us. Finally, the ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes
following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Issuer's then existing financial
resources. We cannot assure you that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—We may not be able to obtain the funds
_required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control."_

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the
Issuer will release a notice of any Change of Control through the Exchange (with a copy to the Trustee and
Paying Agent) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official
website of the Exchange (www.tisegroup.com).


-----

For purposes of the foregoing discussion of a Change of Control Offer, the following definitions are
applicable:

"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following:

(1) the Issuer becomes aware (by way of a report or any other filing pursuant to Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act, proxy, vote, written notice or otherwise) of any "person" or "group" of related
persons (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act as in effect on the
Issue Date), other than one or more Permitted Holders, being or becoming the "beneficial owner"
(as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date) of more than 50% of
the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Issuer provided that no Change of Control shall
be deemed to occur by reason of the Issuer (or any Successor Issuer) becoming a Subsidiary of a
Successor Parent and any Voting Stock of which any Permitted Holder is the "beneficial owner"
(as so defined) shall not be included in any Voting Stock of which any such person or group is the
"beneficial owner" (as so defined), unless that person or group is not an Affiliate of a Permitted
Holder and has greater voting power with respect to that Voting Stock;

(2) Ephios Subco 2 (or any successor entity as a result of a merger of Ephios Subco 2 permitted by the
Indenture) ceasing to directly own 100% of the total issued share capital of the Issuer (or any
successor entity as a result of a merger of the Issuer permitted by the Indenture); or

(3) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger,
amalgamation, consolidation or other business combination transaction), in one or a series of
related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Group taken as a whole to a
person, other than a Restricted Subsidiary or one or more Permitted Holders,

_provided that_ notwithstanding the foregoing:

(1) a transaction will not be deemed to involve a Change of Control solely as a result of the Issuer
becoming an indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of a Holding Company if:

(a) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such Holding Company immediately
following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Issuer's Voting
Stock immediately prior to that transaction; or

(b) immediately following that transaction no person (other than a Holding Company
satisfying the requirements of (1) above) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of
more than 50% of the Voting Stock of such Holding Company;

(2) the right to acquire Voting Stock (so long as such person does not have the right to direct the voting
of the Voting Stock subject to such right) or any veto power in connection with the acquisition or
disposition of Voting Stock will not be deemed to cause a party to be a beneficial owner;

(3) for the avoidance of doubt, a Permitted Specified Asset Disposition shall not constitute a Change
of Control; and

(4) a Permitted Transaction under paragraph (a), (d) or (h) of the definition thereof shall not constitute
a Change of Control.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change of Control shall not be deemed to have occurred if such Change
of Control is also a Specified Change of Control.

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition of "all or substantially all" of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase
"substantially all," there is no precise, established definition of the phrase under applicable law.
Accordingly, the applicability of the requirement that the Issuer offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of
a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another person or group may be uncertain. In addition, if an event
constitutes a Change of Control, the definitions of Change of Control and Permitted Holders expressly
permit a third party to obtain control of the Issuer in a transaction that is a Specified Change of Control
Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer.


-----

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or Registrar will select Notes
for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which
the Notes are listed or, if the Notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis or by pool factor or such other
method as the Paying Agent and Registrar deems to be fair and appropriate (or, in the case of Notes issued
in global form as discussed under "Book-Entry, Delivery and Form," based on the applicable procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream), unless otherwise required by applicable law or depositary requirements. None
of the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Registrar shall be liable for selections made in accordance with this
paragraph.

No Notes of €100,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class
mail (or otherwise delivered in accordance with the rules and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream) at
least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at
its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a
redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture. The Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and
the performance of the Issuer's obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another
Person. Any such redemption and notice may, in the Issuer's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one
or more conditions precedent, including but not limited to the occurrence of a Change of Control.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the
portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal
to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the holder of Notes upon
cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such
Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion. Notes called
for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest
ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, any such
notice to the holders of the Notes shall also be released through the Exchange or, to the extent and in the
manner permitted by such rules, posted on the official website of the Exchange (www.tisegroup.com) and,
in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change in the principal
amount of Notes outstanding.

**Certain Covenants**

The Indenture will contain certain covenants including, among others, the following:

**_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
and the Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, issue any
Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred
stock, _provided, however, that_ the Issuer may Incur Indebtedness or issue Disqualified Stock, and the
Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Indebtedness, issue Disqualified Stock or issue preferred stock, if, on the
Applicable Test Date and after giving _pro forma effect thereto (including_ _pro forma application of the_
proceeds thereof), either:

(a) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio either does not decrease as a result or is at least 2.00:1; or

(b) the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio either does not increase as a result or does not exceed 5.50:1.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of any of the following items of
Indebtedness (collectively, "Permitted Indebtedness"):

(1) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under any Credit
Facility (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit, guarantees and bankers' acceptances
thereunder) in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding under this clause (1) not to
exceed the sum of:

Date; plus

(b) an amount equal to the greater of (x) €480 million and (y) 100% of Consolidated EBITDA;
_plus_

(c) the maximum amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness such that, on the Applicable Test
Date after giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence, the Consolidated Senior Secured
Leverage Ratio does not exceed 3.50:1; plus

(d) the maximum amount of Indebtedness secured on the Collateral under the Intercreditor
Agreement that is not Senior Secured Indebtedness such that, on the Applicable Test Date
after giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence, either:

(i) the Consolidated Total Secured Leverage Ratio either does not increase as a result
or does not exceed 4.50:1; or

(ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio either does not decrease as a result or is at least
2.00:1; plus

(e) the maximum amount of Indebtedness not secured on Collateral under the Intercreditor
Agreement or unsecured such that on the Applicable Test Date, after giving pro forma
effect to such Incurrence, either:

(i) the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio either does not increase as a result or does
not exceed 5.50:1; or

(ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio either does not decrease as a result or is at least
2.00:1,

_provided that_ any Indebtedness or unutilized commitments in respect of Indebtedness Incurred or
deemed to be Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) may be refinanced at any time if such refinancing
does not exceed the greater of (a) the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness permitted to be
Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) on the Applicable Test Date for such refinancing and (b) the
aggregate principal amount of the Indebtedness or unutilized commitments in respect of
Indebtedness being refinanced at such time (together with an amount necessary to pay accrued and
unpaid interest and any fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar
fees), including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other
costs and expenses Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing) and, in the case of a
refinancing of Indebtedness under the New Term Loan B Incurred as at the Completion Date, such
Indebtedness shall be treated for all purposes as Incurred pursuant to clause (a)((ii) above;

(2) any (a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other obligations
of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary provided that if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and any guarantee of the Notes under the Finance
Documents, then the guarantee must be subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and any
guarantee of the Notes under the Finance Documents to the same extent as the Indebtedness
guaranteed and (b) without limiting the covenant set out in "—Liens," Indebtedness arising by
reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such person securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness or other
obligations is permitted by the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;


-----

(4) Indebtedness represented by:

(a) Indebtedness of the Target and its Subsidiaries outstanding as of the Completion Date or
Incurred under a facility committed and as in effect as of the Completion Date; and

(b) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of:

(i) any Indebtedness described in paragraph (a) above; or

(ii) any Permitted Indebtedness; or

(c) other Indebtedness Incurred to finance Management Advances;

(5) Indebtedness (x) of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any person that will be a Restricted
Subsidiary or that will be merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred or issued to finance an acquisition (including an acquisition of
any assets), merger, amalgamation or consolidation or any capital expenditure or (y) of persons
that are, or secured by any assets that are, acquired by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or
merged into, amalgamated or consolidated with the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture; in an aggregate amount not to exceed:

(a) an amount which, when taken together with any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in
respect thereof and the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this
clause (5)(a) and then outstanding, does not exceed the greater of (i) €120 million and
(ii) 25% of Consolidated EBITDA as of the Applicable Test Date; plus

(b) unlimited additional Indebtedness to the extent that:

(i) after giving effect to such acquisition, capital expenditure, merger, amalgamation
or consolidation, either:

(A) if such Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, either (x) the Issuer
would be permitted to Incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness
pursuant to clause (1)(c) above; or (y) the Consolidated Senior Secured
Leverage Ratio would not increase as a result;

(B) if such Indebtedness constitutes Indebtedness that is secured on the

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this Section 2:

(1) subject to sub-paragraph (ii) below, and without prejudice to the eighteenth and nineteenth
paragraphs of "—Financial Calculations," in the event that all or any portion of any item of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of
more than one of the categories of Permitted Indebtedness or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to
the first paragraph, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time
reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include, in any manner that complies
with this "—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock," the amount and type of
such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock (or any portion thereof) in one or more of
the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant, and Indebtedness
permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting
such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more
other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(2) all Indebtedness under the Notes and the New Term Loan B as of the Completion Date (and any
Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof), shall be deemed to have been Incurred
pursuant to clause (1)(a)(ii) above and the Issuer shall not be permitted to reclassify all or a portion
of such Indebtedness;

(3) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred
under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to a "cash sweep" or
"clean down" provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that
Indebtedness is deemed to have been repaid periodically shall only be deemed for the purposes of
this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on
the date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(4) in the case of any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount
of such Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay the aggregate
amount of accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses (including original issue discount,


-----

upfront fees or similar fees), including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees,
discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred or payable in connection with such
refinancing;

(5) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(6) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to first or second
paragraphs above and the letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments relate
to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(7) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or preferred
stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory
redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase
premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(8) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under
any facility or enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness, the Incurrence or
issuance thereof for all purposes under the Indenture, including for the purposes of calculating any
Applicable Metric for borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and including issuance and
creation of letters of credit and bankers' acceptances thereunder) may be determined, at the Issuer's
option (A) on the date of such facility or such entry into or increase in commitments or (B) on the
date on which such facility or commitments become available or, if applicable, any other
Applicable Test Date (assuming, in the case of (A) and (B) of this clause (8) that the full amount
thereof (or, at the option of the Issuer, a portion thereof) has been borrowed as of such date and, in
either case, if any such Applicable Metric is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any
borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers'
acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Applicable Metric
at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers'
acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount (excluding any such amount in respect of
Indebtedness under any revolving facility, letter of credit facility or bank guarantee facility and/or
other debt which is available to be re-drawn) permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed on a date
pursuant to the operation of this clause (8) but not actually borrowed on such date shall be the
"Reserved Indebtedness Amount" as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Leverage
Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, to the extent of any clause of
the second paragraph above (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such
sub-paragraphs);

(9) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred
to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on one or more of the clauses of the second
paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of
Consolidated EBITDA as of an Applicable Test Date, if such refinancing would cause the
percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the
percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the Applicable Test Date of such refinancing, such
percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as
such Indebtedness is Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; and

(10) except as otherwise specified herein, the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than
the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof
determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual and/or capitalization of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion
or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness,
the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares or preferred stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not
be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this covenant;
_provided that_ the amount of any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding
Indebtedness may (in the Issuer's sole discretion) be increased by the amount of all such accrued and/or


-----

capitalized interest, accreted value, original issue discount and/or additional Indebtedness in respect of such
Indebtedness and such increased amount will not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the purpose of
calculating any basket, permission or threshold under which such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness is
permitted to be Incurred.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant, the Issuer shall be in
default of this covenant).

For the purposes of determining compliance with any euro denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the euro equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall
be calculated as described in "—Financial Calculations," provided that if such determination is made with
respect to Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and
such refinancing would cause the applicable euro denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at
the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro denominated
restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as such Indebtedness is Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness.

the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such
Restricted Payment had been made at the beginning of the Relevant Testing Period, have
been permitted to incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of "—Incurrence of

deemed to be €0); plus

Permitted Investment, the Issuer will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or

of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner that
complies with this covenant, including as a Permitted Investment.

purchase or otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Parent Entity or any of the
Issuer's Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any Parent Entity
and to Affiliates thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a "direct or
_indirect" action by the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries._

**_Liens_**

The Issuer will not and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien (the "Initial Lien")
of any kind securing Indebtedness upon any of their property or assets, now owned or hereafter acquired,
except: (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (i) Permitted Liens or
(ii) unless all payments due under the Indenture are secured on an equal and ratable basis with the
Indebtedness so secured until such time as such Indebtedness is no longer secured by a Lien (and if such
Indebtedness so secured is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and any guarantee of Notes under
the Finance Documents, on a senior priority basis); and (b) in the case of any property or asset that
constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to this "—Liens" will provide by its terms that
such Lien will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and
discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates and (ii) otherwise as set forth in the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and/or under the relevant Transaction Security Document.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount
of such Indebtedness. The "Increased Amount" of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount


-----

of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with
the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount
of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases
in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
create or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of
any Restricted Subsidiary to:

Subsidiary, or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or
pay any Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) make loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,
_provided that (x) the priority of any preferred stock in receiving dividends or liquidating_
distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y)
the subordination of (including the application of any standstill period to) loans or advances made
to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness incurred by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or
restriction.

reason of:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to or arising from (a) any Credit Facility (including the
New Term Loan B and the New Revolving Credit Facility), (b) the Intercreditor Agreement or any

any other Restricted Subsidiary, or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer
or any other Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital
Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration for, or to provide all or any portion of the funds
utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated
or otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in
connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, if another Person
is the resulting, surviving or transferee Person following such merger, consolidation or
combination (the "Successor Issuer"), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such
Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Issuer or any other
Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Issuer;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument
referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an "Initial Agreement") or
contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in
clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that (a) the encumbrances
and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or
instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which
such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good

set forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any other
Restricted Subsidiary; or

(a) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument, taken
as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the Holders of the Notes than (i) the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement, together
with the security documents associated therewith, and the Intercreditor Agreement, in each
case, as in effect on the Issue Date, or (ii) is customary in comparable financings (as
determined in good faith by the Issuer's Board of Directors), or

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
consummate an Asset Sale unless:

(1) the Issuer (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration (including by
way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent
or otherwise) at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or
Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale (excluding any consideration by way
of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or

cash or Cash Equivalents. For purposes of this clause (2), each of the following will be deemed to

and its Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer obligated with respect to such liabilities or
are indemnified against further liabilities;

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of the

paragraph of this covenant;

(d) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Sales having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with
all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (2)(d) that

Consolidated EBITDA at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash
Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent
changes in value); provided that the value ascribed to any operating contracts entered into


-----

in connection with a sale of a business shall be Designated Non-Cash Consideration and
shall not reduce the foregoing;

(e) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a
result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary
are released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale;
and

(f) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received from
Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary.

Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Issuer (or the applicable
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may:

(1) apply such Net Proceeds (at the option of the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary):

(a) to prepay, repay or purchase Senior Secured Indebtedness and to correspondingly reduce
commitments with respect thereto (except in the case of any revolving Indebtedness);

(b) to purchase or prepay or redeem or repay (i) any Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on
assets or property which do not constitute Collateral or (ii) any Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary);

(c) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Permitted
Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted
Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(e) to acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock) not classified as current assets under
IFRS that are used or useful in a Permitted Business; or

(f) any combination of the foregoing;

(2) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Proceeds pursuant to clauses (1)(b), (1)(c), (1)(d)
or (1)(e) above; provided that such binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application
of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which
such acquisition or expenditure is consummated, and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of
the aforementioned 450-day period,

_provided that to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to prepay, repay or purchase_
any Indebtedness referred to in sub-paragraphs (i)(A) and (i)(B) above, to the extent the creditors in respect
of such Indebtedness elect not to tender their Indebtedness, the Issuer will be deemed to have applied an
amount of Net Proceeds equal to such amount not so tendered, and such amount shall not increase the
amount of Excess Proceeds (such amount, together with the aggregate amount described under the last two
sentences of paragraph (d) below, the "Declined Proceeds").

Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Issuer (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may
temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any manner that is
not prohibited by the Indenture. The Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may elect to apply Net Proceeds in
accordance with clauses (1)(a) through (1)(f) of the second paragraph of this covenant above prior to
receiving such Net Proceeds.

Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph
above hereof shall constitute "Excess Proceeds" provided that, if at the time of any definitive agreement,
put option or similar arrangement in respect of any Asset Sale or (at the option of the Issuer) the date on
which Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale is received, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries is no greater than 4.00:1, 50% of the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale
shall be deemed not to constitute Excess Proceeds and may be used by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. On the 451st day after an Asset Sale, or at
such earlier date that the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of


-----

€100 million and 20% of Consolidated EBITDA the Issuer shall make an offer (an "Asset Sale Offer") to
the Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to any holders of Senior Secured Indebtedness as the Issuer
elects, to purchase, prepay or redeem the maximum principal amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness (plus
all accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the amount of all fees and expenses, including premiums,
incurred in connection therewith) that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed out of the Excess Proceeds.
The offer price for the Notes in any Asset Sale Offer shall be equal to 100 % of the principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of purchase, prepayment or
redemption, subject to the rights of the Holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date and shall be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after
consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not
otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess
Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

The Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may make an Asset Sale Offer prior to the
expiration of the 450-day period mentioned in the second paragraph above.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any
person, unless:

(1) either: (a) the Issuer is the surviving corporation; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance, lease or other disposition has been made is an entity organized or existing under the
laws of Germany, England and Wales, Luxembourg or any state of the United States or the District
of Columbia;

(2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger with the Issuer (if other than
the Issuer) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other
disposition has been made assumes all the obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists;

(4) the Issuer or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the
Issuer), or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been
made would, on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related
financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter
period (i) be permitted to incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in clause (a) of the first paragraph of "—Incurrence of
_Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" or (ii) have a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio no less_
than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, in each case,
stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer complies with this covenant; provided that in
giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer's Certificate as to any matters of
fact, including as to satisfaction of (3) and (4) above.

A Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose guarantee obligations under the Finance Documents are to be
released in accordance with the terms of the Indenture) will not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or
merge with or into another Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving corporation); or (2) sell,
assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of
such Guarantor and its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more
related transactions, to another Person, unless:

(1) immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Event of Default exists; and

(2) either:

(a) the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by
or surviving any such consolidation or merger assumes all the obligations of that


-----

Guarantor under its guarantee obligations under the Finance Documents, the Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction Security Documents to which such
Guarantor is a party pursuant to an accession agreement, Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and appropriate Transaction Security Documents reasonably satisfactory to the
Security Agent; or

(b) the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture.

In the event of any transaction (other than a lease) described in and complying with the conditions listed in
the preceding paragraph of this covenant in which a Guarantor is not the continuing corporation, the
successor Person formed or remaining or to which such transfer is made shall succeed to, and be substituted
for, and may exercise every right and power of the Guarantor and the Guarantor will be discharged from
all obligations and covenants under the Finance Documents to which such Guarantor is a party.

Clauses (3) and (4) of the first paragraph and (1) of the second paragraph above will not apply to (a) any
sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets or merger or consolidation of any Restricted
Subsidiary (including any Guarantor) with or into any Guarantor or the Issuer or (b) any sale or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets or merger or consolidation of the Issuer with or into any
other Guarantor. Clauses (1) and (2)(b) of the second paragraph above will not apply to any sale or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets or merger or consolidation of the Guarantor with or into
any other Guarantor. Clause (4) of the first paragraph above will not apply to any sale or other disposition
of all or substantially all of the assets or merger or consolidation of the Issuer or any Guarantor with or into
an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer or such Guarantor in another jurisdiction
for tax reasons. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, any Guarantor may consolidate or
otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Guarantor.

Nothing in this covenant shall prohibit any Permitted Transaction.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to
or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or
assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan,
advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer (each, an "Affiliate Transaction")
involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of the greater of €20 million and 5% of
Consolidated EBITDA, unless:

(1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that could have been obtained in a comparable transaction
(at the time of such Affiliate Transaction) by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with a Person
who is not an Affiliate; and

(2) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving an
aggregate consideration in excess of the greater of €50 million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA,
the Issuer delivers to the Trustee evidence that the terms of such transaction or series of related
transactions have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the
Issuer.

The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to
the provisions of the prior paragraph:

arrangements with any employee, consultant, officer or director of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, including under any stock option, stock appreciation rights, stock incentive or similar
plans;

(in each case other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Issuer) that is an Affiliate or Associate,

Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or
otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(4) payment of reasonable fees and reimbursements of expenses to, and customary indemnities

and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture that are fair to the Issuer or the
Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the members of the Board of Directors
of the Issuer or an Officer thereof, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have
been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated Person;

(12) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any arrangements,
payments or other transactions pursuant to which the Issuer and any other Person or a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer and any other Person with which the Issuer or any of its Restricted

as holders of Indebtedness or preferred Equity Interests of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, so
long as such transaction is with all holders of such class (and there are such non-Affiliate holders)

(19) any transaction effected as a part of a Receivables Financing, CIR Financing and factoring or
similar arrangements;

(20) any:

(a) payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

Ephios Subco 2 will not and the Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action which action or omission would
have the result of materially impairing the security interests with respect to the Collateral (it being
understood that the incurrence of Liens on the Collateral permitted by the definition of Permitted Collateral
Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interests with respect to the
Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, and Ephios Subco 2 will not and the
Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person other
than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and the other
beneficiaries described in the Transaction Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement any interest
whatsoever in any of the Collateral; provided that (a) the Collateral may be discharged and released in
accordance with the Indenture, the Transaction Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (b) Ephios Subco 2, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may
incur Permitted Collateral Liens; (c) Ephios Subco 2, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may
undertake a Permitted Reorganization; (d) the applicable Transaction Security Documents may be
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced, or released
(followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets); and
(e) Ephios Subco 2, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may amend the Transaction Security
Documents in any manner that does not adversely affect the holders of the Notes in any material respect;
_provided, however, that in the case if clause (a), (c) and (d) above, except with respect to any discharge or_
release in accordance with the Indenture, any Transaction Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or any action not prohibited by the applicable Transaction
Security Document, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
the Transaction Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified, replaced, or released, unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension,
replacement, restatement, supplement, modification, renewal or release (followed by an immediate retaking
of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the assets), the Issuer delivers to the Trustee either: (1) a
solvency opinion from an investment bank or accounting firm, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, supplement, modification,
replacement or release, (2) a certificate from the board of directors or an Officer of the relevant Person
amending, extending, renewing, restating, supplementing, modifying, replacing or releasing and retaking
such Transaction Security Document which confirms the solvency of such Person after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or
release and retaking and replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications), confirming that, after giving
effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
modification, replacement or release, the Lien or Liens securing the Notes created under the Transaction
Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are
valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in
equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and
retaking.

At the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the holders of Notes, the Security Agent may from
time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Transaction Security Documents to: (i) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein, (ii) (but subject to compliance with the immediately
preceding paragraph) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens, (iii) add to the Collateral, (iv) comply with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (v) evidence the
succession of another Person to the Issuer or a Guarantor and the assumption by such successor of the
obligations under the Indenture, the Notes, the applicable Note Guarantee and the Transaction Security
Documents, in each case, in accordance with the covenant described under the caption "—Merger and
_Consolidation," (vi) provide for the release of property and assets constituting Collateral from the Liens of_
the Transaction Security Documents or the release of the Note Guarantee of a Guarantor, in each case, if
not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture, (vii) conform the Transaction Security Documents to this
"Description of the Notes," (viii) evidence and provide for the acceptance of the appointment of a successor
Trustee or Security Agent, (ix) (but subject to compliance with the immediately preceding paragraph) to

-----

immediately preceding paragraph) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the rights
of the holders of the Notes in any material respect.

In the event that the Issuer complies with this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject
to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release with no need for instructions from holders
of the Notes.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee:

(1) within 150 days after the end of the Accounting Period ending December 31, 2024 and within 120
days after the end of each subsequent Accounting Period, (i) an operating and financial review of
the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial
condition and liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion of material commitments and
contingencies and critical accounting policies, (ii) pro forma income statement and balance sheet
information of the Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions,
dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently
completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates (other than the Acquisition) (unless
such pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3)
below); provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent
available without unreasonable expense, in which case, the Issuer will provide, in the case of a
material acquisition, acquired company financials, (iii) a description of the business, management
and shareholders of the Issuer, all material affiliate transactions and a description of all material
contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments (unless such contractual
arrangements were described in a previous annual or semi-annual report, in which case the Issuer
need describe only any material changes), (iv) material risk factors relating to the business of the
Issuer and material recent developments and (v) audited consolidated statements of income,
statements of cash flow and balance sheets of the Issuer prepared in accordance with IFRS or U.S.
GAAP as of and for the most recent two fiscal years (including appropriate footnotes and the report
of the independent auditors on such financial statements);

(2) within 60 days (or in respect of the first two complete financial quarters ending after the
Completion Date, 75 days) after the end of each of the first three financial quarters in any financial
year, an interim report including (i) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the
end of such semi-annual period and an unaudited condensed statement of income and statement of
cash flow for the period from the beginning of the then-current fiscal year until the end of such
semi-annual period, and the comparable prior year periods (together with condensed footnote
disclosure) prepared in accordance with IFRS or U.S. GAAP, (ii) pro forma income statement and
balance sheet information of the Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material
acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most
recently completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly report relates; provided that such pro
_forma_ financial information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable
expense, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired
company financials; (iii) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements,
including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital
resources and (iv) material recent developments; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any
acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction (other than the Acquisition)
that is material to the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a senior executive
officer or director changes at the Issuer or a change in auditors of the Issuer, a report containing a
description of such event;

_provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2), and (3) above will not be required to (i)_
contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles of any financial information
prepared in accordance with IFRS or (ii) include separate financial statements for any Guarantors or nonguarantor Subsidiaries of the Issuer; provided, further, however, that any reports set out in this paragraph
posted on the Issuer's website or delivered to the Trustee via email in PDF format or other electronic means
shall be deemed to have been "furnished" to the Trustee in accordance with the terms of this paragraph.


-----

All financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS or U.S. GAAP. Except as provided for
above, no report need include separate financial statements for the Issuer or Subsidiaries of the Issuer or
any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of
a type included in this Offering Memorandum.

At any time that any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, would (if it were restricted) constitute
a Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the
first paragraph of this "—Reports" covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the
face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of
operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of
operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Issuer will also (a) file a
press release with the appropriate internationally recognized wire services in connection with such report
and (b) post such report on the Issuer's website. The Issuer will also make available copies of all reports
required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, if and so long as the Notes are
listed on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, to the extent and in the manner permitted
by such rules, post such reports on the official website of the Exchange (www.tisegroup.com).

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports
required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if
filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information,
certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the
Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that
the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon
complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions
contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee shall be for informational purposes only
and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute actual or constructive notice of any information
contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Issuer's compliance
with any of its covenants under the Indenture or the Notes (as to which the Trustee shall have no duty to
monitor or confirm and shall be entitled to rely exclusively on Officer's Certificates). The Trustee shall not
be obligated to monitor or confirm, on a continuing basis or otherwise, the Issuer's compliance with the
covenants or with respect to any reports or other documents filed with any website under the Indenture.

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Board of Directors of the Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary (including any newly
acquired or newly formed Restricted Subsidiary) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would
not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate
Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the
Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the
time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under "—Restricted
_Payments" or under one or more clauses of the definition of "Permitted Investments," as determined by the_
Issuer. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the
Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Issuer may
redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause
a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee
by filing with the Trustee a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation
and an Officer's Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions and
was permitted under "—Restricted Payments." If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to
meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be
incurred as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under "—
_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock," the Issuer will be in default of such covenant._


-----

The Board of Directors of the Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a
Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness
by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such
designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under "—Incurrence of
_Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock," calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had_
occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Default would be in existence
following such designation.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

At the request of the Issuer and without the consent of the Holders, at the time of, or prior to, the incurrence
by the Issuer or a Guarantor of Indebtedness permitted to share in the Collateral, the Issuer or the relevant
Guarantor, the Trustee and the Security Agent (as applicable) shall enter into with the holders of such
Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) an additional intercreditor agreement (an
"Additional Intercreditor Agreement") on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement
or an amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement (which amendment does not adversely affect the rights of
the Holders in any material respect, as determined in good faith by the Issuer), it being understood that, for
the avoidance of doubt, an increase in the amount of Indebtedness being subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement will be deemed to be on substantially
similar terms to the Intercreditor Agreement and will be deemed not to adversely affect the rights of the
Holders and will be permitted by this covenant if, in each case, the incurrence of such Indebtedness (and
any Lien in its favor) is permitted by "—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock" and
"—Liens."

At the request of the Issuer, without the consent of the Holders, and at the time of, or prior to, the incurrence
by the Issuer or a Guarantor of Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to the preceding paragraph,
the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, the Trustee and the Security Agent (as applicable) shall enter into one
or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure
defects, resolve ambiguities or reflect changes, in each case, of a minor, technical or administrative nature;
(2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement that may be incurred by the Issuer or a Guarantor that is subject to any Intercreditor
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement (provided that such amendment is consistent with the
preceding paragraph); (3) add new Guarantors to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement; (4) further secure the Notes; (5) make provision for the security securing Additional Notes to
rank _pari passu with the Collateral; (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens; (7) amend the_
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof;
or (8) make any other change to any such Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement
that does not adversely affect the rights of the Holders in any material respect. In formulating its opinion
on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall be entitled to request and rely absolutely on such
evidence as it deems appropriate, including an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel.

The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders,
except as otherwise permitted by "—Amendments and Waivers" or as described in the preceding paragraph
and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent
such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or adversely
affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement or such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In relation to the Intercreditor Agreement or, to the extent applicable, an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee shall be deemed to have consented on behalf of the Holders to any payment,
repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations
subordinated to the Notes thereby; _provided that such transaction would comply with the covenant_
described under "—Restricted Payments."

Each Holder shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the
future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have consented to and directed the Trustee and
the Security Agent to enter into any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any amendment of the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement which complies with the foregoing
provision and the conditions contained therein.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a "Suspension Event"), then, beginning on that day
and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the
"Reversion Date"), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply
to the Notes: "—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock," "—Restricted Payments,"
"—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries," "—Limitations on Sales of
_Assets and Subsidiary Stock," "—Transactions with Affiliates," the provisions of clause (4) of the first_
paragraph under "—Merger and Consolidation" and "—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted
_Subsidiaries" and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and_
will not be applicable to the Group. Such provisions and any related default provisions will again apply
according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such
provisions will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer and any Restricted
Subsidiary (respectively) properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action
taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The provisions described
under "—Restricted Payments" will be interpreted as if they have been in effect since the Issue Date but not
during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during
the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so
that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(a) or (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the provision
described under "—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock." In addition, the Indenture
will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the
Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into
during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer having an Investment Grade
Status.

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any
knowledge of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve
Investment Grade Status or upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee
in writing that the conditions under this covenant have been satisfied, although such notification shall not
be a condition for suspension of the covenants to be effective. The Trustee shall not be obliged to notify
Holders of a Suspension Event or, if applicable, upon the occurrence of a Reversion Date.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect and, once effective, maintain the listing of
the Notes on the Exchange for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if at any time the Issuer
determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will obtain prior to the delisting of the Notes from the
Exchange, and thereafter use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, a listing of such Notes on
another recognized stock exchange or exchange regulated market in western Europe.

**_Financial Calculations_**

For the purpose of calculating any Applicable Metric (including the financial definitions or components
thereof but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Excess Cash Flow) in the Finance Documents, including
when determining (or, as applicable, forecasting) Consolidated EBITDA for any Relevant Testing Period
(including the portion thereof occurring prior to any relevant Purchase (as defined below)), the Issuer may:

(1) if during such period any member of the Group (by merger or otherwise) has made or committed
(unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) to make an Investment in any person that thereby becomes
(or that the Issuer expects in good faith, based upon such commitment, will become) a Restricted
Subsidiary or otherwise has acquired or committed (unilaterally, conditionally or otherwise) to
acquire any entity, business, property or material fixed asset (including the acquisition, opening
and/or development of any new site or operation) (any such Investment, acquisition or commitment
therefor, a "Purchase"), including any such Purchase occurring in connection with a transaction
causing a calculation to be made under the Indenture or the other Finance Documents, calculate
Consolidated EBITDA for such period on the basis that the earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization (calculated on the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA, _mutatis_
_mutandis) attributable to the assets which are the subject of such Purchase during such Relevant_


-----

Testing Period shall be included as if the Purchase occurred on the first day of such Relevant
Testing Period; and/or

(2) include an adjustment in respect of any Purchase and/or any steps taken or committed or expected
to be taken in respect of such Purchase up to the amount of the pro forma increase in Consolidated
EBITDA projected by the Issuer (in good faith) after taking into account the full "run rate" effect
of:

(a) all synergies, cost savings, operating expense reductions, revenue increases, operating
improvements or other similar initiatives which the Issuer (in good faith) determines have
been achieved (in full or in part) at any time during such period directly or indirectly as a
consequence of the Purchase or any related steps, without prejudice to the synergies, cost
savings, operating expense reductions, revenue increases, operating improvements or
other similar initiatives actually realized during the Relevant Testing Period and already
included in Consolidated EBITDA, provided that so long as such synergies, cost savings,
operating expense reductions, revenue increases, operating improvements or other similar
initiatives have been realized at any time during such period, it may be assumed they were
realized during the entire such period; and/or

(b) all synergies, cost savings, operating expense reductions, revenue increases, operating
improvements or other similar initiatives which the Issuer (in good faith) believes can be
achieved following the end of such period directly or indirectly as a consequence of the
Purchase or any related steps (the "Forward-Looking Purchase Synergies"), provided
_that_ so long as such Forward-Looking Purchase Synergies will be realizable at any time
in the future, it may be assumed they will be realizable during the entire such period;
and/or

(3) exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses directly or indirectly related to the Purchase.

For the purpose of calculating any Applicable Metric (including the financial definitions or components
thereof but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Excess Cash Flow) in the Finance Documents, including
when determining (or, as applicable, forecasting) Consolidated EBITDA for any Relevant Testing Period
(including the portion thereof occurring prior to any relevant Sale (as defined below)), the Issuer may:

(1) if during such period any member of the Group has disposed or committed (unilaterally,
conditionally or otherwise) to make a disposal of any person, property, business or material fixed
asset or any group of assets constituting an operating unit of a business sold, transferred or
otherwise disposed of by the Group (any such sale, transfer, disposition or commitment therefor, a
"Sale") or if the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate Consolidated EBITDA relates to
such a Sale, calculate Consolidated EBITDA for such period on the basis that Consolidated
EBITDA will be reduced by an amount equal to the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation,
amortization and impairment (calculated on the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA, _mutatis_
_mutandis) (if positive) attributable to the assets which are the subject of such Sale for such period_
or increased by an amount equal to the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and
impairment (calculated on the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA, mutatis mutandis) (if negative)
attributable thereto for such period as if the Sale occurred on the first day of such Relevant Testing
Period, _provided that_ if the Issuer elects to make such an adjustment and the relevant sale
constitutes "discontinued operations" in accordance with IFRS or the generally accepted
accounting principles in the Issuer's jurisdiction of incorporation, Consolidated Net Income shall
be reduced by an amount equal to the Consolidated Net Income (if positive) attributable to such
operations for such period or increased by an amount equal to the Consolidated Net Income (if
negative) attributable thereto for such period; and/or

(2) include an adjustment in respect of any Sale and/or any steps taken or committed or expected to be
taken in respect of such Sale up to the amount of the pro forma increase in Consolidated EBITDA
projected by the Issuer (in good faith) after taking into account the full "run rate" effect of:

(a) all synergies, cost savings, operating expense reductions, revenue increases, operating
improvements or other similar initiatives which the Issuer (in good faith) determines have
been achieved (in full or in part) at any time during such period directly or indirectly as a
consequence of the Sale or any related steps, without prejudice to the synergies, cost


-----

savings, operating expense reductions, revenue increases, operating improvements or
other similar initiatives actually realized during the Relevant Testing Period and already
included in Consolidated EBITDA, provided that so long as such synergies, cost savings,
operating expense reductions, revenue increases, operating improvements or other similar
initiatives have been realized at any time during such period, it may be assumed they were
realized during the entire such period; and/or

(b) all synergies, cost savings, operating expense reductions, revenue increases, operating
improvements or other similar initiatives which the Issuer (in good faith) believes can be
achieved following the end of such period directly or indirectly as a consequence of the
Sale or any related steps (the "Forward-Looking Sale Synergies"), provided that so long
as such Forward-Looking Sale Synergies will be realizable at any time in the future, it
may be assumed they will be realizable during the entire such period; and/or

(3) exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses directly or indirectly related to the Sale; and/or

For the purpose of calculating any Applicable Metric (including the financial definitions or components
thereof but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Excess Cash Flow) in the Finance Documents, including
when determining (or, as applicable, forecasting) Consolidated EBITDA for any Relevant Testing Period
(including the portion thereof occurring prior to implementing or committing to implement such Group
Initiative), the Issuer may:

(1) include an adjustment in respect of each Group Initiative and/or any steps committed to be taken
in respect of such Group Initiative up to the amount of the pro forma increase in Consolidated
EBITDA projected by the Issuer (in good faith) after taking into account the full "run rate" effect
of:

(a) all synergies, cost savings, operating expense reductions, revenue increases, operating
improvements or other adjustments or similar initiatives which the Issuer (in good faith)
determines have been achieved (in full or in part) at any time during such period directly
or indirectly as a consequence of implementing or committing to implement such Group
Initiative or any related steps, without prejudice to the synergies, cost savings, operating
expense reductions, revenue increases, operating improvements or other similar initiatives
actually realized during the Relevant Testing Period and already included in Consolidated
EBITDA, _provided that_ so long as such synergies, cost savings, operating expense
reductions, revenue increases, operating improvements or other similar initiatives have
been realized at any time during such period, it may be assumed they were realized during
the entire such period; and/or

(b) all synergies, cost savings, operating expense reductions, revenue increases, operating
improvements or other adjustments or similar initiatives which the Issuer (in good faith)
believes can be achieved following the end of such period directly or indirectly as a
consequence of implementing or committing to implement such Group Initiative or any
related steps (the "Forward-Looking Group Initiative Synergies"), _provided that_ so
long as such Forward-Looking Group Initiative Synergies will be realizable at any time in
the future, it may be assumed they will be realizable during the entire such period; and/or

(2) exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses directly or indirectly related to the
implementation of, or commitment to, implement such Group Initiative.

In relation to the financial definitions and all other related provisions of the Indenture:

(1) all calculations will be as determined in good faith by an Officer of the Issuer (including in respect
of synergies, cost savings, operating expense reductions, revenue increases, operating
improvements or other similar initiatives); and

(2) all calculations in respect of synergies, cost savings, operating expense reductions, revenue
increases, operating improvements or other similar initiatives (in each case actual or anticipated)
may be made as though the full run-rate effect of such synergies, cost savings, operating expense
reductions, revenue increases, operating improvements or other similar initiatives were realized on
the first day of the Relevant Testing Period.


-----

Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Net Income for any part of a Relevant Testing Period falling prior
to the Completion Date shall be calculated on an actual basis over the Relevant Testing Period (whereby
for any part of the applicable Relevant Testing Period falling prior to the date on which the Target Group
became part of the Group, such amount shall be calculated based on actual historic data for the
corresponding period available and by reference to the Target Group as adjusted in accordance with the
provisions of this Clause and the other provisions of the Indenture) or, at the Issuer's option, on the basis of
the base case financial model prepared in connection with the Transactions and delivered to the lenders and
agent under the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement.

In the event that:

(1) any fiscal year end or quarterly period end that is adjusted by the Issuer to avoid such fiscal year
end or quarterly period end falling on a day which is not a Business Day and/or to ensure that a
fiscal year end or quarterly period end falls on a particular day of the week; or

(2) there is any adjustment to a scheduled payment date to avoid payments becoming due on a day
which is not a Business Day,

if that adjustment results in any amount being paid in a Relevant Testing Period in which it would otherwise
not have been paid, for the purpose of calculating any Applicable Metric under the Finance Documents the
Issuer may (at its option) treat such amount as if it was paid in the Relevant Testing Period in which it
would have been paid save for any such adjustment.

Unless a contrary indication appears, (i) a reference in the Finance Documents to Consolidated Net Income,
Consolidated EBITDA, the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured
Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio or the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is to be
construed as a reference to Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA, the Consolidated Senior
Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Leverage
Ratio or the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Group on a consolidated basis; and (ii) references to any
Applicable Metric are made to such Applicable Metric for the Relevant Period ending on the Applicable
Test Date.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including anything in the financial definitions), when calculating
any Applicable Metric, the financial definitions or component thereof but excluding Excess Cash Flow, the
Issuer shall be permitted to:

(1) exclude all or any part of any expenditure or other negative item (and/or the impact thereof) directly
or indirectly relating to or resulting from:

(a) the Transactions;

(b) any other acquisition, Investment or other joint venture permitted by the terms of the
Indenture or the impact from purchase price accounting;

(c) start-up costs for new businesses and branding or re-branding of existing businesses;

(d) Restructuring Costs;

(e) research and development expenditure (and the capitalization thereof); and/or

(f) the implementation of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and/or IFRS 16
(Leases) and any successor standard thereto (or any equivalent measure under IFRS or the
generally accepted accounting principles in the Issuer's jurisdiction of incorporation);
and/or

(2) include any addbacks (without further verification or diligence) for adjustments (including
anticipated synergies) or costs or expenses (i) reflected in the base case financial model prepared
in connection with the Transactions and delivered to the lenders and agent under the 2023 Senior
Facilities Agreement, due diligence reports prepared in connection with the Transactions and
delivered to the lenders and agent under the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement and/or any quality
of earnings report provided to the mandated lead arrangers under the 2023 Senior Facilities
Agreement prior to the date of the Indenture (as amended, varied, supplemented and/or updated on


-----

or prior to the Completion Date, to the extent such amendment, variation, supplement and/or update
is not materially prejudicial to the Holders) and/or (ii) taken into account in determining Opening
Consolidated EBITDA.

To the extent any Applicable Metric is used as the basis (in whole or in part) for permitting any transaction
or making any determination under the Indenture (including on a pro forma basis), no item shall be included
or excluded more than once where to do so would result in double counting.

Any Applicable Metric to be determined in connection with an Applicable Transaction may, at the Issuer's
option, be determined as at the Applicable Test Date.

If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with paragraph directly above, such
Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes; provided that:

(1) the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate any Applicable Metric on the basis of a
more recent Applicable Test Date, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be
deemed to be the relevant Applicable Test Date for purposes of such Applicable Metrics; and

(2) save as contemplated in clause (1) above, compliance with any Applicable Metric shall not be
determined or tested at any time after the relevant Applicable Test Date for such transaction and
any actions or transactions related thereto.

If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an Applicable Test Date
would at any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been
complied with as a result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (or any other Applicable Metric), such
Applicable Metric will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a
result of such fluctuations.

If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event
of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the Applicable Test Date
would at any time after the Applicable Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due
to the occurrence or continuation of a Default or an Event of Default), such requirements and conditions
will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of
Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing).

Subject to clause (8) of the third paragraph of "—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and
_Issuance of Preferred Stock," in calculating the availability under any Applicable Metric in connection with_
any action or transaction unrelated to the Applicable Transaction following the relevant Applicable Test
Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Applicable Transaction is consummated or the Issuer
determines (in its sole discretion) that such Applicable Transaction will not be consummated, any such
Applicable Metric shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Applicable Transaction.

Any Incurrence or drawing of any revolving Indebtedness to finance the working capital needs of the Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (including under the New Revolving Credit Facility) and, for the
avoidance of doubt, subject to clause (8) of the third paragraph of "—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of
_Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock," any undrawn commitments for Indebtedness (including_
under the New Revolving Credit Facility) shall be disregarded for the purposes of testing the Applicable
Metric.

If, in connection with the same Applicable Transaction or otherwise substantially simultaneously:

(1)

(a) any Applicable Metrics required to be determined by reference to a fixed currency amount
or a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA (a "fixed permission") are intended to be
utilized; and/or

(b) revolving Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness under the Reserved Indebtedness
Amount) is intended to be Incurred; and

(2) any Applicable Metrics required to be determined by reference to the Consolidated Senior Secured
Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Leverage


-----

Ratio, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or any other ratio-based Applicable Metric (a "ratio-based
**permission") are intended to be utilized (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any determination**
of any increase or decrease in any such Applicable Metric, including in accordance with clause
(5)(b) of the second paragraph of "—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance
_of Preferred Stock"),_

then: (x) amounts available to be incurred under the applicable ratio-based permissions shall first be
calculated without giving effect to amounts to be incurred under the applicable fixed permissions or the
applicable Incurrence of revolving Indebtedness, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer; and (y) thereafter,
compliance with any relevant fixed permissions shall be calculated, and, in each case, full pro forma effect
shall be given to all increases to Consolidated EBITDA and repayments or discharges of Indebtedness in
connection with such Applicable Transaction in accordance with the Indenture.

If any Applicable Metric is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed amount (the "numerical
**permission") and a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA (the "grower permission") and the grower**
permission of the Applicable Metric exceeds the applicable numerical permission at any time, the numerical
permission shall be deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the grower permission reached from
time to time and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower permission.

In the event that any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more than one Applicable Metric, the Issuer
may (in its sole discretion), subject to the limitations imposed under clause (2) of the third paragraph of "—
_Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock," classify and reclassify_
that amount or transaction to a particular Applicable Metric and will only be required to include that amount
or transaction in one of those Applicable Metrics (and, for the avoidance of doubt, an amount may, at the
option of the Issuer, be split between different Applicable Metrics).

Subject to the limitations imposed under clause (2) of the third paragraph of "—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock," if a proposed action, matter, transaction or_
amount (or a portion thereof) is incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission and at a later time
would subsequently be permitted under a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer,
such action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such
ratio-based permission.

For purposes of determining compliance with:

(1) any euro denominated Applicable Metric (other than in respect of any calculation of any financial
covenant or ratio under the Finance Documents or related usage, ratchet or permission), the euro
equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated using a rate of
exchange selected by the Issuer (acting reasonably and in good faith) on the Applicable Test Date
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the rate of any foreign exchange hedging entered into by
the Group in relation to the Applicable Transaction); or

(2) any other Applicable Metric (including in respect of any calculation of any financial covenant or
ratio under the Finance Documents), the euro equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign
currency shall be calculated, at the Issuer's option, using any of:

(a) any applicable weighted average spot conversion rates over the relevant testing period;

(b) any applicable conversion rates used in any relevant financial statements or management
accounts;

(c) any applicable conversion rate selected by the Issuer (acting reasonably and in good faith)
on the relevant date of determination (including the Applicable Test Date, if applicable);
or

(d) any applicable conversion rate under any foreign exchange hedging arrangement entered
into by any member of the Group;

and, in each case, no Default, Event of Default or any breach of representation or warranty or
undertaking shall arise merely as a result of a subsequent change in the euro equivalent amount of
any relevant amount due to fluctuations in exchange rates.


-----

For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a Financial Year, a calendar year, a Relevant Testing
Period, a four-quarter period, a twelve-month period or any other similar annual period (each an "Annual
**Period"):**

(1) at the option of the Issuer, the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during
such Annual Period may be increased by:

(a) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive) between the permitted amount in
the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof actually used or applied
by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the "Carry Forward Amount");
and/or

(b) an amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following Annual
Period and the permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall be
reduced by such corresponding amount (the "Carry Back Amount"); and

(2) to the extent that the maximum amount so permitted under such Applicable Metric during such
Annual Period is increased in accordance with clause (1) above, any usage of such Applicable
Metric during such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the following order:

(a) **_first, against the Carry Forward Amount;_**

(b) **_secondly, against the maximum amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior to_**
any increase in accordance with clause (1) above; and

(c) **_thirdly, against the Carry Back Amount._**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, when calculating Consolidated Net Income and Consolidated
EBITDA at any time prior to the Control Date, the amounts of Consolidated Net Income and Consolidated
EBITDA, to the extent related to the Target Group, shall be reduced proportionally to the amount of Capital
Stock of the Target that is beneficially owned by the Issuer.

**Open Market and Negotiated Purchases**

The Issuer, any of its Affiliates or any third party acting on their behalf may at any time purchase Notes, in
whole or in part, in the open market, in negotiated transactions or otherwise at any price, in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture and applicable securities laws. Any such purchased Notes will not be resold,
except in compliance with the Indenture and applicable requirements or exemptions under any relevant
securities laws.

**Events of Default**

An "Event of Default" will be defined in the Indenture as:

(1) a default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note when due,
continued for 30 days;

(2) a default in the payment of principal of any Note when due, whether at its Stated Maturity, upon
optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise;

(3) the failure by the Issuer to comply for 60 days after notice with its other agreements contained in
the Notes or the Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries), whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the
date of the Indenture, if that default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness at the Stated Maturity thereof
prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the date of
such default (a "Payment Default"); or


-----

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity,

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the
maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates to the greater of €100 million and 20% of
Consolidated EBITDA or more (the "cross-acceleration provision");

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or insolvent reorganization of the Issuer or a Significant
Subsidiary, or of other Subsidiaries that are not Significant Subsidiaries but would in the aggregate
constitute a Significant Subsidiary if considered as a single Person (the "bankruptcy provisions");

(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or any group of its Restricted Subsidiaries that,
taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments entered
by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction aggregating in excess of the greater of €100 million
and 20% of Consolidated EBITDA (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company
has acknowledged liability for), which judgments shall not have been discharged or waived and
there shall have been a period of 60 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of such
judgment or order, by reason of an appeal, waiver or otherwise, shall not have been in effect (the
"judgment default provision"); or

(7) the failure of any Note Guarantee by the Issuer or a Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary to
be in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms thereof or of the Indenture) or the
denial or disaffirmation in writing by the Issuer or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary
of its obligations under the Indenture or its Note Guarantee, if such Default continues for 20 days.

The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and
whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree
or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body.

However, a Default under clause (iii) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders
of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuer (and the Trustee if given by
Holders) of the Default and the Issuer does not cure such Default within the time specified in such clause
after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than a Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization of the Issuer) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee by written notice to
the Issuer, or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to
the Issuer and the Trustee, may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Notes to
be due and payable. Upon the effectiveness of such a declaration, such principal and interest will be due
and payable immediately.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency
or reorganization of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary occurs and is continuing, the principal of and
accrued but unpaid interest on all the Notes will become immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Under certain circumstances, the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect
to the Notes and its consequences.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice thereof, the
Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request
or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee and, if requested, the
Trustee has received, customary indemnification and/or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability
or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when
due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless (i) such Holder
has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing, (ii) Holders of at
least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee in writing to pursue the
remedy, (iii) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any
loss, liability or expense, (iv) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt
of the request and the offer of security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability


-----

or expense and (v) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given
the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however,
may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is
unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an
affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not any such directions are unduly prejudicial to such Holders) or
that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the
Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all
losses, liabilities and expenses (including legal fees) caused by taking or not taking such action.

It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in
such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity
to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

The Indenture will provide that if the Trustee has received written notice (in accordance with the terms of
the Indenture) that a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee must send
to each Holder notice of the Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it receives such written notice.

Except in the case of an Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or premium (if any) or interest on
or Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to, any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as
it in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. In addition, the Issuer
is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer's Certificate
indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default occurring during the
previous year. The Issuer also is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence
thereof, written notice of any event that would constitute certain Defaults or Events of Default, their status
and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of such Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such
Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be
waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer
for, the Notes). Without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clauses (8) and
(10), 75%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (or, alternatively, the
consent of each Holder affected thereby), an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held
by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note;

adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms
of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described
thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described


-----

thereunder unless the Issuer or the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in
respect thereof;

(8) release (i) any Security Interest granted for the benefit of the Trustee or the Holders in the Collateral,
(ii) of the security interest in the Escrowed Funds, in each case, other than in accordance with the
terms of the Transaction Security Documents, Escrow Account Charge, the Escrow Agreement,
the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of
acceleration of such Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of
such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release any Guarantor from any of their obligations under their respective Note Guarantees or the
Indenture, in each case, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(11) expressly subordinate the Notes or any Note Guarantee related thereto to any other Indebtedness
of the Issuer or any Guarantor other than as contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(12) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders' consent
described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security
Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary under any Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Trustee or the Holders
or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee, the Security Agent
or the Holders or that does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee, the Security
Agent or any of the Holders in any material respect under the Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a
member of senior management of the Group) for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the
provisions described under the "—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock"
section, to add Note Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of
the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Note
Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Transaction Security Documents) or any
amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination,
discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under the Indenture, the Transaction Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Note Guarantees, the Transaction Security Documents,
the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Account Charge or the Notes to any provision of this
"Description of the Notes" to the extent that such provision in this "Description of the Notes" was
intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, a Note Guarantee, the
Transaction Security Documents, the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Account Charge or the Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or Security Agent
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or the Security
Agent to any Notes Document;


-----

(9) in the case of the Transaction Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a
Lien in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Trustee, the Holders or parties to the New
Revolving Credit Facility, in any property which is required by the Transaction Security
Documents or the New Revolving Credit Facility (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged,
pledged or hypothecated, or in which a Lien is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to
the extent necessary to grant a Lien in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that
the granting of such Lien is not prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the provisions described under "—Impairment of Security
_Interest" are complied with; or_

(10) as provided in "—Additional Intercreditor Agreements" or "—Impairment of Security Interests."

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on
such evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer's Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the
proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes
given in connection with a tender of such Holder's Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all of its obligations under the Notes and the Indenture ("legal
**defeasance"), except for certain obligations, including those relating to the defeasance trust, the rights,**
powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in
connection therewith and obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the Notes, to replace mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, to reimburse certain costs and provide indemnification and to maintain a
registrar and paying agent in respect of the Notes. The Issuer at any time may terminate its and any
Guarantors' obligations under certain covenants under the Indenture, including the covenants described
under "—Certain Covenants" and "—Change of Control," the operation of the default provisions relating
to such covenants described under "—Events of Default" above, the operation of the cross acceleration
provision, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to Subsidiaries of the Issuer and the judgment default
provision described under "—Events of Default" above, and the limitations contained in clauses (iii) and
(iv) under "—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation" above ("covenant defeasance"). If the
Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option, each Guarantor will be
released from all of its obligations with respect to its Note Guarantee.

The Issuer may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant
defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be
accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Issuer exercises its covenant
defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified
in clause (iv), (v) (as it relates to the covenants described under "—Certain Covenants" above), (vi), (vii),
(viii) (but only with respect to events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of a Subsidiary of the
Issuer), (ix) or (x) under "—Events of Default" above or because of the failure of the Issuer to comply with
clause (iii) and (iv) under "—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation" above.

Either defeasance option may be exercised until any redemption date or the maturity date of the Notes. In
order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited in
trust (the "defeasance trust") with the Paying Agent cash in euro or direct obligations (or certificates
representing an interest in such obligations) issued by, or unconditionally guaranteed by, the government
of a member state of the Pre-Expansion European Union, the United States of America, Switzerland,
Norway, Japan or Canada (including, in each case, any agency or instrumentality thereof), as the case may
be, the payment of which is backed by the full faith and credit of the relevant member state of the European
Union or the United States of America, Switzerland, Norway, Japan or Canada, as the case may be, and
which are not callable or redeemable at the Issuer's option or a combination thereof in an amount sufficient
(without reinvestment), in the opinion of an independent firm of certified public accountants, to pay
principal of, and premium (if any) and interest on, the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be,
and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of (i) an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that beneficial owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case


-----

if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and, in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of
Counsel must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service addressed to the Issuer, a revenue
ruling or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the Issue Date); (ii) an Officer's
Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering,
delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer; (iii) an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion
of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each
stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as
the case may be, have been complied with; and (iv) all other documents or other information that the Trustee
may reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and cease to be of further effect as to all outstanding Notes when (i) either
(a) all Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and
certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been
released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or (b) all Notes not previously
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (x) have become due and payable, (y) will become due and payable
at their Stated Maturity within one year or (z) have been or are to be called for redemption within one year
under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the
Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (ii) the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to
be deposited with the Paying Agent money, cash in euro or direct obligations (or certificates representing
an interest in such obligations) issued by, or unconditionally guaranteed by, the government of a member
state of the Pre-Expansion European Union, the United States of America, Switzerland, Norway, Japan or
Canada (including, in each case, any agency or instrumentality thereof), as the case may be, the payment
of which is backed by the full faith and credit of the relevant member state of the European Union or the
United States of America, Switzerland, Norway, Japan or Canada, as the case may be, and which are not
callable or redeemable at the Issuer's option or a combination thereof in an amount sufficient (without
reinvestment) in the opinion of an independent firm of certified public accountants, to pay and discharge
the entire indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal,
premium, if any, and interest to the date of redemption or their Stated Maturity, as the case may be; (iii) the
Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture by the Issuer; and (iv) the
Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that
all conditions precedent under the "Satisfaction and Discharge" section of the Indenture relating to the
satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may
rely on any Officer's Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii)); provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium,
the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is
deposited with the Paying Agent equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of deposit, with
any deficit as of the date of redemption only required to be deposited with the Paying Agent on or prior to
the date of redemption.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees, Incorporators and Stockholders**

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer, any
Guarantor or any Subsidiary of any thereof shall have any liability for any obligation of the Issuer, or any
Guarantor under the Indenture, the Notes or any Note Guarantee, or for any claim based on, in respect of,
or by reason of, any such obligation or its creation.

Each Holder, by accepting the Notes, waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part
of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.

**Concerning the Trustee**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is the Trustee under the Indenture. The Trustee assumes no responsibility for
the accuracy or completeness of the information concerning the Issuer or its Affiliates or any other party
contained in this Offering Memorandum or the related documents or for any failure by the Issuer or any
other party to disclose events that may have occurred and may affect the significance or accuracy of such
information. The Trustee shall not be responsible for determining whether any Change of Control occurred
and whether any Change of Control Offer with respect to the Notes is required. The Trustee shall not be
responsible for monitoring the rating status of the Issuer or its Affiliates, making any request upon any
Rating Agency, determining whether any rating event with respect to the Notes has occurred.


-----

The Indenture provides that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default that is known to a
responsible officer of the Trustee who has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties
as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default that is known to a
responsible officer of the Trustee who has received written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the
rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise
as a prudent person would exercise under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.
The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture
will not be construed as an obligation or duty. Furthermore, the Trustee will be under no obligation to
exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder, unless such Holder
has offered to the Trustee, and the Trustee has received, customary protection and indemnification.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, Taxes or
expenses (including legal fees) incurred without gross negligence, wilful default or fraud on its part, arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Judgment Currency**

Euros is the required currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer or any Guarantor
under the Notes, any Note Guarantee thereof and the Indenture. Any payment on account of an amount that
is payable in euros, which is made to or for the account of any Noteholder, Paying Agent or the Trustee in
lawful currency of any other jurisdiction (the "Judgment Currency"), whether as a result of any judgment
or order or the enforcement thereof or the liquidation of the Issuer or any Guarantor, shall constitute a
discharge of the Issuer or the Guarantor's obligation under the Indenture and the Notes or Note Guarantee,
as the case may be, only to the extent of the amount of euros, that such Noteholder, Paying Agent or the
Trustee, as the case may be, could purchase in the London foreign exchange markets with the amount of
the Judgment Currency in accordance with normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing
on the first Business Day following receipt of the payment in the Judgment Currency. If the amount of
euros that could be so purchased is less than the amount of euros originally due to such Noteholder, Paying
Agent or the Trustee, as the case may be, the Issuer and the Guarantors shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Noteholder, Paying Agent or the Trustee, as the case may be, from and against all loss or damage arising
out of, or as a result of, such deficiency. This indemnity shall constitute an obligation separate and
independent from the other obligations contained in the Indenture or the Notes, shall give rise to a separate
and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by any Noteholder,
Paying Agent or the Trustee from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding
any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or under any judgment
or order.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Noteholder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. Upon any transfer or
exchange, the Registrar and the Trustee may require such Noteholder, among other things, to furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the Issuer may require such Noteholder to pay any
Taxes or other governmental charges required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Issuer is not
required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or purchase, or otherwise to transfer or
exchange any Note for a period of two Business Days prior to any redemption date or purchase date. No
service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of the Notes, but the Issuer may
require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer Tax or other governmental charge payable in
connection with the transfer or exchange. The Notes will be issued in registered form and the Holder of a
Note will be treated as the owner of such Note for all purposes.

**Listing**

Application will be made to the Exchange for the Notes to be admitted to the official list and to trading on
the Exchange. We cannot assure you that the application to list the Notes on the Exchange and to admit the
Notes on the Exchange will be approved and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this
listing.

Issue Date, obtain a copy of the Indenture without charge by writing to the Issuer at Ephios Subco 3 S.à r.l.,

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
"Regulation S Global Notes"). The Regulation S Global Notes representing the Notes (the "Regulation S
**Global Notes") will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and registered in the name**
of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

The Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the "Rule 144A Global Notes" and, together with the Regulation S Global Notes, the
"Global Notes"). The Rule 144A Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common
depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes ("Rule **144A Book-Entry Interests") and ownership**
of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the "Regulation S Book-Entry Interests" and, together with
the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the "Book-Entry Interests") will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.
Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and/or Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry
Interests in Global Notes will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes may only be traded in denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant's account
with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain
states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such
securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge
Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of interests in the Global
Notes will not have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in
certificated form (subject to very limited exceptions) and will not be considered the registered owners or
"holder" of the Notes under the Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable (or its nominees) will be considered the holder for all purposes under the Indenture. As such,
participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and indirect participants
must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and the participants through which
they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of Holders under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Trustee nor any of their
respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the BookEntry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered
Notes (as defined below):

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary
and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

(2) if Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an Event of Default under the Indenture; or

(3) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear or Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture.


-----

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (3), their current procedure is to request that we issue or
cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or us, as
applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received
from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive
Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not
required by the Indenture or applicable law.

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer
or a partial redemption of one Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued
to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to
the transferor or the holder, as applicable, in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or
redeemed; provided that a Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in denominations of €100,000 or
in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes
have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are
surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of the Transfer Agent, we will issue and the Trustee or an
authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note
if the Trustee's and our requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require a holder requesting
replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both
the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from
any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We and/or the Trustee
may charge for expenses in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to
become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture, we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or
purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in accordance
with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the
transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See "Notice to Investors."

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and
any of their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the
absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of
the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the
Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in
Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable,
will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the
Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of
such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry
Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection
with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that under existing
practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time,
Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants' accounts on a proportionate basis (with
adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate in


-----

accordance with their respective operational procedures; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of
less than €100,000 principal amount at maturity, or less, may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent. The Paying
Agent will, in turn, make such payments to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, which
will distribute such payments to Euroclear and Clearstream which will distribute them to their participants
in accordance with their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer
Agent, the Registrar and any of their respective agents will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes
(for example, Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose
of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the
Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the Paying Agent nor any of their respective agents has or will have any
responsibility or liability for:

- any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by
Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating
to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest;

- Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

- the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility
of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in
"street name."

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations
of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers,
the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of their respective agents will be liable to any
holder of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or
resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment. Holders
may be subject to foreign exchange risks that may have economic and tax consequences to them.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Notes will be paid to holders of interest in such notes through Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in
euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
Holder only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream
will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in
respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and
Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated
form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.


-----

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be done in accordance with Euroclear and
Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery
of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states which require
physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the
Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance
with the provisions of the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in "Notice to Investors." Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in "Notice to Investors."

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon
delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the
transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A under
the Securities Act (if available).

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in "Notice to Investors," Book-Entry Interests may be transferred
and exchanged as described under "Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange." Any Book-Entry
Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a BookEntry Interest in the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a BookEntry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global
Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry
Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only as described under "Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange" and, if required, only if the
transferor first delivers to the Trustee and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable
to such notes. See "Notice to Investors."

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee,
the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of their respective agents are responsible for
those operations or procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations, they also facilitate the clearance
and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry
changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their
participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of
internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets.
Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers
and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and
Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or
indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest
to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and Clearstream systems, or otherwise take
actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The
laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.
Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners
of beneficial interests through the Euroclear and Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable
to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear and Clearstream participants.


-----

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List. Transfers of
interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the
ordinary way in accordance with their respective system's rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no
obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or
modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the
Registrar, the Paying Agent nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the
performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective
obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the
settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in sameday funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser's and the seller's accounts are located to ensure
that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are
open for business.


-----

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**General**

**_Payments by a Guarantor_**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on the Notes (or other amounts due under the
Notes other than the repayment of principal under the Notes) it is possible that such payments may be
subject to withholding tax at applicable rates, subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions
of any applicable double taxation treaty, or to any other exemption which may apply.

**Certain Luxembourg Tax Considerations**

The following is a general description of certain Luxembourg tax considerations relating to the Notes. It
specifically contains information on taxes on the income from the Notes withheld at source and provides
an indication as to whether the Issuer assumes responsibility for the withholding of taxes at the source. It
does not purport to be a complete analysis of all tax considerations relating to the Notes, whether in
Luxembourg or elsewhere. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their own tax advisers as to
which countries' tax laws could be relevant to acquiring, holding and disposing of the Notes payments of
interest, principal and/or other amounts under the Notes and the consequences of such actions under the tax
laws of Luxembourg. The following is based upon the law as in effect on the date of this Offering
Memorandum. The information contained within this section is limited to withholding taxation issues, and
prospective investors should not apply any information set out below to other areas, including (but not
limited to) the legality of transactions involving the Notes.

Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for
Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a withholding
tax or a tax of a similar nature refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts only.

A Notes holder may not become resident, or deemed to be resident, in Luxembourg by reason only of the
holding of the Notes, or the execution, performance, delivery and/or enforcement of the Notes.

**_Withholding Tax_**

_Non-resident holders of Notes_

Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force, all payments of interest (including accrued but
unpaid interest) and principal by the Issuer to non-resident holders of Notes in the context of the holding,
disposal, redemption or repurchase of the Notes, which are not profit sharing, can be made free and clear
of any withholding tax.

_Resident holders of Notes_

In accordance with Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force and subject however to the application
of the Luxembourg law of December 23, 2005, as amended (the "Relibi **Law"), there is no withholding tax**
on payments of principal, premium or interest made to Luxembourg resident holders of Notes, nor on
accrued but unpaid interest in respect of Notes, nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax payable upon
redemption or repurchase of Notes held by Luxembourg resident holders of Notes.

The Relibi Law has introduced a 20% withholding tax on interest payments or similar income made or
ascribed by a paying agent established in Luxembourg to or for an individual beneficial owner who is a
resident of Luxembourg.

Pursuant to the law of December 23, 2005 as amended, Luxembourg resident individuals can opt to selfdeclare and pay a 20% levy on interest payments made or ascribed by paying agents located outside
Luxembourg in a Member State of either the European Union or the European Economic Area.

The 20% withholding tax as described above or the 20% levy are in full discharge of income tax when
Luxembourg resident individuals are acting in the context of the management of their private wealth.

Responsibility for the withholding of tax in application of the Relibi Law, is assumed by the Luxembourg
paying agent within the meaning of the Relibi Law and not by the Issuer.


-----

_Transposition of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive in Luxembourg law_

On December 18, 2018 and on December 20, 2019, Luxembourg transposed respectively the EU Council
Directive 2016/1164 laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning
of the internal market into Luxembourg domestic law, and the EU Council Directive 2017/952 amending
EU Council Directive 2016/1164 as regards hybrid mismatches with third countries into Luxembourg
domestic law (the "ATAD"). The ATAD introduced new tax measures into Luxembourg law, including
among others a limitation as regards so-called "exceeding borrowing costs" and hybrid mismatch rules.
Whilst certain exemptions and safe harbor provisions (for example, exceeding borrowing costs up to €3
million will remain deductible – subject to the implementation of the DEBRA Proposal as outlined below)
exist in relation to the limitation of exceeding borrowing costs, these new rules may in certain situations
result in the limitation respectively the denial of the deduction of payments to investors for Luxembourg
tax purposes, which may adversely affect the income tax position of the Issuer and as such affect generally
its ability to make payments to the Holders.

The exact impact of the ATAD on the Issuer would need to be monitored on a regular basis, notably in the
light of any future guidance from the Luxembourg tax authorities. Prospective Holders should make an
investment decision only after careful consideration, with its independent advisers, as to the consequences
of the ATAD.

_The Unshell Proposal_

The EU Commission published a proposal for a Council Directive laying down rules to prevent the misuse
of shell entities for tax purposes and amending Directive 2011/16/EU on December 22, 2021 (the so-called
"Unshell Proposal," also known as "ATAD 3").

These new rules would mainly apply to EU entities (i) deriving passive income, (ii) engaged in cross-border
transactions and (iii) which outsourced the administration of day-to-day operations and the decision-making
on significant functions. EU entities that meet these three conditions would need to declare in their annual
tax returns whether they meet indicators of minimum substance and provide related documentary evidence
(unless they benefit from an automatic exemption). Entities not meeting those indicators of minimum
substance and that cannot rely on an automatic exemption will be presumed not to have sufficient substance
for tax purposes (unless they can rebut this presumption by providing evidence (i) of the business activities
which they perform to generate their passive income or (ii) that they do not serve the objective of obtaining
a tax advantage). In this case and in the absence of rebuttal of the presumption, such EU entities would not
be allowed to benefit from the provisions of double tax treaties or certain EU Directives. In addition, they
would not be entitled to a certificate of tax residence to the extent that such certificate serves to obtain the
benefit of the aforementioned provisions. On January 17, 2023, the European Parliament approved the
European Commission's draft of the Unshell Proposal, as amended by the Committee on Economic and
Monetary Affairs on December 9, 2022. Based on discussions with various officials of Member States, an
agreement as regards the Unshell Proposal seems far from being achieved (noting that some
countries seem to strongly oppose the Unshell Proposal in its current condition). Therefore, the final text
will be further discussed and potentially amended by the Council of the European Union.

_The DEBRA Proposal_

On May 11, 2022, the EU Commission published a directive proposal laying down (i) a debt-equity bias
reduction allowance and (ii) a new limitation to the tax deductibility of exceeding borrowing costs (the socalled "DEBRA"). The purpose of the DEBRA proposal is to address the asymmetry in tax treatment
between debt and equity financing by neutralizing the bias against equity financing. The interest deduction
limitation rule provided by the DEBRA proposal will interact with the interest barrier rule provided by
ATAD (see above). While the interest barrier rule under the ATAD currently provides that exceeding
borrowing costs shall be deductible up to 30% of the taxable EBITDA (with a de minimis threshold of €3
million), the DEBRA proposal limits the deductibility of interest to 85% of exceeding borrowing costs.
Should the DEBRA proposal be adopted, Member States would have to implement the directive into their
national law by December 31, 2023 and the provisions would come into effect as of January 1, 2024.

**Certain German Tax Considerations**

The following is a general discussion of certain German tax consequences in relation to the Notes (in
particular regarding taxes on the income from the Notes withheld at source). It does not purport to be a


-----

comprehensive description of all German tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase
the Notes, and, in particular, does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a
particular purchaser. This summary is based on the tax laws of Germany currently in force and as applied
on the date of this Offering Memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or
retrospective effect. As each tranche of Notes may be subject to a different tax treatment due to the specific
terms of such tranche of Notes, the following section only provides some general information on the
possible German tax treatment.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences
of the purchase, ownership and disposal of the Notes, including the effect of any state, local or church taxes,
under the tax laws of Germany and any country in which they are resident or whose tax laws apply to them
for other reasons.

**_German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer)_**

With regard to savings earnings (Kapitalerträge) (e.g., interest or capital gains) German withholding tax
(Kapitalertragsteuer) will be levied if the Notes are held in a custodial account which the investor maintains
with a German securities institution or a German branch of a German or non-German credit or financial
services institution (a "German Disbursing Agent") and such German Disbursing Agent credits or pays
out the earnings. If the Notes are not kept or administered in a custodial account, German withholding tax
will nevertheless be levied if the Notes are issued as definitive securities and the savings earnings are paid
by a German Disbursing Agent against presentation of the Notes or interest coupons (so-called over-thecounter transaction – Tafelgeschäft).

The tax base is, in principle, equal to the taxable gross income as set out above (i.e., prior to withholding).
However, in the case of capital gains, if the custodial account has changed since the time of acquisition of
the Notes (e.g., if the Notes had been transferred from a non-EU custodial account prior to the sale) and the
acquisition costs of the Notes are not proven to the German Disbursing Agent in the form required by law
(e.g., in the case of over-the-counter transactions), withholding tax is applied to 30% of the proceeds from
the redemption or sale of the Notes. When computing the tax base for withholding tax purposes, the German
Disbursing Agent has to deduct any negative savings income (negative Kapitalerträge) or paid accrued
interest (Stückzinsen) in the same calendar year or unused negative savings income of previous calendar
years.

Losses arising from a full or partial non-recoverability of the repayment claim under the Notes including a
default of the Issuer, bad debt (Forderungsausfall) or a transfer of an impaired receivable to a third party
or from any other default can only be offset against other income from capital investments and only up to
an amount of €20,000 per year. Respective losses exceeding the amount of €20,000 can be carried forward
and might be set off in future tax periods (together with current capital investment losses of each such tax
period) up to an amount of €20,000 per year (the "Limitation on Loss Deduction"). Given the Limitation
on Loss Deduction will not be applied by the German Disbursing Agent holding the Notes in custody,
investors suffering losses which are subject to the Limitation on Loss Deduction are required to declare
such losses in their income tax return. Although the relevant amount has been increased from €10,000 to
€20,000, the constitutionality of the Limitation on Loss Deduction is still being debated. Therefore,
investors affected by the Limitation on Loss Deduction are advised to seek individual tax advice.

German withholding tax will be levied by a German Disbursing Agent at a flat withholding tax rate of
26.375% (including solidarity surcharge) plus, if applicable, church tax. Church tax, if applicable, will be
collected by the German Disbursing Agent by way of withholding unless the investor has filed a blocking
notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern). In the
latter case, the investor has to include the savings income in the tax return and will then be assessed to
church tax. Further, church tax is not collected by way of withholding if the investment income forms part
of income from trade business, self-employment, agriculture and forestry, or letting and leasing.

No German withholding tax will be levied if the investor has filed a withholding tax exemption certificate
(Freistellungsauftrag) with the German Disbursing Agent, but only to the extent the savings income does
not exceed the exemption amount shown on the withholding tax exemption certificate. Currently, the
maximum exemption amount is €1,000 (€2,000 in the case of jointly assessed spouses or registered life
partners). Similarly, no withholding tax will be levied if the investor has submitted a certificate of nonassessment (Nichtveranlagungs-Bescheinigung) issued by the relevant local tax office to the German
Disbursing Agent.


-----

The Issuer is not obliged to levy German withholding tax in respect of payments on the Notes.

**_Tax assessment_**

The taxation of savings income shall take place mainly by way of levying withholding tax (please see
above). If and to the extent German withholding tax has been levied, such withholding tax shall, in principle,
become definitive and replace the investor's income taxation. If no withholding tax has been levied other
than by virtue of a withholding tax exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) and in certain other cases,
the investor is nevertheless obliged to file a tax return, and the savings income will then be taxed within the
assessment procedure (Veranlagungsverfahren). If the investor is subject to church tax and has filed a
blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für
_Steuern), the investor is also obliged to include the savings income in the tax return for church tax purposes._

However, also in the assessment procedure, savings income is principally taxed at a separate tax rate for
savings income (gesonderter Steuertarif für Einkünfte aus Kapitalvermögen) being identical to the
withholding tax rate (26.375% - including solidarity surcharge (Solidaritätszuschlag) plus, if applicable,
church tax). In certain cases, the investor may apply to be assessed on the basis of its personal tax rate if
such rate is lower than the above tax rate. Such application can only be filed consistently for all savings
income within the assessment period. In case of jointly assessed spouses or registered life partners the
application can only be filed for savings income of both spouses/life partners.

When computing the savings income, the saver's lump sum amount (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €1,000
(€2,000 in the case of jointly assessed spouses or registered life partners) will be deducted. The deduction
of the actual income related expenses, if any, is excluded. That holds true even if the investor applies to be
assessed on the basis of its personal tax rate.

Where Notes form part of a trade or business, the withholding tax, if any, will not satisfy the personal or
corporate income tax liability. The respective holder must include income and related (business) expenses
in the annual tax return and the balance will be taxed at the holder's applicable tax rate. Withholding tax
levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the personal or corporate income tax liability of
the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability, be refunded. Where
Notes form part of a German trade or business the current income and gains from the disposal, redemption,
repayment or assignment of the Notes may also be subject to German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade
tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz). If the holder is an
individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely or partly
credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method.

**Certain European Taxation Considerations**

**_The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax ("FTT")_**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the "Commission's proposal") for
a directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria,
Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the "Participating Member States"). However, Estonia has since stated
that it will not participate.

The Commission's proposal has a very broad scope and could, if introduced in its current form, apply to
certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.

Under the Commission's proposal, FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and
outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where
at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member
State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, "established" in a Participating Member State in
a broad range of circumstances, including (i) by transacting with a person established in a Participating
Member State or (ii) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a
Participating Member State.

However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between Participating Member States. It may
therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU
Member States may decide to participate and/or certain of the Participating Member States may decide to
withdraw.


-----

At the ECOFIN Council meeting of June 14, 2019, a state of play of the work on the FTT was presented
on the basis of a note prepared by Germany on June 7, 2019 indicating a consensus among the Participating
Member States (excluding Estonia) to continue negotiations on the basis of a joint French-German proposal
based on the French financial transactions tax model which in principle would only concern shares of listed
companies whose head office is in a Member State of the European Union. However, such proposal is still
subject to change until a final approval.

Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**Certain French Taxation Considerations**

The following is a general description of certain French withholding tax considerations relating to the
holding of Notes. This description is based on the assumptions that the Notes would not be redeemed by
delivery or transfer of share(s). It is not a description of general French tax considerations relating to the
Notes. Prospective investors are advised to consult their own professional advisors to obtain information
about the tax consequences of the subscription, acquisition, ownership, or disposition of the Notes. Only
personal advisors are in a position to adequately take into account special tax aspects of the Notes as well
as the Note holder's personal circumstances and any special tax treatment applicable to the Note holder.
This description is based on French law as in force when drawing up this offering memorandum. The laws
and their interpretation by the tax authorities may change and such changes may have retroactive effect.

**_Taxation of payments under the Guarantee made by a Guarantor established in France_**

There is no case law or official guidance from the French tax authorities in respect of payments made under
a guarantee. There is therefore some uncertainty as to the precise tax qualification applicable in France to
such payments.

In accordance with one interpretation of French tax law, payments made under a Guarantee by a Guarantor
established in France are to be treated as payments in lieu of payments to be made on the Notes by the
Issuer. Accordingly, under this interpretation, payments to be made by a Guarantor established in France
under a Guarantee should not be subject to withholding taxes in France to the extent that payments made
or to be made by the Issuer would not be subject to withholding taxes in France by reason of it not being
resident of, or otherwise established in France.

In accordance with another interpretation of French tax law, payments made under a Guarantee by a
Guarantor established in France are to be treated as payments independent from the payments to be made
under the Notes by the Issuer. Accordingly, and in the absence of any specific provision to the contrary in
the French Code général des impôts, such payments should be out of the scope from withholding taxes in
France.

Alternatively, payments made under a Guarantee by a Guarantor established in France could be treated as
French-source payments of interest for French tax purposes. Under this interpretation, payments to be made
by a Guarantor established in France under a Guarantee should not be subject to withholding taxes in France
to the extent that payments are not made in a non-cooperative jurisdiction within the meaning of Article
238-0 A of the French _Code général des impôts (a "Non-Cooperative Jurisdiction") other than those_
mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of such Article 238-0 A nor to a person domiciled or established in such a NonCooperative Jurisdiction

Other interpretations, which may lead to a different treatment under French tax law, cannot be ruled out.

In the unlikely circumstances where payments made by a Guarantor established in France under the
Guarantee are regarded as payments made by a person who carries on a business in France to a person who
has no permanent professional installation (installation professionnelle permanente) in France in
consideration for services (whatever their nature) supplied or used in France, such payments could be
subject to withholding tax in France pursuant to Article 182 B of the French Code général des impôts,
subject to the more favorable provisions of an applicable double treaty.

**_Taxation of payments of interest and assimilated revenue made by the Issuer in respect of the Notes_**

On the basis that the Issuer is not and will not be viewed as being a French tax resident and any transactions
in connection with the Notes are not and will not be attributed or attributable to a French branch, permanent
establishment or other fixed place of business of the Issuer, payments of interest and assimilated revenues


-----

by the Issuer under the Notes will not be viewed as French source income and therefore will not be subject
to withholding taxes in France, in accordance with the applicable French law.

By exception, pursuant to Article 125 A I of the French Code général des impôts, and subject to certain
exceptions, where the paying agent is established in France, interest and assimilated revenue received by
French tax resident individuals are subject to a 12.8% mandatory (non-final) withholding tax. If applicable,
this withholding tax is creditable against the applicable personal income tax liability in respect of the year
in which the payment has been made. If the withholding tax paid exceeds the total amount of personal
income tax due, the excess will be refunded. Such interest and assimilated revenue are also subject to French
social contributions by way of a withholding at the aggregate rate of 17.2% (CSG of 9.2%, the prélèvement
_de solidarité sur les revenus du patrimoine et produits de placement of 7.5% and the_ _CRDS of 0.5%),_
subject to certain exceptions.

Other rules may apply where the paying agent is not established in France.

Prospective purchasers of Notes should be aware that transactions involving the Notes, including any
purchase or disposal of, or other dealings in, the Notes, may have French tax consequences. The tax
consequences regarding interest, premium on redemption and capital gains in particular may depend,
amongst other things, upon the status of the prospective purchaser (i.e., legal entities or individuals).
Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their own tax advisers about the French tax implications
of purchasing, holding, disposing the Notes and more generally of any transactions involving Notes.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following summary discusses certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition,
ownership and disposition of the Notes. Except as specifically noted below, this discussion applies only to
Notes purchased on original issuance at the issue price on the cover of this Offering Memorandum, which
are held as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes (generally, property held for investment) by
U.S. Holders (as defined below).

This discussion does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant in light of a U.S. Holder's
particular circumstances or to U.S. Holders subject to special rules, such as:

- financial institutions;

- insurance companies;

- dealers in securities or foreign currencies;

- regulated investment companies;

- real estate investment trusts;

- tax exempt organizations;

- persons holding Notes as part of a hedging transaction, "straddle," conversion transaction or other
integrated transaction;

- certain former citizens and residents of the United States;

- U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

- persons liable for alternative minimum tax;

- persons required for U.S. federal income tax purposes to accelerate the recognition of any item of
gross income with respect to the Notes on as a result of such income being recognized on an
applicable financial statement; or

- entities or arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If an entity or arrangement that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes invests
in Notes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner


-----

and upon the activities of the partnership. Partnerships considering an investment in the Notes should
consult their own tax advisers regarding the tax consequences of their investment.

This summary is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended to the date hereof (the "Code"),
administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final, temporary and proposed U.S. Treasury
Regulations, changes to any of which subsequent to the date of this Offering Memorandum may affect the
tax consequences described below, possibly on a retroactive basis. No ruling will be sought from the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") with respect to any statement in this discussion and there can be no
assurance that the IRS will not challenge such statements, or, if challenged, that a court will uphold such
statements.

This discussion does not address any other U.S. federal income tax laws (such as the Medicare contribution
tax on net investment income). Persons considering the purchase of the Notes should consult their own tax
advisers with regard to the application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to their particular situations, as
well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non- U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

As used herein, the term "U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of a Note that is for U.S. federal income
tax purposes:

- a citizen or individual resident of the United States;

- a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or
the District of Columbia;

- an estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its
source.

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

Based on certain terms of the Notes, it is possible that the IRS could assert that the Notes are properly
treated as contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Issuer does not
intend to treat the Notes as contingent payment debt instruments, and the discussion below assumes that
the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The Issuer's determination is binding on a U.S. Holder unless such U.S. Holder discloses its contrary
position in the manner required by applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations. The Issuer's determination is not
binding on the IRS, however, and if the IRS were to successfully challenge the determination, adverse U.S.
federal income tax consequences could apply to U.S. Holder and in the event contingent payments were to
occur, characterization of the Notes as contingent payment debt instruments would also affect the amount,
character, and timing of the income recognized by a U.S. Holder. U.S. Holders should consult their own
tax advisors regarding the potential treatment of the Notes as contingent payment debt instruments for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Payments of stated interest on the Notes (including additional amounts paid in respect of non-U.S.
withholding taxes and without reduction for non-U.S. tax withheld, if any) generally will be taxable to a
U.S. Holder as foreign-source ordinary income at the time that such payments are received or accrued, in
accordance with such U.S. Holder's method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

A U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be required
to include, in ordinary income, the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment (translated at the spot rate
of exchange on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted
to U.S. dollars. A cash basis U.S. Holder will not realize exchange gain or loss on the receipt of the interest
income, but it may recognize exchange gain or loss upon the actual disposition of the euro received.

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be
required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the amount of interest income in the euro that has
accrued during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such accrued income will be determined by
translating such income at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an
accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate for the partial period within the U.S.
Holder's taxable year. A U.S. Holder may elect, however, to translate such accrued interest income using
the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that


-----

spans two taxable years, using the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the portion of the accrual period
within the U.S. Holder's taxable year. If the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the
date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. Holder may translate such interest at the spot rate on the date
of receipt. The above election will apply to other obligations held by the U.S. Holder and may not be
changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S.
federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income
on the date such interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the
difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro received (translated at the spot rate on the date
such payment is received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of interest income that
has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact
converted to U.S. dollars. Such gain or loss will generally constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

If the issue price of the Notes is less than their principal amount by more than a de minimis amount, U.S.
Holders will be subject to special U.S. federal income tax rules with respect to this original issue discount
("OID"). OID will be considered to be de minimis if it is less than 0.25% of the principal amount multiplied
_by the number of complete years to stated maturity. U.S. Holders will be required to include any OID in_
income for U.S. federal tax purposes as it accrues in accordance with a constant yield method based on a
compounding of interest, even though the cash attributable to this income will not be received until the
Notes are sold, exchanged or retired. OID on the Notes generally would be accrued in the euro in a manner
similar to accruals of interest by accrual method taxpayers discussed above. U.S. Holders should consult
their own tax advisers concerning how to account for any OID that may accrue on the Notes.

U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding how to account for payments made or received
in euro.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**

A U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other
taxable disposition of the Notes in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar amount
realized on such disposition (less any amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will
be taxable as interest income to the extent not previously included in income) and the U.S. Holder's adjusted
basis in the Notes. A U.S. Holder's adjusted basis in a Note will be determined by reference to the U.S.
dollar cost of the Note and increased for any accruals of OID.

A U.S. Holder will recognize U.S. source exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) on the
sale, exchange, redemption or other disposition of the Note equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S.
dollar values of the U.S. Holder's purchase price for the Note in euro measured on (i) the date of sale,
exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition and (ii) the date on which the U.S. Holder
acquired the Note. Any such exchange gain or loss will be realized only to the extent of total gain or loss
realized on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition (including any exchange
gain or loss with respect to the receipt of accrued but unpaid interest). Any additional gain or loss realized
on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition generally will be U.S. source
capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of the sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition, the Notes have been held for more than one year. Long-term capital
gains recognized by a non-corporate holder generally are subject to tax at a lower rate than short-term
capital gains or ordinary income. The deduction of capital losses is subject to limitations.

U.S. Holders should consult their tax own advisers regarding how to account for payments made or received
in a currency other than the U.S. dollar.

**_IPO Pushdown_**

If there is an IPO Pushdown, the Notes could be treated as being exchanged for new Notes for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. If the Notes are treated as being exchanged in this manner, the deemed exchange
would generally be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. Holders. Furthermore, the "new" Notes could
be deemed to be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In that event,
U.S. holders would be required to include the original issue discount in their income as it accrues, regardless
of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. holders should consult


-----

their tax advisers regarding the potential impact to them of an IPO Pushdown in their particular
circumstances.

**_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_**

Information returns may be filed with the IRS in connection with payments of principal and interest in
respect of, and the proceeds from sales, redemption or other disposition of, Notes held by a U.S. Holder
unless the U.S. Holder establishes, if required, that it is exempt from the information reporting rules, for
example, by properly establishing that it is a corporation. If the U.S. Holder does not establish that it is
exempt from these rules, the U.S. Holder may be subject to backup withholding on these payments if it fails
to provide a taxpayer identification number or otherwise comply with the backup withholding rules. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax, and the amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S.
Holder will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. Holder's U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle
the U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Reporting and Filing Requirements_**

U.S. Holders should consult their advisers regarding any additional tax reporting or filing requirements
they may have as a result of the acquisition, ownership or disposition of the Notes, including requirements
related to the holding of certain foreign financial assets or foreign currency losses. Failure to comply with
certain reporting obligations could result in the imposition of substantial penalties.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

**Overview**

The U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), imposes
requirements on "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA that are subject to
Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, such as pension plans, retirement plans, profit-sharing plans, 401(k)
plans, health and welfare plans, medical plans, certain voluntary employee's beneficiary associations and
certain look-through entities, such as tax-exempt group trusts, common or collective trust funds of banks,
collective investment funds, and insurance company separate accounts whose underlying assets include the
assets of such employee benefit plans, certain insurance company general accounts, separately managed
accounts whose underlying assets include the assets of such employee benefit plans and other funds and
investment vehicles that are treated as holding plan assets because of plans' investment in the entities (each,
an "ERISA Plan"), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. ERISA also
imposes limits on transactions between ERISA Plans and the ERISA Plan's service providers or other
related parties.

Each fiduciary of an ERISA Plan should consider ERISA and the regulations and guidance thereunder when
considering an investment in the Notes. Fiduciaries of ERISA Plans, as well as other "plans" and other
retirement arrangements within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code that are subject to Section
4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts or "Keogh" plans, and other entities whose
underlying assets include plan assets by reason of any such plan's investment in the entities (together with
an ERISA Plan, a "Plan"), should also consider, among other items, the issues described below when
considering an investment in the Notes.

**_Fiduciary Duty of Investing ERISA Plans_**

When evaluating the prudence of an investment, the ERISA Plan's fiduciary should consider the U.S.
Department of Labor regulation on investment duties. Under ERISA, a person who exercises discretionary
authority or control regarding the management or disposition of an ERISA Plan's assets is generally
considered a fiduciary of such an ERISA Plan. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA's general
fiduciary requirements, which should be considered with regards to each ERISA Plan's particular facts and
circumstances. For example, when considering an investment in the Notes with an ERISA Plan's assets, the
ERISA Plan's fiduciary would typically determine, particularly in light of the risks and limited liquidity
inherent in an investment in the Notes, whether the investment in the Notes would (i) satisfy the
diversification requirements of Section 404(a)(1)(C) of ERISA, (ii) be in accordance with the documents
and instruments governing the ERISA Plan pursuant to Section 404(a)(1)(D) of ERISA and (iii) be prudent
with respect to the structure and nature of the Offering.

In addition, ERISA requires an ERISA Plan's fiduciary to maintain indicia of ownership for the ERISA
Plan's assets within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal District Courts. While it is not intended that the
Issuer's underlying assets will be "plan assets," there can be no assurance that, notwithstanding the Issuer's
commercially reasonable efforts, the Issuer's underlying assets will not otherwise be deemed to include
"plan assets" for the purposes of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. In any event, the Issuer is
not accepting any appointment, conditional or otherwise, as a fiduciary to an investing ERISA Plan.
Fiduciaries of ERISA Plans should also consider ERISA's rules relating to delegation of control.

ERISA Plans investing in the Notes may be required to report compensation, including indirect
compensation, paid in connection with the ERISA Plan's investment on Schedule C of Form 5500 (Annual
Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan). The descriptions in this Offering Memorandum of services
provided to stockholders, management fees, incentive fees, ancillary fees, direct fees, other fees and direct
compensation paid by stockholders and any indirect compensation and commissions earned by the Issuer
and the Initial Purchasers in respect of an investment in the Notes, including the fees paid to the Issuer, the
Initial Purchasers and the payor, are intended to satisfy the disclosure requirement for "eligible indirect
compensation," for which an alternative reporting procedure on Schedule C of Form 5500 may be available.

Fiduciaries of ERISA Plans should consider whether an investment in the Notes might constitute or give
rise to a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.


-----

**Prohibited Transaction**

"Governmental plans" within the meaning of Section 3(32) of ERISA, "church plans" within the meaning
of Section 3(33) of ERISA that have made no election under Section 410(d) of the Code and non-U.S. plans
described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA, are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited
transaction provisions of Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code but may
nevertheless be subject to a U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. law or regulation that contains one or more
provisions that are substantially similar to the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code ("Similar Law").

**_Representations and Warranties_**

Each prospective investor in the Notes (or any interest therein) will be deemed to have acknowledged,
represented and agreed by its purchase or holding of the Notes (or any interest therein), that it is not, and it
is not acting on behalf of or using the assets of, and for so long as it holds the Notes (or any interest therein)
will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of or using the assets of, (a) a Plan or (b) a governmental,
church or non-U.S. plan that is subject to any applicable Similar Law.

Any purported transfer of the Notes (or any interest therein) in violation of the requirements set forth in
these paragraphs shall be null and void ab initio, and the Issuer will have the right to compel any transferee
acquiring the Notes (or any interest therein) in violation of the requirements set forth in these paragraphs
to sell such Notes (or any interest therein) or to sell such Notes (or any interest therein) on behalf of such
transferee.

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND**
**THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a summary of certain insolvency law considerations in the jurisdictions in which the Issuer_
_and certain subsidiaries are incorporated or organized, and a summary of certain limitations on the validity_
_and enforceability of the security interests for the Notes. The description is only a summary and does not_
_purport to be complete or to discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity and_
_enforceability of the Notes, any future Guarantee or the security interests. Prospective investors in the_
_Notes should consult their own legal advisers with respect to such limitations and considerations._

**European Union**

**_Regime Applicable to Insolvency Proceedings Opened after June 26, 2017_**

On June 5, 2015, Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20,
2015 on insolvency proceedings (the "Recast EU Insolvency Regulation") was published on the Official
Gazette of the European Union.

The Recast EU Insolvency Regulation is applicable to insolvency proceedings opened after June 26, 2017.
Insolvency proceedings opened before June 26, 2017 are subject to Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 on
insolvency proceedings (the "Insolvency Regulation 2000"). The Recast EU Insolvency Regulation
applies to insolvency proceedings opened in respect of a company whose "centre of main interests" is
located in a Member State (other than Denmark).

_Main Insolvency Proceedings_

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to
open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark)
within which the center of a debtor's main interests is situated. The "centre of main interests" is defined as
"the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is
ascertainable by third parties." Article 3(1), paragraph 2, provides for a rebuttable presumption, whereby
in the case of a company it is assumed that its "centre of main interests" is in the jurisdiction of the place
of its registered office. In order to prevent fraudulent or abusive forum shopping, such presumption only
applies if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period
prior to the request of the opening of insolvency proceedings. Otherwise, the presumption shall not apply
and the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company will be
the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) within which the company had its registered office
before moving it. If the "centre of main interests" of a company is and will remain located in the state in
which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the
Recast EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and, accordingly, a court in
such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A
to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation. Pursuant to Preamble 10, Annex A has been extended to include
insolvency proceedings previously not falling within the scope of the Insolvency Regulation 2000 in order
to promote the rescue of economically viable but financially distressed businesses. Furthermore, pursuant
to Article 6 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of
which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for
any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as
avoidance actions.

_Secondary Insolvency Proceedings_

Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation are to be
recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be
opened in other Member States. If the "centre of main interests" of a debtor is in one Member State (other
than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member
State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open "secondary" or "territorial" insolvency proceedings
only in the event that such debtor has an "establishment" in the territory of such other Member State.
"Establishment" is defined as any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the
three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic
activity with human means and assets. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets
of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State.


-----

However, under Article 36 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings may prevent the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member
State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which
secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened. For this purpose, the insolvency practitioner must
undertake to comply with the distribution and priority rights under the relevant national law and from which
the local creditors would benefit if the insolvency proceeding was opened in the Member State were the
assets are located. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a majority of
local creditors, determined in accordance with applicable local laws. If approved, the undertaking is binding
on the insolvent estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it should refuse
to open such proceeding if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of
local creditors. Pursuant to Article 4 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open
insolvency proceedings will be required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3; such
decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction.

_Insolvency Proceedings Involving Members of a Group of Companies_

The Recast EU Insolvency Regulation provides for a cooperation and communication mechanism in the
event that insolvency proceedings concerning two or more members of a group of companies are opened.
Insolvency practitioners appointed in proceedings concerning a member of the Group shall cooperate with
any insolvency practitioner appointed in proceedings concerning another member of the Group to the extent
that such cooperation is appropriate. Similarly, the court which has opened proceedings shall also cooperate
with any other court before which a request is made to open proceedings concerning another member of
the Group to the extent that cooperation is appropriate to facilitate the effective administration of the
proceedings, is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them and does not entail any conflict of interest.
In this respect, the courts may, where appropriate, appoint a third party, _provided that_ this is not
incompatible with the rules applicable to them.

_Applicability_

In the event that the Issuer or any its subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict
with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability
of the obligations of the Issuer.

**Austria**

**_Insolvency_**

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Austrian insolvency law. The law relating to
insolvency is regulated by the Austrian Insolvency Act (Insolvenzordnung, IO). The Austrian Insolvency
Act regulates (i) bankruptcy proceedings (Konkursverfahren), in which the debtor's assets or business as a
whole are sold and the proceeds are distributed among its creditors, after the deduction of the costs of the
proceedings and the insolvency administrator, and (ii) recovery proceedings (Sanierungsverfahren), which
enable the debtor to discharge its liabilities through quota payments and to continue its activities under
certain conditions. Creditors' rights might also be affected by the Austrian Business Reorganization Act
(Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz) and the Austrian Restructuring Code (Restrukturierungsordnung),
which do not govern insolvency proceedings but regulate the reorganization or restructuring of companies
in financial distress. See "Business Reorganization Proceedings" and "Restructuring Proceedings."

With respect to the Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Austria (the "Austrian Guarantor"), a
rebuttable presumption exists that it also has its "centre of main interests," as defined in the Recast EU
Insolvency Regulation, in Austria. In the event of an insolvency of a company having its "centre of main
interests" in Austria, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Austria. Such proceedings will be governed
by Austrian law (for example, if the "centre of main interests" of such company is in Austria or if such
company has an "establishment" in the territory of the Republic of Austria or, where the Recast EU
Insolvency Regulation does not apply, also if such company has assets in Austria). Under certain
circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Austria in accordance with Austrian law with
respect to the assets of companies that are not organized under Austrian law.

Insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzverfahren) are opened by a court if the debtor is insolvent, provided that
the insolvency estate's value is sufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. A debtor


-----

is insolvent in the case of (i) illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) (i.e., the debtor is unable to pay its debts as
and when they fall due) or (ii) over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) (i.e., the debtor's liabilities exceed the
liquidation value of its assets in combination with a negative prognosis on its ability to continue as a going
concern (negative Fortbestehensprognose)), each within the meaning of the Austrian Insolvency Act.
Under Austrian law, insolvency proceedings may be initiated either by the debtor or a creditor by filing an
application to that effect with a court of competent jurisdiction. If insolvency proceedings are initiated upon
a creditor's request, such creditor will have to show that the debtor is illiquid or over-indebted. A court may
also open recovery proceedings (Sanierungsverfahren), if the risk of the debtor's inability to pay its debts
is at least imminent (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and the debtor files an application for the opening of
such proceedings.

The debtor is obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay upon
insolvency. If it is evident that an insolvency cannot be avoided, the debtor is obliged to file for insolvency
immediately. If the debtor undertakes promising and realistic measures to stabilize or reverse insolvency,
the debtor has a maximum period of 60 days to file. If the debtor's illiquidity is caused by a natural disaster,
which includes floods, avalanches, snow pressures, landslides, hurricanes, earthquakes, or, in response to
the COVID-19 pandemic, pandemics, epidemics, or similar disasters of comparable magnitude, the
Austrian Insolvency Act allows the debtor 120 days to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Depending on whether the debtor submits an acceptable recovery plan (Sanierungsplan) together with the
application for the opening of insolvency proceedings, the initiated insolvency proceedings may be in the
form of recovery proceedings (Sanierungsverfahren) or bankruptcy proceedings (Konkursverfahren), both
of which are governed by the provisions of the Austrian Insolvency Act (not the Austrian Restructuring
Code). If the debtor has applied for the opening of insolvency proceedings in the form of recovery
proceedings and has submitted to the court an acceptable recovery plan (Sanierungsplan) that offers a
recovery rate of at least 20% to the unsecured creditors payable within a maximum period of two years, the
court initiates insolvency proceedings in the form of recovery proceedings. If the conditions for recovery
proceedings are not met, the insolvency court initiates bankruptcy proceedings. The legal provisions
regulating recovery proceedings do not apply to bankruptcy proceedings.

A debtor may also submit a recovery plan in the course of bankruptcy proceedings that are already in
progress; however, if the recovery plan is presented after the opening of the proceedings, the relevant
proceedings will continue to be designated as bankruptcy proceedings.

In order for the debtor's recovery plan to be approved by the court, it must meet certain criteria specified
by insolvency law.

A recovery plan generally intends to discharge the debtor from a portion of its debts (up to 80%) and to
enable the debtor to continue its business activities. The recovery plan requires the approval of a "qualified
majority" of the debtor's unsecured creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) to become effective (i.e., the majority of
all unsecured creditors present and entitled to vote at the hearing (by headcount) (Kopfmehrheit), provided
that the total sum of these creditors' claims amounts to more than 50% of the aggregate amount of all claims
of the unsecured creditors present and entitled to vote at the hearing (Kapitalmehrheit)). Once the debtor
has complied with the terms of a recovery plan that was duly approved by the creditors and confirmed by
the court, it will be released from its remaining outstanding unsecured debts. Unsecured creditors whose
claims under the recovery plan have not been satisfied in accordance with the plan's terms may enforce
their individual claims against the debtor. In case the recovery plan is not approved by the creditors, the
insolvency proceedings will be continued as bankruptcy proceedings.

If the recovery proceedings have been initiated and the debtor has submitted qualified documents together
with a recovery plan that offers a recovery rate of at least 30% to the unsecured creditors payable over a
maximum of two years after the approval of such recovery plan, the debtor qualifies for self-administration
(Sanierungsverfahren mit Eigenverwaltung unter Aufsicht eines Verwalters). The self-administration may
be withdrawn, if, for example, negative effects on the creditors' positions can be expected.

Unless the debtor qualifies for self-administration, the debtor may no longer dispose of the assets belonging
to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) as of the opening of the insolvency proceedings. The opening of
insolvency proceedings takes effect on the day following the publication of the court's order opening such
proceedings in the official online database of Austrian insolvencies (www.edikte.justiz.gv.at). After the
opening of insolvency proceedings (and unless the debtor qualifies for self-administration), transactions of


-----

the debtor with respect to assets belonging to the insolvency estate have no effect against the creditors of
the insolvency estate.

With its decision to open the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator
(Insolvenzverwalter), and may, depending on the nature and the size of the debtor's business (either _ex_
_officio or upon the request of the creditors' meeting (Gläubigerversammlung)), appoint a creditors'_
committee (Gläubigerausschuss) charged with monitoring and assisting the insolvency administrator in the
discharge of its duties. After the opening of insolvency proceedings (and unless the debtor qualifies for
self-administration) only the insolvency administrator is entitled to act on behalf of the insolvency estate.

Under Austrian law, an insolvency administrator's role is to continue the debtor's business with a view to
enabling a potential reorganization of the debtor's business either by implementing the debtor's recovery
plan or by a (partial) sale of the debtor's business. If neither a recovery plan nor a (partial) sale of the debtor's
business is possible, the insolvency administrator will discontinue the debtor's business operations. As a
result of the ensuing bankruptcy proceedings, the debtor's assets will be liquidated and the proceeds realized
thereby will be distributed to the debtor's creditors, with the debtor remaining liable for any portion of its
debts not satisfied by such proceeds (to the extent the debtor is not granted a haircut by the Austrian
Insolvency Act).

If the debtor qualifies for self-administration, the court will proceed with the appointment of a recovery
administrator (Sanierungsverwalter) to monitor the activities of the debtor. In such case, certain
transactions are either subject to the recovery administrator's approval or may be performed only by the
recovery administrator.

Unsecured creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) wishing to assert their claims against the debtor must participate
in the insolvency proceedings and must file their claims with the competent court within the time period
prescribed by the court order regarding the opening of insolvency proceedings. At the so-called examination
hearing (Prüfungstagsatzung), which is held at the competent court, the insolvency administrator must
declare, in respect of each of the claims filed with the court, whether the insolvency administrator
acknowledges or contests the claim. If the insolvency administrator acknowledges a creditor's claim, such
creditor will be entitled to participate in the insolvency proceedings and the pro rata distribution of the
insolvency quota (Insolvenzquote) to unsecured creditors that will follow. If the insolvency administrator
contests a creditor's claim, the creditor will have to seek enforcement of its claim in civil proceedings and
only then participate in the insolvency proceedings.

In the insolvency proceedings, claims of unsecured creditors that were created before the opening of the
proceedings (Insolvenzforderungen) rank _pari passu with each other. Certain claims that lawfully arise_
against the insolvency estate after the opening of the proceedings (including the costs of the insolvency
proceedings), so-called privileged claims (Masseforderungen), enjoy priority in the insolvency proceedings
and rank prior to all other unsecured claims. Claims that are secured by in rem security (such as by a pledge),
so-called preferential claims (Absonderungsrechte), are entitled to preferential payment in the distribution
of the proceeds resulting from the realization of the charged asset. Creditors who have a right to preferential
treatment may participate in the pro rata distribution to the unsecured creditors only to the extent that the
proceeds from the realization of the assets charged to them did not cover their claims or if they have waived
their right to preferential treatment. Secured creditors do not have a voting right with respect to the approval
of the recovery plan to the extent their claim is covered by security. Claims relating to the payment of taxes,
social security contributions and employee compensation are not, as such, privileged or preferential claims
under Austrian law. Claims of creditors with a right of segregation of assets (Aussonderungsberechtigte),
such as creditors with a retention of title or trustors (Treugeber), remain unaffected by the opening of
insolvency proceedings. However, according to the Austrian Insolvency Act, a request for preferential
realization (Absonderung) of pledged assets of a debtor that are essential for the continuation of the debtor's
business or the exercise of a right of segregation of assets (Aussonderungsrecht) in relation to such assets
cannot be made within a period of six months from the opening of insolvency proceedings, unless, inter
_alia, the preferential realization (Absonderung) of pledged assets is necessary to prevent the contractual_
counterparty from incurring severe personal or economic damages.

Once insolvency proceedings have been opened, it is no longer possible to obtain an execution lien with
respect to assets belonging to the insolvency estate. All execution proceedings against the debtor are subject
to an automatic stay (Vollstreckungssperre). Execution liens obtained within the last 60 days before the
opening of insolvency proceedings expire upon the opening of such insolvency proceedings (subject to
certain exemptions), unless the insolvency proceedings are terminated because the insolvency estate is


-----

insufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Execution liens obtained within the
last twelve months may be subject to voidance law.

The Austrian Insolvency Act provides that, for a period of six months from the opening of insolvency
proceedings, contractual counterparties of the debtor may only terminate contracts for cause (subject to
certain exemptions). In this context, the deterioration of the economic situation or the lack of timely
performance by the debtor prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings is not considered as sufficient
cause. This restriction only applies if the termination of a contract would jeopardize the continuation of the
debtor's business. No restrictions apply if the termination of a contract is necessary to prevent the
contractual counterparty from incurring severe personal or economic damage.

Further, the Austrian Insolvency Act provides that a contractual provision that entitles the other party to
withdraw from an agreement or that provides for automatic termination in the event of the opening of
insolvency proceedings is not enforceable (subject to certain exemptions for certain derivatives and other
financial transactions).

Powers of attorney granted by the insolvent debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective
upon the opening of insolvency proceedings.

**_Business Reorganization Proceedings_**

The rights of creditors may also be affected by the Austrian Business Reorganization Act
(Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz, URG). The Austrian Business Reorganization Act regulates the
reorganization of companies in temporary financial distress in order to enable them to continue to do
business after having undergone a reorganization procedure. The Austrian Business Reorganisation Act is
therefore not designed to assist creditors in satisfying their claims, but rather to support the reorganization
of the debtor's business. A business reorganization procedure may be opened if a substantial and sustainable
deterioration of the quota of own funds (Eigenmittelquote) may be certifiably anticipated. Only the debtor
may apply for the opening of a reorganization procedure, provided, however, that it is not insolvent at the
time of its application. Failure to timely apply for the opening of reorganization proceedings may result in
personal liability of the representatives of the relevant corporation. A company is deemed to be in need of
reorganization if it has (i) a quota of own funds (Eigenmittelquote) of less than 8% and a fictitious duration
of debt repayment (fiktive Schuldentilgungsdauer) of more than 15 years, each as defined in, and determined
in accordance with, the Austrian Business Reorganization Act. Pursuant to the Austrian Business
Reorganization Act, a contractual provision that entitles the other party to withdraw from an agreement or
that provides for its automatic termination or the maturity of a disbursed loan facility in the event of the
opening of reorganization proceedings is not permissible.

**_Restructuring Proceedings_**

The Restructuring Directive has been transposed into Austrian law through the Austrian Restructuring Code
(Restrukturierungsordnung, ReO), which entered into force on July 17, 2021. Legal entities and natural
persons, insofar as they operate a business, may apply for restructuring proceedings
(Restrukturierungsverfahren) as debtors if insolvency is probable (wahrscheinliche Insolvenz). Insolvency
is considered probable, if the existence of the debtor's business would be at risk without restructuring,
especially if illiquidity is imminent (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit). Probable insolvency is presumed if
the quota of own funds (Eigenmittelquote) is less than 8% and the fictitious duration of debt repayment
(fiktive Schuldentilgungsdauer) is more than 15 years. Restructuring proceedings may only be opened upon
application by the debtor. The debtor must show the existence of probable insolvency in the application.

The Austrian Restructuring Code generally provides for the debtor's self-administration for the conduct of
the proceedings. However, the court may prohibit the debtor from performing certain legal acts during the
ongoing proceedings without the consent of the court or a court-appointed restructuring administrator.

The core of the restructuring proceedings is the restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan). In this plan, the
debtor must present concise restructuring measures, the duration and the effects of the restructuring. It must
also contain a financial plan, a conditional going concern forecast and a comparative calculation of
insolvency scenarios. In the restructuring plan, the debtor must present a proposal for the effects of the
restructuring, in particular the intended haircut on the various creditor classes. The following creditor
classes may be included in the plan: (i) secured creditors, (ii) unsecured creditors, (iii) bondholders,
(iv) creditors in need of protection (with claims of less than €10,000), and (v) subordinated creditors. A


-----

majority of the affected creditors (present at the meeting) in each class (head majority) and a capital majority
of 75% of the affected creditors (present at the meeting) in each class are required to adopt the restructuring
plan. If a restructuring plan is approved by the required majorities, it must also be confirmed by the court.
If a class of creditors rejects the restructuring plan, the court may nevertheless confirm the restructuring
plan at the debtor's request in a cross-class cramdown. A rejecting creditor may apply for a review of the
plan as to whether such creditor would be worse off as a result of the restructuring plan than in an alternative
insolvency proceeding. If such a request has been made, the court may only confirm an accepted
restructuring plan if this test shows that creditors are better off with the restructuring plan.

Amongst other things, the exercise of rights and their enforcement may be restricted under the Austrian
Reorganization Act. For example, and without limitation, (i) upon the acceptance and confirmation of a
restructuring plan, claims may be restructured (e.g., by way of a payment deferral (Stundung) or a reduction
in the value of the relevant claims (Forderungskürzung)) even without the consent of or against the affected
creditors, subject to certain conditions to be met, (ii) during restructuring proceedings, individual
enforcement actions may be stayed (Vollstreckungssperre) for a period of three up to a maximum of six
months, and (iii) during restructuring proceedings, subject to certain conditions to be met and exceptions
(e.g., for certain derivatives and other financial transactions), creditors may not withhold performance or
terminate, accelerate or otherwise modify material contracts yet to be performed (wesentliche noch zu
_erfüllende Verträge) to the detriment of the relevant debtor on the basis of a contractual clause providing_
for such measures solely by reason of, for example, the opening of restructuring proceedings or the
fulfilment of the requirements for the opening of restructuring proceedings.

Shareholders are subject to a general obligation not to unreasonably prevent restructuring measures.
However, shareholders cannot form a class in a restructuring plan in relation to their equity stake in a
company, with the consequence that there is no possibility to outvote shareholders in a cross-class cramdown. Therefore, a restructuring plan cannot interfere with their legal and economic position against their
will and, for example, a debt-equity swap is not enforceable against the will of the shareholders.

New financing included in a court-approved restructuring plan or interim financing approved by the court
as well as other transactions closely related to the restructuring (especially those necessary for the
continuation of the business) shall only be subject to limited avoidance actions in possible subsequent
insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzverfahren). In particular, avoidance protection applies if the opposing
party did not know about the debtor's illiquidity.

The Austrian Reorganization Act also provides for a simplified fast-track restructuring procedure, which
can be used by the debtor if only financial creditors will be subject to the proposed restructuring measures.
In such a simplified procedure, the debtor remains entirely in possession (no court-appointed restructuring
administrator is appointed). Further, creditors are not required to vote on a restructuring plan in a court
hearing. Instead, the debtor submits to the court a restructuring agreement that has already been signed by
at least a 75% majority of the aggregate amount of claims in each class of financial creditors (no majority
based on headcount is required). Ultimately, such a restructuring agreement may be approved by the court
without the initiation of formal restructuring proceedings. Thus, it is also not possible to apply for an
enforcement stay in these fast-track proceedings. A cross-class cram-down will most likely not be possible
in such proceedings.

Restructuring proceedings pursuant to the Austrian Reorganization Act, which do not qualify as European
restructuring proceedings (Europäisches _Restrukturierungsverfahren), are not published in publicly_
available registers or data bases.

**_Appointment of a Trustee (Kurator)_**

In the event that the rights of the noteholders are put at risk due to lack of joint representation, a court of
competent jurisdiction (Kuratelgericht) may appoint a trustee (Kurator) to represent the interests of all
noteholders in matters concerning their collective rights (gemeinsame Rechte) pursuant to the Austrian
Notes Trustee Act (Kuratorengesetz) and the Austrian Notes Trustee Supplementation Act
(Kuratorenergänzungsgesetz). In particular, this may be the case if insolvency proceedings are opened (see
the discussion on "centre of main interests" above). Such a court-appointed trustee may be appointed upon
the request of an interested party (e.g., a noteholder) or upon the initiative of the competent court in case of
insolvency. The court-appointed trustee has the exclusive right to exercise the collective rights of the
noteholders on their behalf. Consequently, an individual noteholder may not bring individual action unless
the matter concerns a special relationship between such individual noteholder and the issuer. Noteholders


-----

are not able to direct the actions taken on their behalf by the court-appointed trustee. The powers of the
court-appointed trustee to exercise the collective rights of the noteholders would deprive the noteholders
and the trustee for the Notes of their ability to exercise their rights under the transaction documents,
including their rights to enforce the Note Guarantees under the Notes.

**_Equity Replacing Shareholder Loans_**

The Austrian Act on Equity Replacements (Eigenkapitalersatzgesetz) contains detailed provisions
regarding equity replacing shareholder loans. In particular, it provides that a loan granted by a (direct or
indirect) shareholder to a company in a financial crisis (i.e., if the company is illiquid, over-indebted or
meets the requirements for a business reorganization procedure) is deemed to be equity replacing. Equity
replacing shareholder loans may not be repaid as long as the crisis subsists and any security interest granted
in connection with such loans may not be enforced. This means, in particular, that in the event of insolvency
of the subsidiary, the respective claims of the shareholder lender are subordinated and rights of segregation
of assets (Aussonderungsrecht) or preferential satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) out of the subsidiary's
assets securing such claims of the shareholder lender expire upon the opening of insolvency proceedings
of the subsidiary. A shareholder is defined as, inter alia, (i) a shareholder with a controlling participation,
(ii) a shareholder with a participation of at least 25%, and (iii) any person who does not hold a participation
in the borrower but has a controlling influence (beherrschenden Einfluss) over the borrower. Furthermore,
_inter alia, a person granting a loan/credit to a company is to be considered a shareholder, inter alia, if (i) it_
holds a participation or other rights in a person other than the borrowing company which allows it to
exercise a controlling influence (beherrschenden Einfluss) over the borrowing company (indirect
controlling participation), or (ii) it indirectly holds a participation in the borrowing company of at least
33%, or (iii) it holds a controlling direct or indirect participation in a company which holds a participation
of at least 25% in the borrowing company.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantee_**

_Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules_

The granting and enforcement of upstream and cross stream guarantees by the Austrian Guarantor is subject
to and may be limited by strict Austrian capital maintenance rules on the preservation of corporate assets
(Kapitalerhaltungsvorschriften) pursuant to Austrian corporate law, in particular sections 82 et seq. of the
Austrian Act on Limited Liability Companies (Gesetz über Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung,
_GmbHG) or sections 52 and 65 et seq. of the Austrian Act on Joint Stock Companies (Aktiengesetz, AktG)_
respectively. These rules protect the assets of the Austrian Guarantor for the benefit of its creditors. The
entire set of corporate assets, even those exceeding the registered share capital, is protected by the Austrian
capital maintenance rules. Austrian capital maintenance rules prohibit corporations or limited partnerships
of which the general partner/s is or are corporations, from disbursing its assets to its shareholders or to
another group company (not being a direct or indirect 100% subsidiary) in circumstances other than as a
distribution of profits (if, to the extent and as long as available for distribution under Austrian law), by a
reduction of share capital or as liquidation surplus on liquidation of that corporations. Guarantees granted
by an Austrian corporation or limited partnership (the unlimited liability partner of which is a corporation)
in order to guarantee liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements
and are thus invalid and unenforceable if the granting of such guarantees by the Austrian entity is not in its
best interest and not fully justified by a business purpose (i.e., not to its corporate benefit (betrieblich
_gerechtfertigt)). Austrian corporate law does not recognize group interest and thus any corporate benefit_
(betriebliche Rechtfertigung) must be tested at the level of the individual Austrian subsidiary; a benefit
solely for the Group (but not for the individual Austrian subsidiary) would not be sufficient.

Any transaction that violates Austrian capital maintenance rules is a prohibited repayment of equity
(verbotene Einlagenrückgewähr) and as such null and void. This nullity may also affect third parties (e.g.,
noteholders) if such third party knew or should have known (gross negligence) that the respective
transaction was not permitted pursuant to Austrian capital maintenance rules.

Therefore, in order to enable Austrian subsidiaries to provide a guarantee with respect to liabilities of a
direct or indirect parent or sister company and in order to reduce the risk of violating the Austrian capital
maintenance rules and the resulting invalidity and unenforceability, it is standard market practice for
indentures, credit agreements and guarantees to contain so-called "limitation language" with respect to
subsidiaries incorporated or established in Austria. Pursuant to such limitation language, the upstream and
sidestream provision of guarantees by Austrian subsidiaries is limited to the extent necessary to avoid a


-----

breach of the Austrian capital maintenance rules. Accordingly, the Note Guarantee granted by the Austrian
Guarantor will be subject to standard limitation language included in the Indenture (or a supplemental
indenture) stating, _inter alia, that all obligations and/or liabilities thereunder shall be limited to the_
maximum amount permitted under the Austrian capital maintenance rules (which amount may be zero or
close to zero).

No case law is available to confirm and it is thus not certain whether the limitations set forth in the Indenture
(or a supplemental indenture), in particular regarding the limitation of the amount guaranteed to an amount
permitted under the Austrian capital maintenance rules, would be valid and enforceable under Austrian law
and achieve the desired effect of legally preserving the Note Guarantee to the extent permitted under the
under Austrian capital maintenance rules or whether the Note Guarantee would be deemed void in its
entirety. Moreover, Austrian capital maintenance rules are subject to ongoing court decisions, and it cannot
be ruled out that future court rulings may further limit the access of creditors and/or shareholders to assets
of subsidiaries incorporated in Austria and constituted in the form of a corporation or of a limited
partnership the general partner or general partners of which is or are corporations.

_Hardening Periods and Clawback_

Under the voidance rules of the Austrian Insolvency Act, an insolvency administrator may, by action of
voidance or by defense of voidance, under certain circumstances, challenge any transaction (which term
for the purposes of this section "Hardening Periods and Clawback" includes, without limitation, the
granting of security and the guaranteeing, assuming and/or paying of debt). In particular, the following
transactions are voidable with respect to the insolvent entity's creditors:

- Voidance due to intent of discrimination (Anfechtung wegen Benachteiligungsabsicht): All
transactions performed or entered into by the debtor within ten years prior to the commencement
of insolvency proceedings with the intent known to the other party to discriminate against its
creditors as well as all transactions entered into by the debtor with the intent to discriminate against
its creditors and which it performed or entered into during the last two years prior to
commencement of insolvency proceedings, provided that the beneficiary of the transaction should
have been aware of such intent of the debtor. If the legal act was concluded with or for the benefit
of certain connected persons (as defined by law) the burden of proof regarding the knowledge of
the intention to discriminate is shifted to that connected person (i.e., the connected person must
prove that they had no knowledge and was not negligent in having no knowledge, respectively).
Should the debtor be a legal entity capable of being a party in a lawsuit, then members of the
managing and supervisory bodies of the debtor as well as the debtor's shareholders with unlimited
liability and the debtor's controlling shareholder or "shareholders" within the definitions of the
Austrian Act on Equity Replacements (Eigenkapitalersatzgesetz) (i.e., in particular shareholders
controlling the debtor or holding a stake of at least 25% or other persons who are not shareholders
but exercise a controlling influence comparable to a majority shareholder) are deemed to be
connected.

- Voidance due to squandering of assets (Anfechtung wegen Vermögensverschleuderung): Delivery,
purchase and barter transactions undertaken by the debtor in the last year prior to the
commencement of insolvency proceedings are voidable, if the other party perceived or should have
perceived such creditor discriminating squandering of assets by the debtor through transactions
below market value.

- Voidance of transactions with no consideration and analogous transactions (Anfechtung
_unentgeltlicher oder ihnen gleichgestellter Verfügungen): In particular, transactions of the debtor_
without consideration (except customary occasional gifts and transactions for a reasonable and
proportionate amount towards a charitable cause or for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, a moral
duty or consideration of decency) and acquisitions of property from the debtor by order of authority
if paid out of the debtor's funds are voidable, if performed or entered into in the last two years prior
to the commencement of insolvency proceedings.

- Voidance due to preferential treatment (Anfechtung wegen Begünstigung): Security or payment
(Befriedigung oder Sicherstellung) given to a creditor (i) after the occurrence of the debtor's
illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or (ii) after filing for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or (iii) in the last 60 days before each of (i) or (ii) is
voidable, if (i) the creditor obtained a security or payment it was not entitled to or not entitled to


-----

in this particular manner or at that particular time (in this case no further subjective elements are
required on the part of the creditor receiving the security or payment), (ii) the security or payment
was given to persons who were aware or should have been aware of the intent of the debtor to treat
them preferential ahead of the debtor's other creditors, or (iii) the transaction was effected for the
benefit of a connected person, unless such connected person (as defined by law, see above) did not
know and should not have known about the debtor's intention to give preferential treatment. A
grant of security or payment under such circumstances is not voidable if the preferential treatment
was given more than one year prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. The burden
of proof is reversed if a security or payment is provided to a connected person.

- Voidance due to knowledge of the debtor's insolvency (Anfechtung wegen Kenntnis der
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit): Any transaction performed or entered into after the occurrence of the_
debtor's illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or over-indebtedness (Überschuldung), each within the
meaning of the Austrian Insolvency Act, or after the filing of a petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings may be challenged if:

    - such transaction constitutes payment or granting of security (Befriedigung oder
_Sicherstellung) to a connected person (as defined by law, see above), or any other_
transaction entered into by the debtor with such connected person which is considered to
be prejudicial to the debtor's creditors (nachteilige Rechtsgeschäfte), unless (i) with
respect to such payment or granting of security, or to a transaction directly prejudicial to
the debtor's creditors, such connected person did not have nor should have had knowledge
of the debtor's inability to pay debts, over-indebtedness or the filing of a petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings and (ii) with respect to a transaction indirectly
prejudicial to the debtor's creditors, the negative effect of such transaction on the
insolvency estate was not objectively foreseeable at the time of entering into the
transaction;

    - such transaction constitutes payment or granting of security (Befriedigung oder
_Sicherstellung) to a creditor, or any other transaction entered into by the debtor with a_
third party which is directly prejudicial (unmittelbar nachteilig) to the debtor's creditors,
provided that the debtor's counterparty knew or should have known of the debtor's
inability to pay debts, over-indebtedness or the filing of a petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings; and

    - entered into by the debtor with a third party which is indirectly prejudicial (mittelbar
_nachteilig) to the debtor's creditors, provided that (i) the debtor's counterparty knew or_
should have known of the debtor's inability to pay debts, over-indebtedness or the filing
of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and (ii) such transaction's negative
effect on the insolvency estate was objectively foreseeable at the time of entering into the
transaction. Such transaction's negative effect is foreseeable, in particular, when a
recovery effort is obviously unsuitable (offensichtlich untaugliches Sanierungskonzept).

A transaction is considered to be indirectly prejudicial (mittelbar nachteilig) if, even though it may
be objectively balanced (i.e., not directly prejudicial to the debtor's creditors), it nonetheless has a
negative effect on the recovery rate of unsecured creditors. Transactions carried out more than six
months prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings may not be voided due to knowledge of the
debtor's insolvency (Anfechtung wegen Kenntnis der Zahlungsunfähigkeit).

The relevant hardening/suspect periods will be extended by the term of a reorganization proceeding if such
reorganization proceeding terminates within the relevant hardening/suspect periods. See "Business
_Reorganization Proceedings."_

In addition to an insolvency administrator voiding transactions according to the Austrian Insolvency Act, a
creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any
transactions pursuant to the provisions of the Austrian Enforcement Code (Exekutionsordnung) outside of
formal insolvency proceedings. The conditions for such action vary to a certain extent from the rules
described above, and the voidance periods commence from the date on which such other creditor exercises
its voidance rights in court.


-----

**_Stamp Duty_**

Under the Austrian Stamp Duty Act (Gebührengesetz), ad valorem stamp duty is triggered upon the creation
of a document (Urkunde; a term which has a technical meaning within the context of the Austrian Stamp
Duty Act) on certain stampdutiable transactions enumerated in the Austrian Stamp Duty Act. Stampdutiable
transactions include, for example, sureties, assignments, lease agreements and mortgages.

Under the Austrian Stamp Duty Act, stamp duty on, for example,

- sureties (Bürgschaften) as well as assumptions of liabilities as joint debtor (Schuldbeitritt) amounts
to 1% of the secured amount (depending on the wording of a guarantee, a guarantee may be treated
as a surety for stamp duty purposes); and

- assignments or transfers of receivables or other rights amounts to 0.8% of the consideration for the
assignment or transfer, or, in a case of an assignment for security (Sicherungszession), to 0.8% of
the lower of either the secured amount or the value of the assigned receivables.

Stampdutiable transactions for security (in particular sureties, assignments, mortgages) may be exempt
from stamp duty if such transaction (exclusively and directly) secures the credit-claims (including interest
and possibly typical ancillary charges) of a lender or creditor against a borrower under a loan or credit
agreement (which, for the purposes of the Austrian Stamp Duty Act, includes such claims against an issuer
under a bond issue). In light of this and to reduce the risk of triggering stamp duty with respect to the
Austrian Guarantor's Note Guarantee, the Austrian Guarantor's Note Guarantee and certain other
indemnities and assumptions of liabilities by the Austrian Guarantor will be limited to
guaranteeing/securing claims that are considered such credit-claims. Note that this exemption will not
apply, inter alia, with respect to other security (including the Note Guarantees, indemnities and assumptions
of liability of the other Guarantors) for the Notes or the Debt Documents, which will not be limited to such
credit-claims.

As a general rule, Austrian stamp duty is triggered if a document on a stampdutiable transaction is created
in Austria and such transaction is not exempt from stamp duty.

Under certain circumstances, also the creation of a document on a stampdutiable transaction outside of
Austria may trigger stamp duty. Stamp duty may thus be triggered for a document created outside of Austria
if (i) the parties to the transaction are resident for stamp duty purposes in Austria (Austrian residence, place
of habitual abode, seat, place of effective management or permanent establishment) and (ii) the transaction
concerns an Austrian situated asset or a party to the transaction is entitled or obliged to performance under
the transaction in Austria.

If the creation of a document outside of Austria did not trigger Austrian stamp duty, stamp duty may be
triggered if the document (or a certified copy thereof) is brought into or sent to Austria and (i) the transaction
concerns an Austrian situated asset or a party to the transaction is entitled or obliged to performance under
the transaction in Austria, or (ii) a legally relevant action is taken in Austria based on the transaction or
official use of the document (or a certified copy thereof) is made in Austria.

Austrian stamp duty may also be triggered by a document that refers to a stampdutiable transaction in a
qualified manner (so called confirming document; rechtsbezeugende Urkunde). According to the Austrian
Federal Ministry of Finance, a confirming document is constituted if the parties to and the nature of the
transaction referred to may be derived from the document. Such document may (already) trigger Austrian
stamp duty if signed by one of the parties and sent to the other party or its representative (or, in case of a
transaction under which both parties are obliged to performance, a third party to furnish proof of the
underlying transaction). Furthermore, stamp duty may be triggered by a so-called substitute document
(Ersatzurkunde; (e.g., a signed protocol on an orally agreed transaction)) on a stampdutiable transaction or
a document that incorporates by reference a document on a (concluded) stampdutiable transaction.

If Austrian stamp duty is triggered, pursuant to the Austrian Stamp Duty Act generally the parties to the
transaction are jointly and severally liable for Austrian stamp duty triggered. In case of a transaction under
which only one party is obliged to performance (e.g., a surety), the party in whose interest the document
was created is liable for the stamp duty (e.g., the beneficiary of a surety) (section 28(1) of the Austrian
Stamp Duty Act). In any case, the other party (as well as, if the competent tax office is not duly notified of
the stampdutiable transaction, the persons who would be responsible for such notification) would be


-----

secondarily liable for the stamp duty triggered. Agreements between the parties as to who shall bear stamp
duty if triggered are not relevant for the tax authorities but may be honoured by the tax authorities within
their discretion.

If stamp duty was triggered and not duly paid or the competent tax office was not duly notified of a
stampdutiable transaction, the competent tax office may, within its discretion, increase the amount of stamp
duty due by up to 100% depending on whether the taxpayer could have recognized that stamp duty was
triggered, the notification was made with slight or substantial delay, or provisions of the Austrian Stamp
Duty Act have been infringed for the first time or repeatedly.

Because, inter alia, the Debt Documents will contain certain guarantees (including the Note Guarantees)
and possibly certain security assignments and will provide for the accession of the Guarantors as joint and
several obligors under some of the Debt Documents, the Debt Documents will be signed outside of Austria
and will provide for certain precautions regarding the bringing of the documents into Austria and referring
to the documents in correspondence (including emails) in Austria in order to reduce the risk of triggering
Austrian stamp duty. In addition, several of the Debt Documents (including the Intercreditor Agreement
and the Indenture) will include a place of performance provision, specifying that the place of performance
(Erfüllungsort) for all rights and obligations under these Debt Documents shall be outside of Austria.

**Belgium**

**_Insolvency_**

The Notes will be guaranteed by companies that are incorporated under the laws of, and have their statutory
seats (statutaire zetel/iege social) in, Belgium (each a "Belgian Obligor"). In the event of an insolvency of
a Belgian Obligor, main insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Belgium; provided that Belgium is the
territory in which the Belgian Obligor's "centre of main interests" is situated. Such proceedings would then
be governed by Belgian law. Under certain circumstances, Belgian law also allows secondary bankruptcy
proceedings to be opened in Belgium over the assets of companies whose "centre of main interests" is not
situated in Belgium. The effects of those secondary proceedings are restricted to the assets situated in
Belgium.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Belgian insolvency law.

Belgian insolvency laws provide for three primary insolvency procedures: (i) a judicial reorganization
procedure (gerechtelijke reorganisatie/réorganisation judiciaire),(ii) transfer of business under judicial
authority and (iii)a bankruptcy procedure (faillissement/faillite). The three types of insolvency proceedings
are governed by Book XX "Insolvency of enterprises" of the Belgian Code of Economic Law.

Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law distinguishes between "private" and "public"
reorganization proceedings, aimed at reaching either (i) an amicable settlement between the debtor and two
or more of its creditors; or (ii) a collective agreement. Transfer of (part) of the activities is now classified
as a liquidation procedure, and no longer as a procedure aimed at preserving the "continuity" of the business.
The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also depend on the position of the
court and/or third parties. As of June 7, 2023, Belgium has implemented the EU Restructuring Directive
through a newly enacted law (the "New Belgian Restructuring Law"). The New Belgian Restructuring
Law entered into force on September 1, 2023. The new law significantly alters the Belgian restructuring
framework by introducing new reorganization proceedings and amending the conditions for the application
of certain existing procedures. These changes will be further assessed below.

In addition, Belgian law allows for a liquidation in deficit (deficitaire vereffening/liquidation déficitaire).
The latter proceeding will not be further discussed.

**_Judicial Reorganization_**

A debtor (and in limited circumstances, its creditors, interested third parties or the public prosecutor) may
file a petition for judicial reorganization if the continuity of the enterprise is at risk, whether immediately
or in the future. The interpretation of this principle is broad and defined by the courts. The fact that the
conditions for bankruptcy are met (entailing that the debtor has the obligation to file for bankruptcy pursuant
to Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law) does not preclude the debtor from applying for a
judicial reorganization.


-----

The petition for judicial reorganization, to be filed with the clerk office of the relevant Enterprise Court,
must include the contemplated measures and proposals that will be taken or made by the debtor to carry out
the reorganization. Further, the petition must be accompanied by a number of documents, including, but
not limited to, an interim balance sheet and income statement, prepared under the supervision of an auditor,
an external expert accountant or a certified tax accountant. The court may however review and, as the case
may be, grant a petition to open judicial reorganization proceedings where the debtor has been unable to
provide certain required documents.

As from the filing of the petition with the relevant Enterprise Court overseeing the judicial reorganization
and for as long as such court has not issued a judgment on the reorganization petition, the debtor cannot be
declared bankrupt (save in case the debtor files a declaration of bankruptcy itself) or wound up by court
order. In addition, during this period between the filing of the petition and the court's decision, subject to
certain exceptions, none of the debtor's assets may be disposed of by any of its creditors as a result of the
enforcement of any security interests that such creditors may hold with respect to such assets. If the debtor
requested the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings less than twelve months ago and such request
was granted, the filing of the petition does not have a suspensory effect, except if the court decides
otherwise.

Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides that, within a period of 15 days as from the filing
of the petition, the court will hear the debtor and/or his or her legal counsel on the petition for reorganization
and will hear the report from the delegated judge. After such hearing, the court will rule within eight days
on the petition for judicial reorganization. If the conditions for judicial reorganization appear to be met, and
all required documents have been provided, the court will declare the judicial reorganization procedure
open, allowing a temporary moratorium for a maximum period of four months. At the request of the debtor
and pursuant to the report issued by the delegated judge, the moratorium period can thereafter be extended
without the total duration of the moratorium exceeding twelve months, and only in exceptional
circumstances (such as due to the size of the business, the complexity of the case or the impact of the
procedure on employment). The extension of the moratorium must not excessively prejudice the interests
of the parties affected, especially creditors.

The granting of the temporary moratorium operates as a stay on enforcement. No enforcement measures
with respect to pre-existing claims in the moratorium can be continued or initiated against any of the
debtor's assets from the time that the moratorium is granted until the end of the period, with limited
exceptions. Furthermore, during the moratorium, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt or wound up by
court order. During the duration of the moratorium, no attachments can be made with regard to pre-existing
claims. Creditors however retain the possibility to be granted legal or contractual security. Conservatory
attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization retain their conservatory
character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have a material adverse
effect on the situation of the creditor concerned. If the date for the forced sale of moveable or immovable
property has already been set, such sale may, under certain conditions, be continued.

Personal guarantees granted by third parties in favor of the debtor's creditors are not covered by the
enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, nor are the debts payable by co-debtors, subject to
certain exceptions or qualifications in respect of guarantees granted by individuals. The moratorium also
does not prevent the voluntary payment by the debtor of claims covered by the moratorium to the extent
such payment is necessary for the continuity of the enterprise.

During the judicial reorganization procedure, the board of directors and management of the debtor in
principle continue to exercise their management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of the court.
However, upon request of the debtor or any interested party and insofar as the reorganization is intended to
achieve a collective agreement, the court may, if the protection of the interested parties so requires, appoint
a restructuring practitioner (herstructureringsdeskundige / _praticien de la réorganisation) to assist the_
debtor or creditors in the negotiation and drafting of the reorganization plan or to facilitate the conclusion
of an amicable settlement. The court may also appoint a liquidation practitioner (praticien de la liquidation/
_vereffeningsdeskundige), upon the request of the debtor or any interested party or the public prosecutor, in_
the event of significant shortcomings (kennelijk tekortkomingen/manquements caractérisés) of the debtor
or any of its corporate bodies threatening the continuity of the enterprise facing difficulties or its economic
activities and provided such measure can preserve such continuity, to either exercise particular tasks
indicated by the court, or to replace the debtor or any of its corporate bodies for the duration of the
moratorium. In addition, in the event of manifestly gross negligence (kennelijk grove fout/faute grave et
_caractérisée), the court may, upon the request of any interested party or the public prosecutor (by joint_


-----

application), or upon its own initiative (in case of emergency) appoint a temporary administrator (voorlopig
_bewindvoerder/administrateur provisoire) replacing the debtor's corporate bodies for the duration of the_
moratorium and charged with the management of the debtor. Furthermore, upon request of any interested
party or upon its own initiative, the court may decide that the company loses all or part of the management
of all or part of its assets or activities and appoint a restructuring practicioner in case of important, precise
and consistent indications (gewichtige, bepaalde en met elkaar overeenstemmende _aanwijzigingen/indices_
_graves, précis et concordants) that the conditions for bankruptcy are met._

The delegated judge, appointed by the court to assist the debtor in achieving the goal of the reorganization,
has additional powers, including the power to advise the court to end the reorganization procedure
prematurely if he or she considers that the debtor is clearly not in a state to ensure the continuity of the
whole or part of his or her business.

The reorganization procedure aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern.
Consequently, the initiation of the judicial reorganization proceedings does not terminate any contracts.
Contractual provisions that provide for the early termination or acceleration of the contract upon the
initiation or approval of a reorganization procedure, and certain contractual terms such as default interest,
may not be enforceable during such a procedure. Such enforcement prohibition applies, with a few
exceptions, to close-out netting provisions as well if the judicial reorganization procedure affects (i) a
corporate debtor which is not a public or financial legal entity within the meaning of the Belgian Financial
Collateral Act or (ii) a public or financial legal entity but where the creditor itself is not such an entity.
Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract on
the basis of a debtor's default that occurred prior to the reorganization procedure if the debtor remedies such
default within a 15-day period following the notification of such default after the opening of the
proceedings.

As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract
(except employment contracts) during the reorganization procedure; provided that the debtor notifies the
creditor, and the decision is necessary for the debtor to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its
creditors or to transfer all or part of the enterprise or its assets. The exercise of this right does not prevent
the creditor, however, from suspending in turn the performance of its own obligations. However, the
creditor cannot terminate the agreement solely on the ground that the debtor has suspended the performance
of its own obligations.

_(Out of court) Amicable Settlement_

In the past, in the case of an amicable settlement as provided by Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic
Law, the debtor could draw up an agreement and joint payment scheme plan with at least two creditors in
order to settle its debts. The New Belgian Restructuring law innovates allowing that an amicable settlement
can be concluded with one creditor instead of at least two. The debtor may petition the court to grant a grace
period in respect of its payment obligations (e.g., in relation to interest payments), pending the negotiation
of the agreement. Only the parties to the amicable settlement will be bound by the terms they have agreed.
If an agreement is reached for reorganization purposes, it is submitted to the court and entered into a
register. Any party may ask the court to confirm the out of court amicable settlement in order to obtain an
enforceable title (and not only the debtor alone). In addition, the court will carry out a review of the amicable
settlement. This (marginal) control consists in verifying that the provisions of the agreement comply with
the formalities established by law and that the settlement does not violate public order. The court's approval
concludes the procedure. Such an amicable settlement will remain enforceable in the event of a later
bankruptcy, subject to certain exceptions. The court can impose a binding payment plan on creditors with
whom an amicable settlement could not be concluded.

_Collective Agreement_

In the case of a judicial reorganization by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a restructuring plan
during the reorganization procedure.

One of the key features of the New Belgian Restructuring Law is the creation of a twofold regime for public
judicial reorganization by collective agreement: one for large companies, and one for small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs).

_SMEs_


-----

For SMEs, the current proceedings will largely continue to apply. An SME is defined as a company which,
alone or on a consolidated basis with their controlled entities, does not exceed two of any of the below
thresholds during two consecutive financial years: (i) it employs maximally 250 employees; (ii) it has a net
turnover of €40 million; or (iii) it has a total balance sheet of €20 million.

The debtor must prepare a reorganization plan in which it includes a list of its creditors and the amount of
their claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the debtor, as well as details regarding security
interests, if applicable. Creditors with pre-existing claims, as well as any other interested party that claims
to be a creditor, can challenge the amounts and the ranking of the secured claims declared by the debtor.
The court can determine the disputed amounts and the ranking of such claims on a preliminary basis for the
purpose of the reorganization procedure or definitively, on the condition that it has jurisdiction in that
respect but that the decision relating to the dispute cannot be taken in a sufficiently short time frame. In
addition, the court can, at any time, in the event of absolute necessity and upon the request of the debtor or
the creditor, change the amount and the ranking of the claim initially declared by the debtor on the basis of
new elements at the latest 15 days before the date on which the creditors will vote on the reorganization
plan. If a creditor has not challenged the amount and the ranking of its claim at least one month in advance
of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the reorganization plan, the amount of its
claim will remain unchanged for voting purposes as well as for the purposes of the reorganization plan.

The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a reorganization plan, with the
assistance of the court-appointed administrator or enterprise mediator, as the case may be. The plan may
include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the
conversion of debt into equity (Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law contains certain limitations,
primarily in view of protecting employees of the debtor) and may be based on a differentiated treatment of
various categories of creditors. The maximum duration of the plan is five years. The reorganization plan
must be filed with the electronic registry managed by the Belgian bar associations (www.regsol.be) at least
20 days in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote its approval. The court needs to ratify the
reorganization plan prior to its taking effect. A reorganization plan approved by a double majority of the
creditors (both in headcount and in principal amount due) and ratified by the court will bind the debtor and
all creditors, including those who voted against it or did not vote and whether secured or not. The
reorganization plan can bind creditors who have a contractual lien over specific assets, pledgees,
mortgagees, and the so-called creditor-owners; provided that (i) interest is paid on the principal amount of
their outstanding debts and (ii) their rights are not suspended for more than 24 months as of the ratification
of the collective agreement by the court. Subject to certain conditions, this period of 24 months may be
extended by another twelve months. No other measures can be imposed on such creditors without their
individual agreement. The court may refuse ratification if the conditions of the judicial reorganization
proceeding were not met or if the proposed reorganization plan violates public policy. SME's may however
choose to opt-in for the large companies' regime (see next section). The choice to opt in for the new regime
is solely at the discretion of the debtor.

_Large companies_

The New Belgian Restructuring Law provides for a new reorganization regime for collective agreements
for large companies (i.e., companies which, for a period of two consecutive years, have either (i) 250 or
more employees, (ii) an annual turnover exceeding €40 million, or (iii) a balance sheet total exceeding
€20 million), which was already introduced by an amendment to Book XX of the Belgian Code of
Economic Law dated March 26, 2021.

In the more complex reorganization regime for large companies, creditors are divided into separate classes
based on their respective rights in a liquidation scenario and/or the rights conferred on them in the proposed
reorganization plan. Equity holders form a separate class. The plan is approved if a majority of each class
(in value of the claims in principal and interest) approves it. There is a double test to "cramdown" dissenting
(classes of) creditors. First, the "best-interest-of-creditors test" applies, meaning that no dissenting creditor
can be manifestly worse off under the reorganization plan than in a liquidation scenario. Second, a "crossclass cramdown" to impose the plan on non-consenting classes is only possible if additional criteria are
met, more particularly: (i) if there are two classes, one of the two classes must approve the plan; (ii) if there
are more than two classes, a majority of the classes of parties affected by the plan must approve it (including
at least the class of secured creditors or a class ranking ahead of the class of ordinary creditors, or if that is
not the case, at least one class of creditors who could reasonably be expected to receive payment if the
normal order of priority in liquidation were to be applied); and (iii) the plan cannot derogate to the detriment
of any of the dissenting categories from the existing legal or contractual priority that would apply in the


-----

context of a liquidation, unless there would be a reasonable basis for such a derogation and the relevant
creditors or equity holders are not manifestly disadvantaged as a result of such derogation. The creation of
classes and new voting mechanics imply that valuation discussions will become increasingly important in
the context of reorganization proceedings. Distressed debtors and their creditors may hence need to involve
financial advisors at an early stage to avoid challenges and/or protect their interests.

_Private Insolvency Procedure_

The New Belgian Restructuring Law introduced a "private" (or confidential) insolvency procedure,
allowing the debtor to confidentially test the possibility of a court assisted amicable arrangement or a
collective agreement with creditors, outside the scope of formal judicial reorganization proceedings. During
the negotiation phase, only a limited moratorium may be put in place which may not exceed four months
and by means of which the court may subject unwilling or malicious creditors to payment terms and
enforcement measures for certain creditors may be suspended. Unlike the "regular" public judicial
reorganization procedure, the private judicial reorganization procedure does not trigger an automatic and
general stay of individual enforcement actions. If the negotiations are successful, the pre-pack proceedings
may be transformed into formal judicial reorganization proceedings to have the amicable arrangement
sanctioned or the collective agreement put to vote on an expedited timetable.

**_Bankruptcy_**

The Belgian bankruptcy procedure is governed by Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law and by
case law.

Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors or upon the initiative of the
public prosecutor's office, or the provisional administrator of the debtor's assets or the liquidator of "main
insolvency proceedings" opened in another EU member state (other than Denmark) in accordance with the
EU Insolvency Regulation.

Conditions for a bankruptcy order (aangifte van faillissement/déclaration de faillite) are that the debtor
must be in a situation of cessation of payments (staking van betaling/cessation de paiements) and be unable
to obtain further credit (wiens krediet geschokt is/ébranlement de crédit). Cessation of payments is
generally considered as the inability of the debtor to pay its debts as they fall due. Such situation must be
persistent and not merely temporary. The mere fact that a debtor's liabilities exceed its assets does not mean
that the bankruptcy conditions are met. Companies in liquidation can be declared bankrupt up to six months
after the judgment closing the liquidation. In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights
concerning the management of the bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver (curator/curateur) becomes
responsible for the operation of the business and implements the sale of the debtor's assets, the distribution
of the sale proceeds to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor (its decisions being, as the case may be,
subject to prior court authorization). The rights of (unsecured) creditors in the process are limited to being
informed of the course of the bankruptcy proceedings on a regular basis by the bankruptcy receiver.
Creditors may oppose the sale of assets by bringing an action before the court, or may request the temporary
continued operation of the business.

The bankruptcy receiver must decide whether or not to continue performance of ongoing contracts (i.e.,
contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The bankruptcy receiver may decide not to continue the
performance of one or several contracts, subject to certain limitations, according to case law. The
counterparty to an ongoing contract may summon the bankruptcy receiver to take a decision within 15 days.
If no extension of the 15-day term is agreed upon or if the bankruptcy receiver does not make any decision,
the ongoing contract is presumed to be terminated after the expiration of the 15-day term. If the bankruptcy
receiver decides not to continue the performance of an ongoing contract or if an ongoing contract is
terminated due to the expiration of the 15-day term, the counterparty to the contract can file a claim for
damages against the bankrupt estate, in which case such claim will rank pari passu with the claims of all
other unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract dissolved. The counterparty
may not seek injunctive relief or require specific performance of the contract.


-----

Subject to prior court authorization, the bankruptcy receiver may elect to continue operating the business
of the debtor; provided that such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. Two exceptions
apply, however:

- the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes
an automatic early termination or acceleration event; and

- _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the counterparty constitutes an_
essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the
bankruptcy judgment, since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company.
Parties can agree to continue to perform under such contracts.

As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the
court order opening bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy receiver
may proceed against the debtor and liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply to a
pledge on financial instruments or cash held on account falling within the scope of the Belgian Financial
Collateral Act. Further exceptions exist with regard to estate debts (boedelschulden/dettes de la masse).

As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on its
unsecured debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, such as tax debts or social security debts.

The ranking of different types of debt of the bankrupt debtor is determined on the basis of a complex set of
rules. The following is a general overview of only the main principles:

- Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the bankruptcy receiver during the bankruptcy
proceedings, the so-called "estate debts," have a senior priority. In addition, if the bankruptcy
receiver has contributed to the realization and enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be
paid to the bankruptcy receiver in priority out of the proceeds of the realized assets before
distributing the remainder to the secured creditors. Tax and social security claims incurred during
the judicial reorganization proceedings will be preferential debts of the estate in a subsequent
liquidation or bankruptcy;

- Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured asset
(whether by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization);

- Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (e.g., tax claims, claims
for social security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank ahead of privileges on all
assets of the debtor. Certain privileges prevail over security interests (e.g., the privilege for costs
made to preserve a certain asset, an unpaid seller's lien etc.);

- Unsecured creditors (pari passu): Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of security
interests and privileges have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be distributed
by the bankruptcy receiver among the unsecured creditors who rank pari passu (unless a creditor
agreed to be subordinated); and

- Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any).

Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides that any assets, amounts and sums of distributions
(such as income generated by a new activity) received after a bankruptcy are excluded from the bankruptcy
estate if their relevant cause dates from after the bankruptcy.

_Pre-Packaged Bankruptcy Procedure_

The New Belgian Restructuring Law also introduced a new regime of private preparation for bankruptcy
proceedings. The "private" (or confidential) bankruptcy preparation procedure can only be initiated by the
debtor. In its petition, the debtor must demonstrate that the confidential pre-bankruptcy proceedings will (i)
facilitate the liquidation of the company while achieving the highest possible distribution to the joint
creditors, and (ii) preserve jobs to the extent possible. If the court grants the debtor's request, a liquidation
practitioner ("vereffeningsdeskundige"/"praticien de la liquidation") is appointed for a maximum of 30 days
(with possible extension to a total of 60 days). The liquidation practitioner will monitor the procedure
representing the interests of the creditors, who will generally be appointed as the liquidator in the ensuing


-----

bankruptcy procedure. Following the confidential preparation procedure, formal bankruptcy proceedings
are opened during which in general the appointed liquidation expert will act as bankruptcy trustee to finalize
the negotiated transfer, if any. The legislator aims to avoid the situation of the traditional bankruptcy, which
is immediately declared and published (with all the negative consequences of such publicity) and also limit
some abuse of self-assignment. According to the most recent case law of the European Court of Justice, the
transferee will not be obliged to take over all employees if the agreement is reached in the framework of
such pre-pack agreements.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The grant of a guarantee or collateral by the Belgian Guarantor for the obligations of another group
company must fall within the grantor's legal and corporate object and must serve the own corporate benefit
of the Belgian Guarantor and comply with any applicable financial assistance rules. Corporate benefit is
not a well-defined concept under Belgian law and its interpretation is left to the courts and legal authors.
The corporate benefit rules and their application in the context of granting guarantees or collateral for the
benefit of a group company are not clearly established under Belgian law and there is only limited case law
on this issue.

The question of corporate benefit must be determined on a case-by-case basis by reference to the prevailing
factual circumstances. Consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the relevant
Belgian company would derive from the transaction and is particularly relevant for upstream or crossstream guarantees and collateral.

It is generally argued by legal scholars that such benefit should be proportionally greater than the risk for
the relevant Belgian company resulting from the granting and/or enforcement of the guarantee concerned.
The financial support granted by a Belgian company should not exceed its financial capabilities. Belgian
case law does not offer clear guidelines on when a group transaction is within the individual group member's
corporate benefit and when aforementioned conditions are met.

Whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact to be assessed by the board of
directors of the Belgian Guarantor. The corporate benefit justifications by the Belgian companies' boards
of directors will be subject to only a "marginal review" by the courts; in insolvency situations, however,
the courts can be expected to take a more critical view.

If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the relevant company may be held liable (i)
by the company for negligence in the management of the company and (ii) by third parties in tort. Moreover,
the guarantee or collateral could be declared null and void and, under certain circumstances, the creditor
that benefits from the guarantee or collateral could be held liable for up to the amount of the guarantee.
Alternatively, the guarantee or collateral could be reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate
benefit, or the creditor may be held liable for any guarantee amount in excess of such amount. These rules
have seldom been tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on this matter.

In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee and collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or
indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is
standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain
so-called "limitation language" in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium.
Accordingly, the Indenture will contain such limitation language and the Guarantee of the Belgian
Guarantor will be so limited. Including such limitation language is, however, not conclusive in determining
or upholding the corporate benefit.

**_Beneficial Ownership_**

As there is no concept of "beneficial ownership" or "beneficial owner" under the present Belgian legal
system, the rights, claims and effects resulting from such a concept may not be enforceable under Belgian
law.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event of bankruptcy proceedings governed by Belgian law, certain business transactions that have
been concluded or performed by the debtor during the "hardening period" may be declared ineffective
against third parties.


-----

In principle, the cessation of payments (which constitutes a condition for filing for bankruptcy) is deemed
to have occurred as of the date of the bankruptcy order. The court issuing the bankruptcy order may
determine, based on serious and objective indications that the cessation of payments occurred on an earlier
date. Such earlier date may not be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order, except
in the case where the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was dissolved more than six months before
the date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its creditors, in which
case the date of cessation of payments may be determined to be the date of such decision to dissolve the
company. The period from the date of cessation of payments up to the declaration of bankruptcy is referred
to as the "hardening period" (verdachte periode/période suspecte).

The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which will be declared ineffective
against third parties and which are unenforceable against the bankruptcy receiver include, among others,
(i) gratuitous transactions or transactions where the consideration received is considerably below the value
of the act or asset provided by the debtor, (ii) payments for debts which are not due, (iii) payments other
than in cash for debts due, and (iv) new security provided for pre-existing debt. However, transactions
entered into as part of an amicable settlement as provided by Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic
Law (whether in the context of formal reorganization proceedings or not) are not subject to limbs (ii) to (iv)
above.

Other transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period may be declared ineffective
against third parties, provided that the counterparty was aware of the debtor's cessation of payment (and
unless such transactions were entered into as part of an amicable settlement as provided by Book XX of the
Belgian Code of Economic Law, whether in the context of formal reorganization proceedings or not).

In particular, a guarantee or security interest entered into during the hardening period may be declared
ineffective against third parties if (i) it is regarded as having been granted gratuitously or where the
consideration received is considerably below the value of the guarantee or security interests provided, (ii)
the beneficiaries of the guarantee or security interests were aware of the company's cessation of payments
or (iii) (as regards security interests) it is granted for pre-existing debts.

If the Guarantee granted by the Belgian Guarantor is successfully voided (based on the considerations
above), holders of the Notes would cease to have any claim in respect of such Guarantee and would be
under an obligation to repay any amounts received pursuant to such Guarantee.

Finally, regardless of any declaration by the Business Court of a hardening period, a third-party creditor
may obtain a court ruling that any act or transaction (such as a guarantee) is not enforceable against it if it
can establish that the challenged act or transaction was entered into with the fraudulent intent to adversely
affect its position as an existing creditor (actio pauliana/action paulienne), irrespective of its date.

**_Grace Periods_**

In addition, enforcement rights may, like those of any other creditor, be subject to Article 1244 of the
Belgian Civil Code or other similar legal provisions. Pursuant to these provisions, Belgian courts may, in
any civil proceeding involving a debtor, defer or otherwise reasonably reschedule the payment dates of
payment obligations. Belgian courts can also decide that the interest rate applicable be reduced if it is
considered to exceed the normal rate applicable to similar debts.

**_Recognition and Enforcement_**

The granting of a guarantee may be subject to validity and/or enforceability conditions. The breach of any
of such conditions may render such guarantee invalid or unenforceable. The foreclosure of a guarantee may
be subject to formalities (e.g., judicial or non-judicial consent) and may be time consuming in the event
that the foreclosure takes place under judicial control or in the event of a legal dispute. Courts may condition
the enforcement of a guarantee upon the evidence that the creditor has a final and undisputed claim
triggering the foreclosure of the guarantee. Enforcement of guarantees may be hindered by conflict of law
and/or conflict of jurisdiction issues and may not breach any public policy provision and/or mandatory legal
provisions. Courts may require a sworn translation in French or Dutch of the English documents which they
may review.

**France**

**_Insolvency_**

Certain of the Guarantors have their registered office in France (the "French Guarantors"). Their "centre
of main interest" is presumed to be located in France (see "—European Union") and therefore any main
insolvency proceedings (within the meaning of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation) of the Issuer or the
French Guarantors would be opened in France unless this presumption is rebutted. In cases where the EU
Insolvency Regulation does not apply, French insolvency proceedings may also be opened under certain
circumstances with respect to companies that are not incorporated in France if they hold an interest in
France, whether it be their "main center of interests" or a mere establishment.

French court-administered insolvency proceedings are either safeguard (sauvegarde), accelerated safeguard
(sauvegarde accélérée), reorganization or liquidation proceedings (redressement or liquidation judiciaire).
Confidential court-assisted proceedings also exist to help debtors restructure their indebtedness in a
consensual manner (namely mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings).

Specialized courts exist for conciliation or insolvency proceedings with respect to (i) debtors that exceed
(directly or through the companies under their control) (y) €20 million in turnover and 250 employees or
(z) €40 million in turnover, (ii) commencement of proceedings pursuant to the Recast EU Insolvency
Regulation or (iii) in cases where the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply regarding a debtor
which is not incorporated in France, commencement of proceedings with respect to which the court's
jurisdiction results from the debtor having its main center of interests therein.

In addition, the French court that commences insolvency proceedings with respect to a member of a
corporate group has jurisdiction over the companies that the member company controls or is controlled by,
within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, subject to French courts
having international jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined above).
Accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the whole group and may, for this
purpose, appoint the same judicial administrator and creditors' representative (mandataire judiciaire) for
all proceedings in respect of members of the group.

In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of
employment over the payment of creditors and could limit the ability of the holders of the Notes to enforce
their rights under the Notes and/or the guarantees granted by the French Guarantors and corresponding
security interests.

The following is a general discussion of preventive and insolvency proceedings governed by French law
for informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be
relevant to holders of the Notes.

**_Grace Periods_**

In addition to and independently from the specific provisions of insolvency laws discussed below, the
holders of the Notes could also be subject to Articles 1343-5 et seq. of the French Civil Code (Code civil).

Pursuant to the provisions of this Article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings
involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor's
financial position and the creditor's needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two
years the payment dates of due payment obligations and decide that any amounts, the payment date of
which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but
not lower than the prevailing legal rate as published twice a year by administrative decree of the Ministry
of Economy) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of principal. A court order made
under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code will suspend pending enforcement measures (mesures
_d'exécution forcée) – but not preservation measures (mesures conservatoires) – and any contractual default_
interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the grace periods ordered by the relevant
court. A creditor cannot contract out of such grace periods. If the debtor is engaged in conciliation
proceedings or has reached a conciliation agreement that is in the course of being executed, special rules
apply to the grant of grace periods (see "Conciliation Proceedings" below).


-----

**_Insolvency (Cessation des Paiements) under French Law_**

Under French law, a company is insolvent (in a state of cessation des paiements) when it is not able to pay
its debts which are due and payable with its available assets taking into account available credit lines and
moratoria.

The court order may set the date of insolvency up to 18 months before the date of the court order
commencing judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings. Except for fraud, the date of insolvency
may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement
(homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning of
the hardening period (période suspecte) (see below).

**_Court-Assisted Pre-Insolvency Proceedings_**

Pre-insolvency proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor company itself, in its sole discretion;
provided that it experiences or anticipates legal, economic or financial difficulties:

(i) while not being in a state of cessation des paiements in case of mandat ad hoc or conciliation
proceedings, or

(ii) while not being in a state of _cessation des paiements_ for more than 45 days in case of
_conciliation proceedings only._

_Mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings are informal and confidential (subject to the below as regards_
_conciliation proceedings) proceedings carried out under the supervision of the president of the court. The_
president of the competent court will appoint an officer (as the case may be, a mandataire ad hoc or a
conciliator) in order to help the debtor company reach an agreement with its main creditors and stakeholders,
in particular by reducing or rescheduling its indebtedness. Such proceedings are non-binding since the
court-appointed intermediary has no power to force the parties to accept an agreement and the dissenting
creditors will not be bound by the arrangement, if any. Except under specific circumstances, and subject to
grace periods provisions that remain applicable, creditors are not barred from taking legal action against
the company to recover their claims.

Contractual provisions modifying the conditions for the performance of an ongoing contract, by
diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely by reason of the appointment of a
_mandataire ad hoc or the opening of conciliation proceedings or any request made to this end are deemed_
null and void. Equally, contractual provisions that would, as the sole result of the appointment of a
_mandataire_ _ad hoc or the opening of conciliation proceedings, make the debtor bear the fees of the creditor's_
counsel relating to such proceedings for the portion that would exceed three quarters of the total fee of the
relevant counsel are null and void.

Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being
reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any
specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement
of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before three months have
elapsed as from the end of the previous ones.

**_Mandat Ad Hoc Proceedings_**

In practice, mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing difficulties of an economic or
financial nature but are not insolvent ("en état de cessation des paiements"), even though statutory law does
not explicitly preclude insolvent debtors from applying for mandat ad hoc proceedings. There is no time
limit for the duration of mandat ad hoc proceedings. The agreement reached by the parties (if any) with the
help of the court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc, whose name can be suggested by the debtor and
whose duties are determined by the court appointing him, usually to facilitate negotiations with the creditors)
can be reported to the president of the court but, unlike in conciliation proceedings, French law does not
provide for any approval by the court or recognition by the president of the court with the related specific
consequences. This restructuring agreement between the company and its main creditors will be negotiated
on a purely consensual and voluntary basis; those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the
arrangement. The _mandataire ad hoc_ is appointed in order to facilitate negotiations with creditors but


-----

cannot coerce the latter into accepting any proposal. Such proceedings are confidential (save for their
disclosure for statutory auditors, if any).

In any event, the debtor retains the right to bring a claim before the court in view of obtaining a grace period
as set forth in Articles 1343-5 et seq. of the French Civil Code.

**_Conciliation Proceedings_**

Conciliation proceedings are available to debtors that face current or foreseeable difficulties of a legal,
economic or financial nature but which have not been insolvent (in a state of cessation des paiements) for
more than 45 days. The debtor petitions the president of the relevant court for the appointment of a
"conciliator" (whose name the debtor can suggest) in charge of assisting the debtor in negotiating with all
or part of its creditors and/or trade partners an agreement, that puts an end to its difficulties, providing, for
example, for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Conciliation proceedings may last up to four months
(with the conciliator being able to request an extension up to five months). Such proceedings are
confidential (save for their disclosure for statutory auditors, if any).

While no general stay is imposed on creditors, which may therefore continue to sue the debtor for payment
of their claims, the following measures may affect creditors' rights during conciliation proceedings:

(i) if the debtor receives a formal notice from a creditor requesting payment or faces enforcement
measures, or if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by
the conciliator to defer payment of its claim, the debtor may bring a claim before the judge that
commenced conciliation proceedings in view of obtaining, after the conciliator has been heard, a
grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see "Grace Periods"
above);

(ii) if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator
to defer payment of its claim that are not yet due for the duration of the conciliation proceedings,
the judge that commenced conciliation proceedings may, after having heard the conciliator, defer
or reschedule that creditor's claim for the duration of the conciliation proceedings; and

(iii) creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (redressement judiciaire or
_liquidation judiciaire) against the debtor._

The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president
of the court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them and enforceable
without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential.

Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the court at the request of the
debtor following a hearing held for that purpose which will have to be attended by the works council, as
the case may be, if (i) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an
end to the debtor's insolvency, (ii) the conciliation agreement effectively ensures that the company will
survive as a going concern and (iii) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the nonsignatory creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgement (constat) as described
above, except that in addition:

      - the decision of approval by the relevant court will be public but the agreement itself should
otherwise remain confidential (subject to certain exceptions);

      - creditors who, as part of the approved agreement or during the course of the conciliation
proceedings, provide new money or goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of
the business of the distressed company (other than shareholders providing new equity) will
benefit from a specific protection (the so-called "New Money Lien") and as such enjoy
priority of payment over all pre-petition and post-petition claims (other than certain prepetition employment claims and post-petition procedural costs), in the event of subsequent
court-administered proceedings;


-----

      - in the event of subsequent court-administered proceedings, the payment date of claims
benefiting from the New Money Lien may not be rescheduled and these claims may not be
written-off without their holders' consent; and

      - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation
proceedings, the date of the cessation des paiements (and therefore the starting date of the
"hardening period" as defined below) cannot be determined by the court to be at a date earlier
than the date of the approval of the agreement by the court, except in case of fraud.

Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the debtor,
appoint the conciliator to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l'exécution de
_l'accord) during its execution._

While the agreement is in force:

      - any legal action and suit for payment in respect of claims which were dealt with in the
conciliation agreement is prohibited;

      - the court may impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate in the
conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have
formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt
with in the conciliation agreement; and

      - interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be
compounded.

If the debtor breaches the agreement, whether approved or acknowledged, any party thereto can petition
the court for its rescission. The rescission of the agreement will not apply to the clauses of the agreement
organizing the consequences of such rescission and such clauses shall continue to apply. The
commencement of subsequent court-administered proceedings will automatically put an end to the
conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by the payments
already received) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees.

**_Court-Administered Proceedings_**

The following French proceedings may be initiated in France by or against a company:

      - safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde), accelerated safeguard proceedings
(procédure de sauvegarde accélérée), upon petition by the debtor only if, while not being in
a state of cessation des paiements (or for accelerated safeguard proceedings, if in cessation
_des paiements for less than 45 days when it initially requested the opening of conciliation_
proceedings), it is facing difficulties which it cannot overcome. Absent any difficulties it
cannot overcome, the court will invite the debtor to file for conciliation proceedings. The
conditions for the opening of accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde
_accélérée) are described below._

      - judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation
proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) upon petition by the debtor, any creditor or the public
prosecutor if the debtor is in cessation des paiements. Judicial reorganization proceedings are
available to companies whose recovery prospects are possible while judicial liquidation
proceedings are available to companies whose recovery is manifestly impossible.

While a company may file for safeguard proceedings at any time it is facing insurmountable difficulties, it
is required to petition for the opening of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings within
45 days of becoming in a state of cessation des paiements. Alternatively, the debtor may request the opening
of conciliation proceedings within the same timeframe. If it does not, de jure managers and, as the case
may be, de facto managers of the company, may be subject to civil liability.

A lien (the "Post-Commencement Lien") applies to certain claims arising after the commencement of the
proceedings that are incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in


-----

consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor. The Post Commencement Lien may also
apply to new cash contributions made in order to ensure the continuity of the debtor's business during such
proceedings, with the exception of those made through a share capital increase, by any person (i) during
the observation period in safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings or the temporary continuation of
business operations in judicial liquidation proceedings, in which case such cash contributions must be
authorized by the insolvency judge, or (ii) for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan,
including when such plan is being amended, it being specified that the judgment endorsing or modifying
the plan must mention all new cash contributions benefiting from the Post Commencement Lien, as well as
the relevant amounts.

Claims benefiting from the Post Commencement Lien enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement
claims in the event of on-going or subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings
or judicial liquidation proceedings, except with respect to claims secured by a retention right, employees'
super-privilege claims, procedural costs and the New Money Lien, pre-petition claims secured by real estate
security (in judicial liquidation proceedings only) and post-petition wages claims not advanced by the
French wages guarantee fund. The aforementioned cash-contribution claims and certain post-petition wages
claims benefitting from the Post Commencement Lien cannot be the subject of any rescheduling or waiver
without the consent of their holders.

**_Court-Administered Proceedings—Safeguard_**

A debtor which experiences difficulties that is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent
(see "Insolvency"). Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing before the
court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following the commencement of
safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is mandatorily
appointed for companies that exceed a certain size (at least (i) €3 million of net turnover and (ii) 20
employees) to investigate the business of the debtor during an "observation period" (being the period
starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the
court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to twelve months. The role
of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet
_de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circulate among its creditors. Creditors do not have effective control_
over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the court-appointed administrator.
The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or
her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the
debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission d'assistance), all under the supervision
of the court.

The court may convert such safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings in certain
circumstances.

Creditors whose rights are affected by the plan must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor's
liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity swaps)
prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the
size of the business.

Standard consultation: this applies to debtors for which the class-based consultation is not mandatory or
requested by the debtor with the consent of the insolvency judge (as described below).

In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed
creditors' representative, who informs each creditor who filed a claim. Creditors are consulted individually
or collectively.

The duration of the plan is determined by the court and may not exceed ten years, or 15 years in relation to
agricultural or maritime fishing businesses.

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the
plan is approved are not required to be consulted.


-----

Creditors who do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than
debt-for-equity-swap proposals) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors' representative
keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator
and any creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as a controller (contrôleur).

Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de
_sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals that_
were submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting from
the New Money Lien or, for certain claims, the Post Commencement Lien) over a maximum period of ten
years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity
dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the
same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor's
individual acceptance.

Following a court-imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment
adopting the plan or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than
the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to
what the creditor would have received had it been paid in accordance with the uniform payment
rescheduling applying to the other creditors. In the third, fourth and fifth year, the amount of each annual
instalment must be of at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim, and at least 10% of the amount of each
debt claim as from the sixth year, except for agricultural businesses.

Class-based consultation: this applies mandatorily in case of accelerated safeguard proceedings (see below)
and, in case of safeguard and judicial reorganization proceedings, to (i) companies that either (x) employ
at least 250 employees and have a net turnover of at least €20 million or (y) have a net turnover of at least
€40 million, and (ii) companies that own or control another company, within the meaning of Articles L.
233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, provided that all the companies together reach the
aforementioned thresholds. This could also apply, in case these thresholds are not met, upon the debtor's
request (in safeguard proceedings) or upon the debtor's or the judicial administrator's request (in judicial
reorganization proceedings), in each case with the consent of the insolvency judge.

Only affected parties (parties affectées) are entitled to vote on the draft restructuring plan. These affected
parties being (i) creditors whose rights are directly affected by the proposed draft restructuring plan and (ii)
equity holders (détenteurs de capital), if their equity interest in the debtor, the articles of association, or
their rights are modified by the proposed restructuring plan.

The constitution of classes of creditors is made under the responsibility of the judicial administrator, who
will, on the basis of objective and verifiable criteria, group within the same class creditors sharing sufficient
common economic interest (communauté d'intérêt économique suffisante). Claims taken into account are
those indicated by the debtor and certified by its auditor(s) or, in the absence of an auditor, in a certificate
from the debtor's certified public accountant.

In determining the composition of each class the judicial administrator shall ensure that (i) creditors
benefiting from "rights in rem" security (sûretés réelles) over the debtor's assets and other creditors are in
separate classes, (ii) the determination of each class complies with the subordination arrangements entered
into before the opening of the relevant proceedings (provided that these subordination arrangements have
been provided to the judicial administrator within 10 days of receipt of the notice sent by the judicial
administrator or the publication of such notice inviting the affected parties to notify the existence of such
arrangements) and (iii) equity holders are grouped in one or several classes. The judicial administrator can
also create "ad hoc" classes, for example for public creditors or strategic suppliers.

At least 21 days prior to the date of the vote on the draft restructuring plan, the judicial administrator shall
notify each affected party of the methods of class allocation and computation of voting rights corresponding
to the affected claims or rights enabling them to cast a vote. The amount of the claims taken into account
for the computation of the voting rights is the one indicated by the debtor and certified by its statutory
auditor or certified public accountant. The methods used are also notified to the court-appointed creditor's
representative. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be brought before the insolvency judge at the
request of the affected party, the debtor, the public prosecutor, the court-appointed creditor's representative
or the judicial administrator.


-----

The restructuring plan will be adopted once each class has voted on it by a two-third majority of the votes
cast. The affected parties must vote within 20 to 30 days following receipt of the draft restructuring plan.
This timeframe may be increased or decreased following a request by the debtor or the judicial administrator
to the insolvency judge but cannot be less than 15 days. Within each class, the vote on the approval of the
plan may be replaced by an agreement from the required majority.

If the draft restructuring plan is approved by all classes under the required conditions and majority rules,
the court will nevertheless have to make sure that certain conditions are met before approving the draft
restructuring plan:

      - the restructuring plan has been approved in accordance with the rules governing the
constitution of classes of affected parties;

      - creditors of the same class sharing sufficient common interests benefit from an equal
treatment and are treated in proportion to their claims or rights;

      - the restructuring plan has been duly notified to all affected parties;

      - in the presence of dissenting creditors, the restructuring plan does not put those dissenting
creditor in a less favorable position than the position they would have been in (i) if the order
of priority of the distribution of asset sale proceeds in judicial liquidation proceedings, or the
sale price of the business as a going concern via an asset sale plan (plan de cession) pursuant
to Article L. 642-1 of the French Commercial Code were to apply or (ii) in the event of a
better alternative solution if the restructuring plan were not to be approved;

      - to the extent applicable any new financing provided for in the restructuring plan is necessary
for its implementation and does not unduly affect (ne porte pas une atteinte excessive aux)
the interests of the affected parties.

Even if these criteria are met, the court may refuse to approve a restructuring plan which does not offer a
reasonable prospect of avoiding the insolvency of the company (state of cessation des paiements) or ensures
business continuity (viabilité de l'entreprise). The court must also ensure that the interests of all affected
parties are sufficiently protected.

When the restructuring plan is not approved by all classes of creditors but only by a majority of (or one of)
them, it may nevertheless be adopted by the court upon request made by the debtor or the judicial
administrator with the consent of the debtor and imposed on the dissenting classes by means of a "crossclass cram down" (application forcée interclasses), provided that the plan meets the above mentioned
conditions along with several additional conditions, including that:

      - the restructuring plan has been approved in accordance with the rules governing the approval
of plans;

      - at least one of the following two criteria is met:

         - a majority of the classes of affected parties voted in favor of the plan, provided that at
least one of those classes is a secured creditors' class or is senior to the ordinary unsecured
creditors' class (créanciers chirographaires);

         - or, if the above criteria cannot be satisfied, at least one of the classes of affected parties,
other than an equity holders' class or any other class which, after determining the value
of the debtor as a going concern, could reasonably be expected not to be entitled to any
payment or retain any interest in the context of a judicial liquidation or an asset sale plan
(plan de cession), has voted favorably;

      - affected creditors of a dissenting class are fully repaid by the same or equivalent means where,
under the plan, a lower ranking class is entitled to a payment or retains an interest
(intéressement) under the restructuring plan (the "absolute priority" rule);


-----

      - no class of affected creditors may receive or maintain more than the total amount of its claims
and interests;

      - when one or more classes of equity holders have been constituted and have not approved the
restructuring plan:

         - the debtor (x) either employs at least 250 employees and has a net turnover of at least
€20 million or (y) has a net turnover of €40 million (such thresholds applying to
companies that own or control another company, within the meaning of Articles L. 2331 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, provided that all the companies together
reach the aforementioned thresholds);

         - based on the value of the debtor as a going concern, one may reasonably assume that the
equity holders of one or several dissenting classes would not be entitled to any payment
or retain any interest in the context of a judicial liquidation or an asset sale plan (plan de
_cession);_

         - the shares issued, if the plan provides for a capital increase subscribed by cash
contribution (which should include a subscription by way of set off), are offered in
priority to the shareholders, pro rata their existing shareholding; and

         - the plan does not provide for the transfer of all or part of the rights of dissenting class or
classes of equity holders.

The court may depart from the "absolute priority" rule, with the agreement of the debtor, where such
derogations are necessary in order to achieve the objectives of the plan and if the plan does not unduly
prejudice (ne porte pas une atteinte excessive aux) the rights or interests of the affected parties. In particular,
suppliers essential to the debtor's business, equity holders or holders of claims arising from the debtor's tort
liability are eligible for special treatment.

The court decision will constitute approval of the changes to the shareholding or to the rights of the equity
holders or to the constitutional documents provided for in the restructuring plan. The court may designate
a judicial mandataire to register in the debtor's books the changes to the share capital and to carry out all
acts necessary for the implementation of such amendments.

**_Accelerated Safeguard Proceedings_**

A debtor that is engaged in conciliation proceedings may request the commencement of accelerated
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée).

The accelerated safeguard proceedings has been designed to "fast-track" the treatment of difficulties faced
by companies and corresponds to the proceeding in which the approval of a plan by classes of affected
parties is mandatory, as imposed by Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 20 June 2019.

The maximum duration of accelerated safeguard proceedings is four months (provided the court has decided
to extend the initial two-month period).

The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard
proceedings. However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by
their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard proceedings.

When the accounts show that the nature of the indebtedness makes it likely that a plan will be adopted only
by creditors having the status of finance companies, credit institutions and the like, as well as by all holders
of claims acquired from them or from a supplier of goods or services and, if applicable, bondholders, the
debtor may request the opening of an accelerated safeguard proceeding, the effects of which shall be limited
to these creditors.


-----

If the debtor does not meet the conditions that require affected parties' classes (classes de parties affectées)
(see above) to be constituted, the court shall authorize such constitution in the opening decision and the
class-based consultation shall apply (see "Safeguard Proceedings").

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions:

      - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applies for
commencement of conciliation proceedings;

      - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the
commencement of the proceedings;

      - its accounts are certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public accountant;

      - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is
not in a position to overcome; and

      - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business
as a going concern which is likely to be supported by enough of its affected parties (parties
_affectées) so as to make the approval of the plan probable during the proceedings._

If a plan is not approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court will terminate the proceedings.

**_Judicial Reorganization or Liquidation Proceedings_**

General

Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) proceedings may be
initiated against (including at the request of a creditor) or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, in the case
of liquidation proceedings only, if the debtor's recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is required to
petition for judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (or for conciliation proceedings, as discussed
above) within 45 days of becoming insolvent; de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may
be, de facto managers that would have failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil
liability.

Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after
having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may
order the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same would
apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court
considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time
during the safeguard proceedings observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors' representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the public prosecutor, the court may
convert safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings or liquidation proceedings if it
appears that the debtor was already insolvent at the time of the court decision opening the proceedings. In
all cases, the court's decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator,
the creditors' representative, the public prosecutor and the workers' representatives (if any).

As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount
of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

Judicial Reorganization

The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation
of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order.

An administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of
the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and make proposals for the
reorganization of the debtor (by assisting the debtor in the preparation of a draft judicial reorganization plan,
which is similar to a draft safeguard plan or organizing the sale of the business by way of an asset sale plan
(plan de cession)). At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the


-----

court- appointed administrator, the creditors' representative (mandataire judiciaire), the public prosecutor
or at its own initiative, order the partial cessation of the business (cessation partielle de l'activité) or order
the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. The court-appointed administrator will
assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d'assistance) or may be empowered by the court
to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d'administration). Judicial reorganization
proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to
certain specificities, including the following:

      - the plan is prepared and presented by the judicial administrator (with the assistance of the
company as regards its preparation);

      - in case of a class-based consultation:

         - any affected party may prepare an alternative plan which shall be reported on by the
judicial administrator and presented to the vote simultaneously with the plan prepared by
the company provided that such alternative plan has been provided to the debtor and the
judicial administrator at least 15 days before the date of the vote on the draft plan presented
by the company;

         - if the plan is not approved by all classes any affected party may request from the court that
it approves the plan by way of a cross class cram-down; and

         - if the court does not approve the plan, a new plan must be prepared and standard
consultation shall apply (including the court-imposed rescheduling described in
"Safeguard Proceedings").

In judicial reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders' meeting needs to vote to bring the
shareholders' equity (capitaux propres) to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital (capital
_social) as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the administrator may request from_
the court the appointment of a trustee (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders' meeting and to
vote on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring
plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with
the reorganization plan.

In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls one or
more companies having together at least 150 employees (within the meaning of the French Labor Code),
(ii) the disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy
and to local employment and (iii) the modification of the company's share capital seems to be the only
credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the
business as a going concern, then, at the request of the judicial administrator or of the State prosecutor (x)
after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least three months have
elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders' meetings
required to approve the modification of the company's share capital required for adoption of the
reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either:

      - appoint a trustee (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders' meeting and vote the
share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount
provided for in the reorganization plan; or

      - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the
sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital
modification and holding, directly or indirectly, a portion of the share capital providing them
with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other
shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company's shareholders' meetings; any consent
clause being deemed unwritten, the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the
company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees.

In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the
parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings.


-----

In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new
shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration
of the reorganization plan.

Judicial Liquidation

If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which
is generally the former creditors' representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in
judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified
judicial liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and
perform the liquidation operations (mainly to liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the
proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors' priority order of
payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the
debtor are no longer in charge of its management.

Disposal of the debtor's assets will take place as follows:

      - a sale of business (cession d'entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator
(administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary
period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months,
renewable once) and organize such sale of the business as a going concern via an asset sale
(i.e., an asset sale plan (plan de cession)), any third party (as construed under French law)
being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor's business); or

      - a piecemeal sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide
to:

         - launch auction sales (vente aux enchères and adjudication amiable for real estate assets
only);

         - sell by private sale (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers
have been received (the formal authorization of the insolvency judge being necessary to
enter into the sale agreement with the bidder); or

         - in practice, request, under the supervision of the insolvency judge, all potential interested
purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive
process whereby bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed
prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the
possibility to implement such process is questioned by certain legal authors and case law
in this respect has varied.

If the court adopts a reorganization or sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it
deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain and the liquidator has sufficient
funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif) or continuation of the liquidation process becomes
impossible due to an insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d'actif).

The court may also terminate the proceedings:

      - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared
to the difficulty of selling the assets; or

      - in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a
_mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received_
from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.


-----

**_The Observation Period and its Outcome_**

The period from the date of the court decision commencing the safeguard or judicial reorganization
proceedings and until the court makes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings is called the observation
period (période d'observation) and may last up to twelve months (with six additional months for judicial
reorganization proceedings under exceptional circumstances and upon request of the public prosecutor).
During the observation period, the court-appointed administrator investigates the business of the company.

Under safeguard proceedings, the court-appointed administrator's mission is limited to either supervising
the debtor's management or assisting it, and in any case helping it prepare a safeguard plan for the company.
In judicial reorganization proceedings, the court-appointed administrator's mission is usually to assist the
management and to make proposals for the reorganization of the company, which proposals may include a
reorganization or an asset sale plan. In judicial reorganization proceedings, the court may also decide that
the court-appointed administrator will manage the company alone by replacing the debtor's management.

At the end of the observation period, if it concludes that the company can survive as a going concern, the
court will adopt a safeguard or a reorganization plan, which will essentially provide for a restructuring
and/or rescheduling of debts which may only entail the partial divesture of assets rather than the entire
business, to a third party (a sale of the entire business is not possible under safeguard proceedings). At the
end of the observation period of judicial reorganization proceedings and, alternatively to a reorganization
plan, the court may determine that all or part of the business should be sold to purchasers who have
submitted bids. In such a case, the court orders such a (partial or entire) sale in the framework of a so-called
"asset sale plan" (plan de cession), which consists of transferring assets, contracts and employees cherrypicked by the purchaser thereto, for a lump sum, in accordance with the bid submitted by the purchaser
during the observation period.

Judicial liquidation proceedings entail the relief of the debtor's management and there is no observation
period in such proceedings. The outcome of liquidation proceedings, which is decided by the court without
a vote of the creditors, may be a sale of the business and/or isolated sales of the debtor's assets in order to
discharge the debtor's liabilities. Where a sale of the business (partial or not) is contemplated, the court may
authorize a temporary continuation of the business for a maximum period of three months (renewable once
for a period of three months at the public prosecutor's request) whose effects are similar to an observation
period.

The sales that have been pre-packed in mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings and that are deemed
satisfactory will be implemented in the framework of subsequent court-administered proceedings through
an expeditious process. Such sale could only relate to part (but not all) of the business of the debtor in
safeguard proceedings.

**_The "Hardening Period" (Période Suspecte) in Judicial Reorganization and Liquidation Proceedings_**

The date when the debtor becomes in a state of "cessation des paiements" is deemed to be the date of the
court order commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets
an earlier date, which may not be earlier than 18 months before the date of such court order. Also, except
in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court
decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above).
The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the "hardening period" (période
_suspecte), being the period from the insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the_
judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings affecting it.

Certain transactions entered into by the debtor during the hardening period are automatically void or
voidable by the court.

Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period
that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors.
These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which
the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed those of the other party, payments of debts not due at the
time of payment, payments of the debts that are due made in a manner which is not commonly used in the
ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that has
not yet become final to serve as bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with Article 2350 of the


-----

French Civil Code, any security interest agreement or right of retention agreement granted on the debtor's
assets or rights for debts previously contracted unless they replace a previous security with at least an
equivalent nature and basis and with the exception of the assignments of receivables provided under Article
L. 313-23 of the French Monetary and Financial Code made in execution of a framework agreement entered
into prior to the date of insolvency, any legal mortgage (hypothèque légale) resulting from a judgment
against the debtor for debts previously incurred, provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures
_conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to_
stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is
made as security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that
affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment,
and notarised declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d'insaisissabilité) pursuant to
Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code.

Voidable transactions include, transactions for consideration, payments made on debts that are due, notices
of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions,
in each case, if such actions are taken after the debtor was in _cessation des paiements_ and the court
determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. In
addition, transactions relating to transfers of assets for no consideration and notarised declarations of
exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d'insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French
Commercial Code are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning
of the hardening period.

There is no hardening period prior to the opening of safeguard proceedings, since the condition required to
commence such proceedings is that the company is not insolvent within the meaning of French law.

**_Extension of Insolvency Proceedings_**

French law provides that, upon the petition of the debtor, the public prosecutor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors' representative, the controllers or the liquidator, the insolvency proceedings of
a company may be extended to another one, so that their respective assets and liabilities will be treated as
belonging to one single insolvency estate, if (i) the debtor is deemed "fictitious" (i.e., a sham), or (ii) the
debtor "commingled its assets and liabilities" with another entity (i.e., either it proves impossible to
determine which assets and liabilities belong to each of them or "abnormal financial relationships" existed
between the two entities (such as transfers of assets or funds without consideration)).

**_Status of Creditors During Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings_**

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the proceedings triggers the acceleration
of the debt (except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the court does not order the
continued operation of the business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract are not
enforceable against the debtor. Nor are "contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of
an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the
opening of judicial reorganization proceedings" (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court
(Cour de Cassation) dated January 14, 2014, n° 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to
safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed administrator can
unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) that it believes the debtor will not be
able to continue to perform. This possibility is excluded in the case of an accelerated safeguard. Conversely,
the court-appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their
obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully
performs its post-commencement contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of judicial
reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor
pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates
the maturity of all of a debtor's obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business
with a view to the adoption of an asset sale plan (plan de cession) as described above; in such case, the
acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the asset sale plan
(plan de cession), as described above, or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends.

During the observation period (and some of these rules continue to apply during the execution of the
approved plan):


-----

      - accrual of interest is suspended (except in respect of loans having a maturity of at least one
year, or of contracts providing for a payment which is deferred by at least one year (however,
accrued interest can no longer be compounded);

      - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the
proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related
(connexes) debts and payments authorized by the insolvency judge (juge-commissaire) to
recover assets required by the continued operation of the business and post-petition debts,
unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or
in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor;

      - debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which were incurred for
the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services
rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall
due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the
proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a "New Money Lien"),
provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the court-appointed administrator or,
failing one, the mandataire judiciaire or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the
commissioner of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l'exécution du plan) or
the judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period;

      - in the context of judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to
other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing
contract (contrat en cours) will be required;

      - creditors may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or against
a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person and the proceedings are
safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings) with respect to any claim arising prior to the
court decision commencing the proceedings if the objective of such legal action is:

      - to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the
creditor may require that a court determine the amount due) in order to file a proof of claim,
as described below)

      - to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed to the creditor; or

      - to enforce the creditor's rights against any assets of the debtor, except (i) in judicial liquidation
proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution
_judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset—whether tangible or intangible,_
moveable or immoveable, is located in another Member State within the European Union, in
which case the rights _in rem_ of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency
proceedings, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation; and

      - any increase in the scope of a contractual security or a contractual right of retention, by any
means whatsoever, by the inclusion of goods or rights, or by transfer of the debtor's assets or
rights, is prohibited. Any contrary provision, in particular relating to a transfer of property or
rights of the debtor which have not yet arisen on the date of decision commencing the
proceedings, is unenforceable as from the date of the court decision opening the relevant
proceedings. However, the increase in the scope may validly result from an assignment of a
claim under Article L. 313-23 of the French Monetary and Financial Code when it is made
pursuant to a master assignment agreement entered into prior to the opening of the
proceedings, or from an express derogation from this prohibition provided for in the French
Monetary and Financial Code or the French Insurance Code.

A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan
and of a judicial reorganization plan adopted by the court.

In accelerated safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope
of those proceedings. Debts owed to other creditors continue to be payable in the ordinary course of
business.


-----

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of courtadministered proceedings must file a proof of claim (déclaration de créances) with the creditors'
representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in the _Bulletin Officiel des_
_annonces civiles et commerciales_ (by exception, the deadline starts upon receipt of an individual
notification for those creditors whose claim arose out of a published contract or who benefit from a
published security interest); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France.
Where the debtor has informed the creditors' representative of the existence of a claim and no proof of a
claim has been filed yet, such claim is deemed filed with the creditors' representative. Creditors are allowed
to confirm a proof of claim made on their behalf. Creditors who have not submitted their claims during the
relevant period, whose claims are not deemed filed with the creditors' representative save for a ratification
by the creditor of a proof of claim made on its behalf, are barred, except with respect to very limited
exceptions, from receiving distributions made in accordance with the proceedings. Employees are not
subject to such limitations and are preferential creditors under French law.

Under accelerated safeguard proceedings the claims held by parties affected (parties affectées) that took
part in the conciliation proceedings are listed by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditor (or, in its
absence, its accountant) and are thus deemed to have been filed. This list should include among other
information, the subordination agreements brought to the debtor's attention by the creditors before the
opening of the proceeding. Although such affected parties (parties affectées) can file proofs of claim
pursuant to the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely
adjust the amounts of their claims as set forth on the list prepared by the debtor (within the 2 or 4 month
time limit). Those affected parties (parties affectées) who did not take part in the conciliation proceedings
would have to file their proofs of claim within the above-mentioned deadlines.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, an accelerated safeguard plan or a reorganization plan, claims of
creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan.

If the court adopts an asset sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or liquidation
proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of the creditors
according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor,
the court will appoint a liquidator in charge of selling the assets of the company and settling the relevant
debts in accordance with their ranking.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employee
claims, post-commencement legal costs (essentially court-officials fees), creditors who benefit from a New
Money Lien or a Post Commencement Lien (see above) and the French State (taxes and social charges). In
the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose
claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to creditors who benefit from a Post Commencement Lien.
This order of priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting
from a retention right over certain assets with respect to their claim related to such asset.

**_Creditors' Liability_**

Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code (as interpreted by case law), where safeguard,
judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may only be
held liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor on the following grounds: (i)
fraud; (ii) clear interference with the management (immixtion caractérisée dans la gestion) of the debtor;
or (iii) if the security or guarantees taken to support the facilities are disproportionate to such facilities. In
addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable
on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court. Case law has recently set out that this
liability would also require that the granting of the facility be deemed wrongful.

If a creditor has repeatedly interfered in the company's management, it can be deemed a de facto manager
of such company (dirigeant de fait). In such case, Article L.651-2 of the French Commercial Code provides
that, if liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) have been commenced against the debtor, the
creditor may be liable for bearing the excess of liabilities over the company's assets, along with the other
managers (whether de jure or de facto), as the case may be, if it is established that their mismanagement
contributed to the company's shortfall of assets. If such conditions are met, French courts will decide
whether the managers should bear all or part of the shortfall amount.


-----

However, a manager (whether de jure or de facto) cannot be held liable on the basis of Article L. 651-2 of
the French Commercial Code in cases of "simple negligence" (simple négligence) in the management of
the company.

**Limitations on Enforcement**

**Limitations on Enforcement of Guarantees**

The liabilities and obligations of each French Guarantor under its Guarantee and the enforcement of each
such Note Guarantee issued by a French Guarantor are subject to limitations and defenses applicable to
guarantees under the laws of France. These limitations and defenses may include those that relate to certain
exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations which would constitute prohibited financial assistance
within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Code de Commerce, capital maintenance or thin
capitalization rules, fiduciary duties and civil or criminal liabilities of the directors of such French
Guarantor (including infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French
_Code de Commerce) and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. In addition, the_
Note Guarantees of the French Guarantors will also be limited so that the granting of such Note Guarantee
would not be against the relevant French Guarantor's corporate benefit. Existence of corporate benefit is a
factual matter which must be determined on a case-by-case basis, and we cannot be certain as to the standard
a French court would use to determine the French Guarantor's corporate benefit, any limit on the applicable
Guarantee or whether such Note Guarantee would be deemed void.

Under French financial assistance rules, a company incorporated as a _société anonyme or a_ _société par_
_actions simplifiée is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly_
or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition.

Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the
transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could subordinate or
declare any guarantee or security unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant
guarantee or security, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor or security
provider, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a real and adequate corporate
benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received
are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

Accordingly, the Note Guarantees of the French Guarantors will contain language limiting the debt
guaranteed to an amount that will not violate applicable French law restrictions. In particular, the aggregate
obligations and liabilities under the Guarantee of each French Guarantor issued on the Issue Date will be
limited to the portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, if any, that are lent (directly or
indirectly) to such French Guarantor, or to subsidiaries of such French Guarantor under intercompany loans
or similar arrangements or used to refinance any indebtedness previously on-lent directly or indirectly to
that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries, and to the extent such on-loans or similar arrangements
remain outstanding at the time of a demand is made under such Note Guarantees. In case the proceeds of
the Notes are used to refinance (directly or indirectly) any indebtedness previously on lent directly or
indirectly to a French Guarantor or its controlled subsidiaries through the intercompany loans, such
intercompany loans would be maintained (and their termination date would be extended) due to the
incurrence by such French Guarantor of obligations and liabilities under its Guarantee. It is specified that
any payment made by any such French Guarantor under its Guarantee shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding
amount of the intercompany loans due by such French Guarantor under the intercompany loan arrangements
referred to above and any repayment of the intercompany loans by such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries
shall reduce pro tanto the amount payable by the French Guarantor under its Guarantee. Any amount that
is lent to any French Guarantor will vary over time depending on the needs of the French Guarantor, and
there can be no assurance as to the amount that will have actually been lent and not repaid by a French
Guarantor as of any date on which the related Guarantee may be called upon.

In light of the foregoing, a French Guarantor's liability under its Guarantee (as the same is limited in
accordance with the above description) could be materially reduced or eliminated. Accordingly, certain of
the French Guarantors (in particular those to which no proceeds of the Notes are on-lent) are unlikely to
have significant liability under their guarantees of the Notes, and may have no liability, in the event the
guarantees are called upon.


-----

It is also possible that a French Guarantor, or a creditor of a French Guarantor, or the bankruptcy trustee in
the case of a bankruptcy of a French Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the French
Guarantor's Guarantee on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that such
Note Guarantee should be limited or voided.

In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is
less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an
arm's-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm's length
transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.

_Limitations on enforcement of security interests and cash amount (soulte)_

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due
and unpaid to it. Under French law, pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities
account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced
at the option of the secured creditors either (i) before a court, (a) by way of a sale of the pledged securities
in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (b) by way of judicial
foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or (ii) to the extent provided for in the relevant security document and
not otherwise prohibited by law, contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to
the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged
securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure
or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the
foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial attribution or
by a pre-contractually agreed or appointed by a judge expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. In
proceedings regarding an attribution judiciaire or a pacte commissoire, an expert is appointed to value the
Collateral (in this case, the pledged assets) (such valuation being made by reference to the date of
enforcement) and if the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured liabilities under the pledge,
the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference
between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured liabilities under the
pledge. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor
from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral.

On the contrary, if the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured liabilities under the
pledge, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value
of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with
applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through such public auction procedures, it is possible that
the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will
not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and
controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the
purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.

If the Security Agent enforces the Collateral pursuant to option (ii) described above, there is a risk that the
secured creditors may not be able to re-sell the Collateral for its full value as determined by the expert, yet
may still be required to pay the pledgor, upon the Security Agent having become the owner of the Collateral,
the difference between the value of the Collateral and the amount of the secured debt if the Collateral is
determined by the expert to have a greater value than the amount of secured debt.

In addition, enforcement of the Note Guarantees may be subject to constraints in relation to the ownership
of companies operating clinical laboratories, such as French restrictions aiming at preventing conflicts of
interest, or rules restricting the concentration of the supply of clinical laboratory services, as provided under
the French Public Health Code.

Further, in view of the area of activity of the Group or certain members of the Group, it should be noted
that foreign investments in French companies or businesses which operate in certain "sensitive" sectors
under the French Monetary and Financial Code (where their activities relate to equipment, products or
services which are critical to the interests of France in terms of public order, public safety or national
security, including but not limited to public health) may require the prior authorization of the French
authorities. This requirement may interfere with the enforcement of the Collateral consisting of shares or a
business.


-----

Where the French company is involved in a sensitive sector, the following shall constitute foreign
investments which are subject to the prior authorization procedure:

  - A transaction as a result of which a non-French entity or a French entity under the control of a
non-French entity) (i) acquires the control (within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French
Commercial Code) or (ii) acquires all or part of a standalone business activity (branche d'activité),
in each case of an entity governed by French law. It is anticipated the French foreign investment
control regime will be amended by end of 2023 to not only cover investments in legal entities
governed by French law, but also investments in French branches of foreign companies.

  - A transaction as a result of which a non-EU/EEA investor (or a French/EU/EEA entity under the
control of a non-EU/EEA entity) crosses, directly or indirectly, the threshold of 25% of the voting
rights of a non-listed French entity or of 10% of the voting rights of a French company which
shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market in France, the European Union, or in an EEA
State (the 10% restriction currently applies until December 31, 2023, but is expected to become a
permanent restriction). This type of foreign investment in France (i.e., the crossing of the 10/25%
threshold) therefore is not applicable to an individual who is a national of an EU Member State or
of an EEA State that has entered into a mutual administrative assistance agreement with France
for the purpose of combating tax evasion and tax avoidance, and who is domiciled in one of these
States, or to an entity in which all the members of the chain of control are governed by the law of
one of these States or are nationals of and domiciled in one of these States.

Each foreign entity or person in the investor's chain of control will be considered a foreign investor.A
French investor under non-French control, or a French ultimate investor with a foreign investor within its
chain of control may therefore be subject to the French foreign direct investment control regime.

When a foreign investment is subject to the authorization of the French authorities as above, the transaction
cannot be completed prior to authorization. The foreign investor must submit a formal application for prior
authorization to the French authorities, which shall render a decision within a period of 30 business days of
receipt of the complete application, followed by a second 45 business days period if further examination is
deemed necessary. In the absence of answer at the end of the relevant period, the authorization request will
be deemed implicitly rejected. The French authorities may grant such prior authorization with or without
specific commitments imposed on the foreign investor.

We can provide no assurance that the approval of the French authorities would not be required in order to
allow the enforcement of the Collateral consisting of shares or a business or that such approval, where
required, would be granted.

_Parallel Debt_

Under French law, certain "accessory" security interests such as pledges require that the pledgee and the
creditor be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held by third parties who do not hold the
secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as
security agent under Article 2488-6 et seq. of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des sûretés)
under Articles 2488-6 et. seq. of the French Civil Code (as modified by Ordinance n°2017-748 of May 4,
2017, which came into force on October 1, 2017). In our case, the beneficial holders of interest in the Notes
from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. Instead, the Intercreditor Agreement
provides for the creation of a "parallel debt" in favor of the Security Agent directly. Pursuant to the parallel
debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under
the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure
the parallel debt,and will not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness
secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect
of such security interests except through the Security Agent. Although the enforceability in France of
certain rights (the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a parallel
debt was recognized for the first time by the French Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation) on September 13,
2011 (Cass. Com. 13 September 2011 n° 10-25.533 Belvédère), there is no assurance that such a structure
will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, this decision was relating to a bond
documentation governed by the laws of the state of New York. Such a decision recognized the
enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filling of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a
security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. This decision cannot be considered as a general recognition
of enforceability in France of the right of a security agent benefiting from a parallel debt obligation and no


-----

assurance can be given that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. In particular,
the French Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation) upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel
Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy _(ordre public_
_international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double_
payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt mechanism.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as
creditor of the Parallel Debt under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other
parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to rely on the Parallel Debt construction to receive on the
basis of such construction any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In
addition, under a parallel debt construction, the holders of the Notes bear the risks associated with the
possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.The Trustee
has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important following
Defaults or Events of Default,and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders
of the Notes.

The concept of "trust" has been recognized for tax purposes by Article 792 bis of the French Code général
_des impôts and the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published_
decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011, n°10-25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly
appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a
creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while certain comfort may be derived
from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985, on the law applicable to
trusts and on their recognition, and two _réponses ministérielles_ dated January 24, 2008, and January 8,
2009, indicated its reluctance to do so to avoid conflicts between the "trust" and the French fiducie, so that
the concept of "trust" has not been generally recognized under French law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created for the benefit of the Trustee are
successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis
any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the
Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Trustee.

_Recognition of Intercreditor Arrangements by French Courts_

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme Court (Cour
_de cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the Intercreditor_
Agreement, except for Article L. 626-30 of the French Commercial Code which states that the judicial
administrator shall ensure that the determination of classes of affected parties complies with the
subordination arrangements entered into before the opening of the relevant proceedings (provided that these
subordination arrangements have been provided to the judicial administrator within 10 days of receipt of
the notice sent by the judicial administrator or the publication of such notice inviting the affected parties to
notify the existence of such arrangements). As a consequence, except to the extent referred to above, we
cannot rule out that a French court would not give effect to certain provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

_Lower Ranking Security in France_

The Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents provide for a mechanism allowing the
implementation of second or lower ranking pledges.

Although there is no express prohibition under French law on granting a lower-ranking pledge over a
securities account in which the shares or other securities of a French company are registered, some legal
commentators have queried whether a lower-ranking pledge is legally permissible to the extent that a pledge
of a securities account is deemed, under French law, to confer a retention right (droit de rétention) over the
securities credited on the securities account, thereby preventing such grantor from granting a further lowerranking pledge thereon. Consequently, no assurance can be given that a court would concur with the view
that a lower ranking pledge over securities account is valid. Therefore, there is a risk that the second or
lower ranking pledge over the securities account in which the shares of such company are respectively
registered may be held void or unenforceable by a French court, which in turn could materially adversely
affect the recovery under the Notes or Note Guarantees (as applicable) following an enforcement event.


-----

A pledge over the shares of a stock company (société par actions) governed by French law is a pledge over
the relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the shares of such
company are registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not
registered, such as pledges over securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres financiers). As a
result, no assurance can be given on the priority of a pledge over a securities account in which the shares
of such a company are registered. Moreover, in France, as mentioned above, no lien searches are available
for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over receivables/bank accounts. As a result,
no assurance can be given on the priority of the pledges over the receivables/bank accounts of a company.

Although French law does not expressly prohibit the grantor of a pledge over receivables/bank accounts
from granting a second ranking pledge or lower ranking pledge over the same receivables/bank accounts,
this structure has not been tested before the French courts and no assurances can be given that such second
ranking pledges or lower ranking pledges would be upheld if tested.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance_**

French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside insolvency
proceedings, the so-called action paulienne provisions. The action paulienne offers creditors protection
against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without
limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such person guarantees the performance of the obligations of a
third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such debtor's or a third party's obligations,
enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security or any other legal act having similar
effect) can be challenged, in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant person, by the creditors'
representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or reorganization plan
(commissaire à l'exécution du plan) insolvency proceedings of the relevant person, or, in or outside
insolvency proceedings, by any of the creditors of the relevant person who was prejudiced in its means of
recovery as a consequence of the act. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against third parties
if: (i) the person performed such acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case
of the person's insolvency proceedings) any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a
consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the legal act was performed, both the person and the counterparty
to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such person's creditors (existing or future)
would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (à titre
_gratuit), in which case no such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the_
issuance or granting of a Note Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any
defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes or the granting of such Note Guarantee could
be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged
the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may
not enjoy the benefit of the Notes or the guarantees thereof and the value of any consideration that holders
of the Notes received with respect to the Notes or the guarantees thereof could also be subject to recovery
from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such
circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors
of the Company or the Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.

**Germany**

Certain Guarantors (e.g., the Target and the other German Guarantors) are organized under the laws of
Germany, have their registered offices in Germany and substantially all of their assets are located in
Germany. Consequently, any insolvency proceedings with regard to the German Guarantors are likely to
be initiated in Germany if the German Guarantor was held to have its "centre of main interests" (as such
term is described in Article 3 (1) of the Regulation (EU) No. 848/2015 of 20 May 2015 on Insolvency
Proceedings) within the territory of Germany at the time the application for the opening of insolvency
proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed and German insolvency law would most likely govern
such proceedings. The following German insolvency considerations will also apply to other entities
(including the Issuer) if they are considered to have their "centre of main interests" in Germany. The
insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other
jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors' claims, the ability to obtain post-petition
interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit your ability to recover
payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.


-----

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite
the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate
insolvency proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the
part of the relevant entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other
insolvency proceedings (if any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and
liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective
entities of a group. The German Insolvency Code does however provide for certain mechanisms designed
to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each
group entity insolvency proceedings; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for
all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts,
insolvency administrators and creditors' committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for "coordination
proceedings" (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a "coordination insolvency administrator"
(Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a "coordination plan" (Koordinationsplan).

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court
ex officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings.
Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of overindebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor (i.e., where its liabilities exceed the value of its assets) unless
the debtor's business is predominantly likely to continue as a going concern (positive
_Fortführungsprognose) or in the event that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due_
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit). As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or more of
its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless it is virtually certain that the
company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be deemed acceptable to the
creditor to further await the payments owed by such debtor. In addition, the debtor can file for insolvency
proceedings if it is imminently at risk of being unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit). If a legal entity (juristische Person) becomes illiquid and/or over-indebted, the_
management of such legal entity and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders, are obligated to file for
the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, or at the latest within three weeks or six weeks
respectively after the mandatory insolvency reason, (i.e., illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness) has occurred.
Noncompliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as well as
sanctions under criminal law. In addition, the debtor can file for insolvency proceedings if it is imminently
at risk to be unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit). However,
in that case, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of
insolvency proceedings.

If the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency reason
other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate
such process based on debtor-in-possession status and can prove that a restructuring of its business is not
obviously futile, the court may grant a period of up to three months to prepare an insolvency plan for the
debtor business (Schutzschirm).

During the debtor-in-possession proceedings it also has to be ensured that the debtor is willing and able to
adapt its management to the interests of the creditors. Therefore, German insolvency law requires debtorin-possession planning as a filing condition. The debtor-in-possession plan consists of the following
components:

  - a financial plan for the period of six months, confirming that the costs of the proceedings will be
covered in addition to the costs of continuing business operations. The plan must also set out the
sources of financing;

  - a concept for the implementation of the debtor-in-possession proceedings, in which in particular
the extent and causes of the crisis are analyzed and necessary measures for overcoming it are
determined;

  - a report on the status of negotiations with creditors, shareholders and third parties;

  - a description of the precautions taken by the debtor to fulfil its obligations under insolvency law;


-----

##### • a substantiated description of the additional or reduced costs of debtor-in-possession proceedings
compared to regular insolvency proceedings. (Prognostic) advisor and court costs must also be
taken into account;

The depth of the presentation and the degree of detail are to be determined in each individual case and
depend on the size and the specific circumstances of the debtor.

During the three months period (Schutzschirm) described above, the creditors' rights to enforce security
may – upon application of the filing debtor – be suspended. Under these circumstances, the insolvency
court must appoint a custodian (Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an
individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless
the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or
impartial).

The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take
preliminary measures (vorläufige Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary
proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures
taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor's assets during these preliminary proceedings. In
addition, the court will also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger
_Insolvenzverwalter) unless the debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) –_
an insolvency process in which the debtor's management generally remains in charge of administering the
debtor's business affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter) – and this petition is not
obviously futile. Depending on the size of the debtor's business operations, the insolvency court must, or
may appoint a preliminary creditors' committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) to, form a view on the
profile of the officeholder to be appointed or to suggest a particular individual be appointed by the court. If
the members of the preliminary creditors' committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion
is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible (i.e., incompetent and/or not
impartial)). To ensure that the preliminary creditors' committee reflects the interests of all creditor
constituencies, it shall comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large creditors and
one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The duties of the preliminary insolvency
administrator are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor's assets (which includes the
continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency reason and
to assess whether the debtor's net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings.
The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes
_Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, particularly if there are sufficient assets to cover at_
least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the
insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors) advance the
costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (usually the same person
who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court unless debtor-inpossession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) are ordered. In the absence of debtor-in-possession proceedings,
the right to administer the debtor's business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the
insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to change
the individual appointed as insolvency administrator upon the occasion of the first creditors' meeting (erste
_Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by head count_
and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual becoming the insolvency
administrator and (ii) the proposed individual is eligible as officeholder (i.e., he or she is sufficiently
qualified, business-experienced and impartial). The insolvency administrator may raise new financial
indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor's business. These new liabilities incurred by
the insolvency administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten)
which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured
insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as
unsecured insolvency claim).

From the perspective of the holders of the Notes, among others, some important consequences of such
opening of formal insolvency proceedings against any German Guarantor who may be subject to the
German insolvency regime would be the following:


-----

  - the right to administer and dispose of the assets of any German Guarantor would generally pass to
the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate,
unless debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) are ordered;

##### • if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to any
German Guarantor, disposals effected by the management of any German Guarantor, after the
opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of law;

##### • if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a
creditor in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security
interest in part of any German Guarantor's property that would normally form part of the
insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of
formal insolvency proceedings;

  - claims against any German Guarantor may only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth
in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

##### • any person that has a right for segregation (Aussonderung) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person
does not constitute part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency
proceedings; the claim for segregation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court
proceedings against the insolvency administrator.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), wishing
to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German
insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their
individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance
with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled
to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however,
secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of
the security interest entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the
insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has
the sole right to realize any movable assets in his, her or the debtor's possession which are subject to
preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or security transfer of title
(Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment
agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) has
decided that the secured creditor is entitled to initiate enforcement of preferential rights
(Absonderungsrechte) with respect to IP pledges (and general view of legal literature is that this shall also
be the case for pledges over shares or company interests) forming part of the insolvency estate. If the
enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain
contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realising
the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross
enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any), are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the
relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of
the debtor the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger)
first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the
insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims
(insolvency claims (Insolvenzforderungen)), particularly claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on
a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvent estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the
security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full. Therefore,
the proceeds resulting from the realization of the insolvency estate of the debtor may not be sufficient to
satisfy unsecured creditors of any German Guarantor in full after secured creditors (if any) have been
satisfied.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the
insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency
administrator must, however, compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use.


-----

Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be
subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the
relevant debtor for the return of funds or the payment of a consideration), while claims of a person who
become a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings
(Massegläubiger) generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Under certain
circumstances, restrictive covenants and undertakings in finance documents may result in the relevant
creditor being considered to hold a "shareholder-like position" (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung) in the
relevant debtor, guarantor or grantor of security. In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets
of such debtor, guarantor or grantor of security, the claims against such debtor, guarantor or grantor of
security would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen) in
accordance with the rules applying to shareholder loans. A third party acquiring the claims that are subject
to the rules of the treatment of shareholder loans (section 135 of the German Insolvency Code) will itself
be exposed to a claw-back risk with respect to repayments that have been made within the period of one
year. Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in insolvency proceedings over the
assets of the debtor (or in any transaction security) unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted
special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the
majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. To the extent any creditor that benefited from the
transaction security was a subordinated creditor, potential sharing and equalisation provisions in the finance
documents could result in holders who are not subordinated suffering a shortfall on the amount they recover.
Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are
satisfied only after the claims of other unsubordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims)
have been fully satisfied.

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the
debtor on the date the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking
below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given herein, and in proportion to their amounts
if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency
creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency
creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and
administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offense
binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims on the debtor's gratuitous performance of a consideration; and
(v) claims for the restitution of shareholder loans (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal
transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan.

While in ordinary insolvency proceedings the value of any German Guarantor's assets will be realised by a
piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of any German Guarantor's business as a going concern,
a different approach aimed at the rehabilitation of any German Guarantor can be taken based on an
insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator
and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent
of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court
(while a group of dissenting creditors or the debtor can – under certain circumstances – be crammed down).
The shares in the debtor can also be included in the insolvency plan (e.g., they can be transferred to third
parties, including a transfer to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap). Under certain conditions, such
provisions could be adopted against the votes of the affected holders of the Notes.

**_Effects of Energy Crisis Measures_**

The German legislator has passed several laws aimed at mitigating the effects of the economic crisis caused
by the European energy crisis, which, as of the date of this offering memorandum, include the following:

- **_Management's insolvency filing obligation_**

The maximum insolvency filing period in case of over-indebtedness has been extended from six
to eight weeks until December 31, 2023.

According to the current wording of the applicable emergency law, a forecast period of four months
applies until December 31, 2023 for the review of the going concern forecast within examination
of over-indebtedness. However, according to the accompanying explanatory reasoning of the
German legislation, it must be taken into account that the energy crisis regulation may lose some
of its practical effectiveness even before December 31, 2023: If it is clear for a company less than
four months before December 31, 2023 that it will be over-indebted immediately after


-----

December 31, 2023 under the over-indebtedness concept of section 19 InsO (with a forecast period
of 12 months), this finding may also be relevant for the going concern forecast to be prepared under
the emergency law. The predominant advisory practice and prevailing view in legal literature,
therefore, assumes that from September 1, 2023, a forecast period of 12 months must be applied
as a basis for the examination of going concern within the analysis of over-indebtedness under
German insolvency law.

- **_Financial plan to be delivered under debtor-in-possession insolvency proceedings and the_**
**_Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (as defined below)_**

The period for which the financial plan to be delivered under debtor-in-possession insolvency
proceedings and the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act must confirm that the costs of
the proceedings will be covered in addition to the costs of continuing business operations is reduced
from six to four months until December 31, 2023.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfers_**

Under German insolvency law, an insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession proceedings,
the custodian) may under certain circumstances avoid (anfechten) any transaction, performances or other
acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the
commencement of formal insolvency proceedings during applicable voidable periods. Generally, if
transactions, performances or other acts are successfully voided by the insolvency administrator or
custodian, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will
have to be returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator's or custodian's right to void transactions
can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the
filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings.

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to any German Guarantor based on and governed by
the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the noteholders as well as the granting of
collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes, if any, could be subject to potential
challenges (i.e., claw back rights) by an insolvency administrator or custodian under the rules of avoidance
as set out in the German Insolvency Code. In case the validity or enforceability of the Notes is avoided
successfully, you may not be able to recover any amounts under the Notes. If payments have already been
made under any Note, the insolvency administrator or custodian may require that the recipients return the
payment to the insolvency estate and you would instead then only have a general unsecured claim without
preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the
granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of
the debtor may be voided according to the German Insolvency Code in the following cases:

  - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing
of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid
(zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of
circumstances that clearly suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing
of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor's
illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that clearly suggest such illiquidity or
filing);

  - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or
obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security
or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second
or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time or (iii)
such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the


-----

opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such
act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had acknowledge of circumstances that
clearly suggest such detrimental effect);

  - a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which
the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a
debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior
to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid
at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at
such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the
counterparty to such transaction knew either of the debtor's illiquidity or of such filing at the time
of the transaction;

  - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security for
a third party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)),
if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings;

  - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the
intention of prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the
other party knew of such intention at the time of such act. In case the act in question granted a
creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the hardening period is
reduced to four years. If the creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction, it must have
known of the illiquidity (and not only an impeding illiquidity) of the debtor for its knowledge of
the debtor's intention to prejudice its creditors to be presumed. A creditor that agreed on a payment
plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments is presumed to not have had knowledge of the
illiquidity of the debtor. If the act fulfils the requirements of the cash-consideration-privilege, the
act will only be voidable if the other party knew that the debtor was acting dishonestly;

  - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party that directly
operates to the detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded earlier
than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the
other party had no knowledge of the debtor's intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time
the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term "affiliated party" includes,
subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners
and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor's share capital, persons or companies
holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation
of the debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of
the foregoing persons;

  - any act that provides security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a shareholder loan made to the
debtor or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place during the
ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the
filing of such petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior
to the filing of the petition for the opening of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such
petition;

##### • any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim
to a third party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted
security or was liable as a guarantor or surety (Garant oder Bürge) (in which case the shareholder
must compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, "knowledge" is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which
the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or
intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge


-----

of the debtor's intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor's actual or
imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor's creditors, provided that, if the relevant
act by the debtor consisted of a settlement of an obligation or the grant of a security which was due to be
paid or granted, as the case may be, then the knowledge of the debtor's intention to prejudice the insolvency
creditors is only presumed if the other party was aware of the actual illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of
the debtor and of the fact that the transaction prejudiced the debtor's creditors. With respect to an "affiliated
party," there is a general statutory presumption that such party had "knowledge."

The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a "cash transaction"
and may as such be privileged – under certain circumstances – under the German Insolvency Code
(Bargeschäftsprivileg) by not being subject to certain avoidance rights.

In addition, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void
any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right according to the German Code
on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a
certain extent from the rules described above and the voidable periods are calculated from the date a creditor
exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the claims held by the personal creditors against the debtor on
the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking
below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion of
their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the
insolvency creditors from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by
individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines,
coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or
administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor's gratuitous performance
of a consideration; and (v) claims for repayment of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims
resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan unless a state aid bank or
any of its subsidiaries which is a shareholder of the relevant company have granted the respective loan or
legal transaction corresponding in economic terms to such a loan.

**_Preventive Restructuring Framework_**

On June 20, 2019, the European Parliament and the Council have adopted a new directive, which aims to
ensure that minimum restructuring measures are available in the Member States to enable debtors in
financial distress to solve their problems at an early stage and to avoid insolvency proceedings (Directive
of the European Parliament and the Council EU 2019/1023 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on
discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning
restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (the "Preventive
**Restructuring Directive")).**

In Germany, the Preventive Restructuring Directive was implemented by the law on the Further
Development of the German Restructuring and Insolvency Laws, which became effective on January 1,
2021. An essential part of the law is the introduction of a new Act on a Stabilization and Restructuring
Framework for Enterprises ("Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act"), which establishes a
comprehensive legal framework for out-of-insolvency financial restructurings in Germany. Proceedings
under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act ("Restructuring Proceedings") are initiated
through a notification by the respective debtor to affected creditors or the competent restructuring court
(Anzeige des Restrukturierungsvorhabens).

A debtor can access the new restructuring tools of the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act upon
the occurrence of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which occurs if it is more likely
than not that the debtor will not be able to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over (generally)
the next 24 months. The debtor may (but is not obliged to) alternatively file for regular insolvency
proceedings if the company is imminently illiquid (see above).

Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act do not
necessarily cover all of a debtor's liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the
Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of


-----

the debtor's liabilities (with the exception of employees' claims, including pensions, and claims based on
intentionally committed acts of tort), only certain types (for example, financial liabilities, including the
Notes), or only selected liabilities. In addition and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to
make use of certain legal tools available under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act, the
involvement of the competent restructuring court can be kept to a minimum. The tools available under the
Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act may in the case of a group of companies only be used for
each entity separately, however certain tools may be extended to cover security granted by entities that are
connected entities (verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor.

The core component of the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act is an out-of-insolvency
restructuring of the debtor's liabilities via a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan), including, for
example, by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest rates,maturities of liabilities or covenants.
Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including, for example, a release of) collateral granted
for the benefit of the Notes by the debtor as well as its subsidiaries and parent and sister companies. A
restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved by the
required majority or majorities of a debtors' creditors. The restructuring plan will be voted on in classes.
The adoption of the restructuring plan requires, in principle, that in each class a majority of three-quarters
of the voting rights approve the plan (whereas voting rights are determined by the amount of the claim, the
value of the security and, in the case of share or membership rights, the share of the subscribed capital of
the debtor). However, if more than one class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted and
become binding on creditors if creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, provided certain requirements
are met and the restructuring court confirms the restructuring plan (cross-class cramdown).

The Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the
debtor so as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These
tools include a stabilization order by the restructuring court (which is granted upon the application by the
debtor). Such stabilization order can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The
stabilization order can initially be granted for a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent
orders to extend the stabilization order up to a maximum of eight months subject to certain conditions being
satisfied.

For the Noteholders, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the Corporate
Stabilization and Restructuring Act by a German Guarantor would be the following:

    - the negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no
or only limited review or supervision by a court;

    - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a
period of up to eight months due to a stabilization order;

    - any claims and rights of the Noteholder can be subject to and potentially be compromised by
the restructuring plan (for example, in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal
or interest or a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an
adjustment of the ranking of the security right);

    - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to
Restructuring Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral;
and

    - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any
Noteholder without the consent of each Noteholder (generally, the relevant majority
requirement is 75% of the respective principal amount) and, if the prerequisites for a
cross-class cram-down are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the Noteholders.

Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in
any Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation upon such proceeding being included as a
recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of that regulation. In any other case, the recognition of the restructuring
plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests_**

The granting of guarantees and/or security interests by German Guarantors will be subject to certain
German capital maintenance rules of the German Act regarding Companies with Limited Liability (Gesetz
_betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung) (the "GmbHG") if that Guarantor is incorporated_
in Germany in the legal form of a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter
_Haftung—a "GmbH") or a German limited partnership with a German limited liability company as general_
partner (a "GmbH & Co. KG"). In addition, the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) (the
"AktG") provides for significant limitations for Guarantees if that Guarantor is incorporated in Germany
in the legal form of a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—a "AG") or a German limited
partnership with an AG as its general partner (an "AG & Co. KG"). This also applies to all Subsidiaries of
an AG (i.e., all Subsidiaries of the Target).

As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG ("Sections 30 and 31") prohibit a GmbH from
disbursing its assets to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH's net assets (i.e., assets
minus liabilities and liability reserves) — or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner's net assets
— is or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital). The granting or guarantees
and/or security interests by a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a
direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31.
Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant guarantees or security interests and to provide
security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of
violating Sections 30 and 31 and to limit any potential personal liability of management, it is standard
market practice for credit agreements, indentures, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called
"limitation language" in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a
GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such "limitation language," the beneficiaries of the guarantees or security
interests contractually agree to enforce the guarantees and security interests against the German subsidiary
which is a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG only if and to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the
subsidiary's — or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, in the general partner's — net assets falling below, or
increasing an existing shortfall of, its stated share capital.

Section 57 paragraphs 1 and 3 AktG generally prohibits the granting of distributions and other benefits
(including guarantees and securities in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent
or sister company) by an AG to its shareholders, with the exception of the distribution of the balance sheet
profit (Bilanzgewinn). Obligations under transactions entered into in violation of this prohibition (e.g.,
granting of guarantees or security) must not be performed by the relevant company and are therefore
unenforceable. In addition section 71a AktG provides that the granting of guarantees or security by an AG
which serve the purpose of supporting the acquisition of shares in such stock corporation is in principle
prohibited. In case of a violation such guarantees and security would be void and unenforceable or subject
to a redemption claim against the beneficiary. In order to ensure the validity and enforceability of guarantees
and security granted by subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of an AG or an AG & Co.
KG it is market practice for credit agreements, indentures, guarantees and security documents to contain a
limitation language pursuant to which the guarantee or security is limited to comply with sections 57 AktG
and 71a AktG.

Accordingly, as a matter of German corporate law it is standard that the Indenture and security documents
contain contractual "limitation language" to limit any Guarantees or Collateral, to the extent provided by a
Guarantor and/or security grantor incorporated in Germany as a GmbH, GmbH & Co. KG, AG, or AG &
Co. KG and their Subsidiaries. Pursuant to such limitation language the beneficiaries of any guarantee
and/or security interests agree to enforce against a German Guarantor and/or security grantor which is a
GmbH, GmbH & Co. KG, AG, or AG & Co. KG only to the extent that such enforcement does not lead to
a violation of sections 57, 71 a AktG (in relation to an AG and an AG & Co. KG) or sections 30, 31 GmbHG
(in relation to a GmbH and GmbH & Co. KG), respectively. In each case, this could lead to a situation in
which the respective Guarantee or Collateral granted by such Guarantor or security provider cannot be
enforced at all.

German capital maintenance rules and financial assistance rules are subject to evolving case law. We cannot
assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of German
Guarantors constituted in the form of a GmbH, a GmbH & Co. KG, an AG or an AG & Co. KG, which can
negatively affect the ability of the Issuer to make payment on the Notes or of the German Guarantors to
make payments on the Guarantees or negatively affect the ability to enforce the Collateral.


-----

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called "destructive interference" (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a
situation where a shareholder deprives a GmbH, GmbH & Co. KG, AG, or AG & Co. KG of the liquidity
necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the
enforcement of a Guarantee or any Collateral granted by a German Guarantor. In such case, the amount of
proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. According to a decision
of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to
tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the
debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant Collateral by disregarding the vital interests
of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect
to the granting of Guarantees and/or Collateral by any of the German Guarantors. Furthermore, the
beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of the Guarantee
or Collateral could become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal
Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act
with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation
of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary
of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the Guarantee and/or
Collateral was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

**_Procurement of Obligations_**

The management board of an AG acts in its own discretion and is not bound by instructions from the
shareholders of the AG. Therefore the Issuer cannot ensure the performance of obligations of a subsidiary
incorporated in Germany in the legal form of an AG or AG & Co. KG or any of its subsidiaries and any
undertakings of the Issuer to do so may be unenforceable.

**_Accessory Security Interests/Parallel Debt_**

Under German law, certain security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) are of strict accessory nature
and are therefore dependent on the secured claims and require the security holder and the creditor of the
secured claim to be identical. Such accessory security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) (i) will
automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated, (ii) may not be assigned
independently, but would automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is
assigned and (iii) may only be granted to the creditor of a claim to be secured by the accessory security
interest.

The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the security documents. The
accessory security interests will only be granted to the Security Agent. The Security Agent is however not
a creditor under the Notes. In order to allow the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit from the
pledges under German law, such pledges will also secure a so-called "parallel debt" obligation created
under the Intercreditor Agreement. Pursuant to such parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder
of a claim equal to the sum of any amounts payable by any obligors under, in particular, the Notes and the
Indenture (the "Parallel Debt Obligation"). The pledges governed by German law will directly and
exclusively (to the extent the notes are concerned) secure the Parallel Debt Obligation, rather than secure
the holders' claims under the Notes directly. The Parallel Debt Obligation is in the same amount and payable
at the same time as the obligations of the creditors under the Notes and the Guarantees (the "Principal
**Obligations"), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding**
Parallel Debt Obligation and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt Obligation will discharge the
corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt,
a claim against the holders and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, the legal concept
of creating parallel debt obligations has not yet been tested before a German court and there is no certainty
that German courts will uphold such pledges. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that such concept will not
be recognised by German courts or that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of invalidity and
unenforceability of pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be
restricted.

Moreover, the Security Agent holds the pledges in trust. This means that in the case of an insolvency of the
Security Agent, the insolvency administrator over the insolvency estate of the Security Agent may
successfully claim that there is no right for separation (Aussonderungsrecht) of the holders with respect to
the secured claims. As a consequence, the secured claims (including the parallel debt) and the accessory
security rights would remain with the (then insolvent) Security Agent.


-----

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement
of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset
constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting
periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the
collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such
security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral.

Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to
their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral
and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by
other creditors). Under German mandatory law, the value of collateral transferred or assigned for security
purposes must not be excessive. Due to German mandatory law, security grantors may have a right to claim
the release of certain collateral in case of a subsequent over-collateralization (where the value of security
interest granted significantly and not only temporarily exceeds the amount of the secured obligations), or
security interest can even be deemed void in case of an initial excessive overcollateralization. A security
transfer or assignment violating this rule either in itself or in combination with other security interests will
be deemed void if the violation exists at the time the collateral is granted. If the ratio is exceeded later as a
result of partial prepayment or of progressing repayment of the secured obligations, the security grantor is
entitled to a corresponding ratable release of the collateral. There is no clear authority as to how the ratio
has to be applied in the context of a financing involving several companies and to what extent accessory
forms of collateral (e.g., share pledges) granted for the same obligations have to be taken into account.
While the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) does the calculation on a case-by-case basis,
legal authors estimate that an initial over-collateralization is given if the realization value of the security
exceeds the aggregate amount of secured claims.

**England and Wales**

Certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of England and Wales (each an "English **Guarantor").**

The English Guarantors are companies incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Therefore, as a
matter of English insolvency law, insolvency proceedings by or against an English Guarantor could be
commenced in England and would be governed by English insolvency laws.

Furthermore, even though the Issuer is organized under the laws of Luxembourg, it is possible that it could
be subject to English insolvency proceedings. Although the scope of the English courts' jurisdiction varies
for the different insolvency proceedings available in England and Wales, English courts generally have
jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any company that (a) is incorporated in the United
Kingdom; (b) is incorporated in a European Economic Area ("EEA") State; or (c) is not incorporated in an
EEA State but has its "centre of main interests" in a member state (other than Denmark). While this allows
English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency
proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of
subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions.

English insolvency law is different from and may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of other
jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that the Issuer or a Guarantor experiences
financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar
proceedings.

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways,
including (a) by the company or a creditor making an application to court for administration; (b) by the
company or certain types of secured creditor filing documents with the court for administration; (c) by a
creditor filing a petition to wind up the company; or (d) by the shareholders of the company resolving to
put the company into liquidation. A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be
placed into administration if it is, or is likely, to become unable to pay its debts, and the administration is
reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes.

Under the Insolvency Act 1986 (the "UK Insolvency Act"), a company is insolvent if it is unable to pay its
debts. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a "cash flow" basis (unable to pay its debts
as they fall due), if it is insolvent on a "balance sheet" basis (the value of the company's assets is less than
the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), if it fails to satisfy


-----

a creditor's statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 or if it fails to satisfy in full a judgment debt (or
similar court order).

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain
limitations on the Note Guarantees given by the English Guarantor (or any other Guarantor who may be
subject to the jurisdiction of the English court in respect of the opening of insolvency proceedings in
England and Wales) and the security interests granted in respect of the Notes. The application of these laws
could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the applicable Guarantees and/or
security securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts that investors
may receive in an insolvency of the English Guarantor (or any other Guarantor who may be subject to the
jurisdiction of the English court in respect of the opening of insolvency proceedings in England and Wales).

_Fixed and Floating Charges_

Fixed charge security has a number of advantages over floating charge security, save as provided under the
Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (the "Financial Collateral Arrangements
**Regulations"): (a) an administrator appointed to the company which granted the floating charge can**
dispose of floating charge assets for cash or collect receivables charged by way of floating charge and use
the proceeds and/or cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which can include
the costs of continuing to operate the charging company's business while in administration) in priority to
the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed charge over assets, even if created after the date of a
floating charge over the same assets, will rank prior to the floating charge over some charged assets;
(c) general costs and expenses (including the officeholder's remuneration) properly incurred in a windingup or administration are payable out of floating charge assets to the extent the assets of the company
available for creditors generally are otherwise insufficient to meet them (subject to certain restrictions for
the costs of litigation) in priority to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating charge security crystallizes,
a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course
of its business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to
give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge; (e) floating charge security is subject
to certain challenges under English insolvency law (for further information, see "—Avoidance of Floating
_Charge"); and (f) floating charge security is subject to the claims of preferential creditors (such as_
occupational pension scheme contributions, salaries owed to employees (subject to a cap per employee)
and holiday pay owed to employees) and collected taxes such as VAT and, where the floating charge is not
a security financial collateral arrangement, to the claims of unsecured creditors in respect of a ring-fenced
amount of the proceeds (for further information, see "—Administration and Floating Charges").

Under English insolvency law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterize as floating charges any
security interests expressed to be created by a security document as fixed charges where the chargee does
not have the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor's ability to deal with the relevant assets
and the proceeds thereof or does not exercise such control in practice as the description given to the charges
in the relevant security document as fixed charges is not determinative. Where the chargor is free to deal
with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee, the court is likely to hold that the security interest
in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

_Administration and Floating Charges_

The UK Insolvency Act enables an administrator to be appointed (either by filing documents with the court
or following an application to court) in respect of any company (i) incorporated in England, Wales, Scotland
or an EEA state; or (ii) (irrespective of its country of incorporation) with its "centre of main interests" in
the United Kingdom or an EU member state (other than Denmark). In each case and subject to specific
conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or
is likely to become "unable to pay its debts" and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve
the purpose of administration. An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its
directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge that has become enforceable, and different procedures
apply according to the identity of the appointer.

The purpose of an administration is composed of three parts that must be looked at successively: rescuing
the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the
company's creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were to enter into liquidation without
first being in administration or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of
the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to


-----

secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set
out below (see "—Priority of Claims on Insolvency" below).

An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are appointed
and, subject to certain requirements under the UK Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in
administration (including property subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the
realization of any property subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside for satisfaction of the claims
of preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the prescribed part (see "—Prescribed Part" below). An
administrator may also, with prior approval by the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided
_that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator_
applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed
charge holder.

During the administration, in general no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or
continued against the debtor or its assets, or security or guarantee enforced over the company's property,
except with leave of the court or the consent of the administrator (statutory moratorium). Certain creditors
of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over that company's property
notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in
relation to security interests created or arising under a "financial collateral agreement" (generally,
security/collateral in respect of cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital
market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements Regulations. If the Issuer or a
Guarantor were to enter administration, it is likely that any security or guarantee granted by it may not be
enforced while it is in administration, without the leave of court or consent of the administrator. In addition,
other than in limited circumstances, no administrative receiver can be appointed by a secured creditor in
preference to an administrator, and any already appointed must resign if requested to do so by the
administrator. Where the company is already in administration no other receiver may be appointed.

In order for a security agent to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company, it
must hold a floating charge granted by an English company that must constitute a "qualifying floating
charge" for purposes of the UK Insolvency Act and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative
receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document predates September 15, 2003,
fall within one of the exceptions in the UK Insolvency Act to the prohibition on the appointment of
administrative receivers. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be
created by an instrument that (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to
empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to
appoint an administrative receiver. A security agent will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if
such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with any other security interests granted to that party,
relates to the whole, or substantially the whole, of the property of the relevant English company, and at
least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that it is a matter of fact whether
the extent of the security granted relates to "the whole or substantially the whole" of the property of a
company and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company's assets should be charged
to satisfy this test. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative
receiver is the exception relating to "capital market arrangements" (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act),
which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50 million during the life of the
arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a "capital markets investment" (which is defined in
the UK Insolvency Act, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and
not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court
procedure) and only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers
that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge,
including as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator
is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office.

_Fixed Charge Receivership_

A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain floating
charges) may be appointed over some or all of the assets secured by a fixed charge in accordance with the
terms of a security document creating a fixed charge or (in limited circumstances) pursuant to statute under
the Law of Property Act 1925 (the "Law of Property Act"), although it is standard market practice to
augment the powers of any receiver appointed through the relevant security document.


-----

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge
(such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for
an appointment to take place. A receivership is not a process pursuant to English insolvency laws as such
and a fixed charge receivership can be run in parallel to a liquidation or an administration. However, an
administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was
appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a "financial collateral arrangement."

The primary duty of a fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning
(s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor, although certain limited duties are also owed to the
chargor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a
company's creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration
is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to
obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled
to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company
(and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor).

_Scheme of Arrangement_

Although not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 (the "Companies
**Act") the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise**
of a company's liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors). The English
Guarantor may be able to propose a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities as would any other
Guarantor _provided that there is "sufficient connection" with the United Kingdom (which can include_
English law documents).

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the
proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes,
depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights
that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its
creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting
at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms
and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction
of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate
in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court
at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is
reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order
conditional upon modifications being made or refuse to sanction the scheme. In exercising its discretion to
sanction a scheme of a foreign obligor, the court will need to be satisfied that the scheme of arrangement
would have substantial effect in the jurisdictions in which the company has its main assets or operations,
in the jurisdictions of any other obligors of the debt and under the governing law the affected debt
documents (if not English law). This is typically achieved by providing expert evidence that the scheme of
arrangement (or its effect) is likely to be recognized in such jurisdictions. Once sanctioned, the scheme of
arrangement binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the scheme of arrangement,
which shall be effective (in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court's order sanctioning the
scheme of arrangement to the Registrar of Companies.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not
automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings. See also below in relation to the restructuring
plan.

_Liquidation/Winding-up_

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of the company are realized and
distributed by the liquidator to creditors (and, if applicable, shareholders) in the statutory order of priority
prescribed by the UK Insolvency Act. Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company is dissolved
and removed from the register of companies.

There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) members'
voluntary liquidation or creditors' voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company's
members. The difference between the two voluntary proceedings is the solvency of the company in
question; in a members' voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as


-----

to the company's solvency over the following twelve months whereas the primary ground for the creditors'
voluntary liquidation of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123
of the UK Insolvency Act). Note that while a creditors' voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from
administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is
subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors' voluntary
liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies, the tests for establishing jurisdiction are slightly
different. For a compulsory liquidation, all that is required is that there is "sufficient connection" with the
relevant UK jurisdiction. This can involve assets or creditors in the United Kingdom or English law
governed agreements. For a voluntary liquidation, either the "centre of main interests" must be in the United
Kingdom or the "centre of main interests" must be in the European Union with an establishment (very
broadly, a branch office) in the United Kingdom.

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary windingup. In a compulsory winding up, under Section 127 of the UK Insolvency Act any disposition of the relevant
company's property made after the commencement of the winding up is, unless sanctioned by the court,
void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or
otherwise arising under a "financial collateral arrangement" under the Financial Collateral Arrangements
Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms.
Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is
deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding up petition. Once a winding up
order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No action or
proceeding may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court and
subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security.

In the context of a voluntary winding up, however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a
winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there
is no equivalent of Section 127 of the UK Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a
voluntary winding-up — it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for
a stay to prevent the continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of security.

A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the
business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company's property
(provided that in respect of the sale of any property that is secured by a fixed charge in favor of a creditor,
if that sale is made without the secured creditor's consent, it will be made subject to that security, as the
creditor's consent will be needed to release the security) and execute documents in the name of the company
and to challenge antecedent transactions. At the end of the liquidation process the company will be
dissolved.

Under the UK Insolvency Act, with some exceptions, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous
property, which is any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold,
readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may
be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the
company that may be detrimental to creditors. However, this power does not apply to a contract where all
the obligations under which have been performed, nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities
of any other person. If a contract is disclaimed, the contractual counterparty has a right to sue for damages
in respect of the terminated contract. In addition, the power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to
any financial collateral arrangement.

_Company Voluntary Arrangements_

Pursuant to Part I of the UK Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator
as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement ("CVA") to the company's shareholders and
creditors which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors,
typically a rescheduling or reducing of the company's unsecured debts. Though it does not result in the
insolvency of a company, a CVA is implemented under the supervision of an insolvency practitioner who
will act as the nominee before the CVA proposals are approved, and as the supervisor afterwards. Provided
_that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure, it will_
bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote in the decision procedure or who would have been
entitled to vote if they had had notice of the decision procedure. A company voluntary arrangement cannot
affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent. Shareholders of the


-----

company will also be asked to vote on the CVA but whether or not they vote in favor, the CVA will be
implemented if the requisite majority of creditors approve the proposal.

_Priority of Claims on Insolvency_

One of the primary functions of liquidation (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern,
one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the insolvent
company and to distribute the proceeds from those assets to its creditors. Under English insolvency law,
creditors are placed into different classes and, with the exceptions and adjustments noted below, the
proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company's property are applied in descending order of
priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions
generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class
have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on
a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a
class.

After a company goes into liquidation (and following notice that an administrator intends to make a
distribution to creditors), contractual set-off arrangements are only respected to the extent they fall within
the definition of "mutual dealing" as applied by the mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime sees
an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and
only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the
company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company
(if amounts remain due to the company). Certain amounts are excluded from the account (such as any post
liquidation or post administration interest), and there are certain mandatory rules for the conversion of
foreign currency claims. The granting of security (amongst other things) over the relevant claims will
destroy mutuality for these purposes.

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

- _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent the value of the secured assets_
covers that indebtedness) and creditors with a proprietary interest in the debtor's assets but only
with respect to the assets in which they have a proprietary interest;

- _Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order_
of priority in which expenses are paid);

- _Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors._

Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company
in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries
of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of
£800 per person; and (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated,
whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (iv) bank and
building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme
(the "FSCS") up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank
equally;

Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential debts
and include (but are not limited to) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the
FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit, claims by HM Revenue and Customs in
respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax, employee NI contributions, student
loan repayments and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and
employer NI contributions which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers).
As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally;

- _Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This_
would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created
it but which, on a proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating charge. However,
before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (defined
below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors;


-----

- _Fifth ranking: firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors (save where such creditors are deferred_
under Section 74(2)(f) of the UK Insolvency Act) and any secured creditor to the extent of any
unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the
date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. These debts rank equally among
themselves unless there are subordination agreements in place between any of them. To pay the
secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations
from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed
Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors or the secured creditor
elects to surrender its security;

_secondly, interest on the company's unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable_
contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8%
per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the
commencement of any administration which had been converted into a distributing administration.
However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Note Guarantees,
such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the
secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries;

_thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above_
and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid; and

- _Sixth ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining_
funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the
subordination language in the relevant documentation.

_Onset of Insolvency_

The date of the Onset of Insolvency (as discussed below), for the purposes of, among others, transactions
at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges (as discussed below) depends on the insolvency
procedure in question.

In an administration, the Onset of Insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an
administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c)
otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation,
the Onset of Insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary
liquidation it is the date the company passes the relevant winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows
administration, the Onset of Insolvency will be the same as for the initial administration.

_Challenges to Guarantees and Security_

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting of security and guarantees by
any company that could be subject to English insolvency proceedings can be challenged. In most cases this
will only arise if an administrator or liquidator is appointed to the company within a specified period (as
set out in more detail below) of the granting of the guarantee or security. Therefore, if during the specified
period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to the Issuer or any Guarantor, the administrator or
liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by such company.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to charges and guarantees:

_Transactions at an Undervalue_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set aside
the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation
of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. It will only be a transaction
at an undervalue if at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the English company is or
becomes insolvent (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the company
grants the security interest or the guarantee within a period of two years prior to the Onset of Insolvency.
A transaction might be subject to being set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a
gift to a person, if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of
significantly less value, in money or money's worth, than the consideration given by such company. A


-----

court, however, generally will not intervene if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction
in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were
reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction
was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to
what it would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the
administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the
transaction was a connected person (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act), in which case there is a
presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the company in such
proceedings. An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose
any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the
transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person
other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest,
and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay
a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was a party to the
transaction.

_Preference_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set aside
the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) if such liquidator or administrator
believed that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. It will only
be a preference if at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction the company is unable to pay
its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the UK Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the
company grants the security interest or the guarantee within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of
the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected
person) prior to the Onset of Insolvency. A transaction may constitute a preference if it has the effect of
putting a creditor of the company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company's debts or liabilities) in
a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor
or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If the court determines
that the transaction was a preference, the court has very wide powers for restoring the position to what it
would have been if that preference had not been given, which could include reducing payments under the
Notes and the Note Guarantees (although there is protection for a third-party who enters into a transaction
in good faith and without notice). For the court to determine a preference, however, it must be shown that
the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the
administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was insolvent and that the company was
influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a
connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the
company's employee), in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to
produce the preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there
was no such influence. An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any
obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person to whom the preference was given, but such
an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the
company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not
require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the
liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference
given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the company.

_Transactions Defrauding Creditors_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or an administrator of a company, or a person who is a "victim"
of the relevant transaction can apply to the court pursuant to Section 423 of the Insolvency Act for an order
to set aside a security interest or guarantee granted by that company on the grounds that the security interest
or guarantee was a transaction defrauding creditors.

A transaction will constitute a transaction defrauding creditors if it is a transaction at an undervalue and the
court is satisfied that the substantial purpose of a party to the transaction was to put assets beyond the reach
of creditors with actual or potential claims against it, or to prejudice the interest of such persons.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, then it may make such
order as it may deem fit to restore the position to what it was prior to the transaction or to protect the victims
of the transaction (including reducing payments under the guarantee or setting aside the security interest or


-----

guarantees), though there is protection for a third-party acting in good faith and for value without notice of
the relevant circumstances. Any "victim" of the transaction (with the permission of the court if the company
is in liquidation or administration) may apply to the court under this provision, not merely liquidators or
administrators.

There is no time limit in English insolvency legislation within which the company must enter insolvency
proceedings, and the relevant company does not need to have been unable to pay its debts at the time of the
transaction. The fact that the transaction was not entered into with a dishonest motive is no defense to the
claim. It will suffice that the company's subjective purpose was to place the assets out of the reach of
creditors or a particular creditor. There is no need to show that the intention was the sole purpose and a
substantial purpose is likely to suffice.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such
orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been
entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect
the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the
transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was
acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the
relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good
faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a
party to the transaction.

_Avoidance of Floating Charge_

Under English insolvency law, if a company in administration or liquidation grants a floating charge within
a period of twelve months prior to the Onset of Insolvency (or two years if the parties are connected), then
such floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services
supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English company at the same time as
or after the creation of the floating charge. If the floating charge is granted to an unconnected person, it can
only be challenged if the grantor was insolvent (for the purposes of Section 123 of the UK Insolvency Act)
at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge but this requirement does not apply where the
floating charge is granted to a connected person.

An administrator, or a liquidator (as applicable), does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that
a floating charge is invalid. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically
invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any
discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English company at the same time as or after the creation
of the floating charge (plus certain interest).

_Dispositions in Winding-up_

Under Section 127 of the UK Insolvency Act, any dispositions of a company's property made after a
winding-up has commenced is, unless the court orders otherwise, void. However, this will not apply to any
property or security interest subject to a disposition or otherwise arising under a financial collateral
arrangement under the Financial Collateral Arrangements Regulations and will not prevent a close-out
netting provision from taking effect in accordance with its terms. The compulsory winding-up of a company
is deemed to start when a winding-up petition is presented by a creditor against the company, rather than
the date that the court makes the winding-up order (if any).

_Extortionate Credit Transactions_

An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A credit
transaction is "extortionate" if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the
terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally
or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened
ordinary principles of fair dealing.

It is presumed, unless otherwise proved by the person extending the credit, that a transaction with respect
to which an administrator or liquidator makes an application to set aside an extortionate credit transaction
is extortionate. The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by a
company up to three years before the day on which a company entered administration or liquidation. That


-----

order may set aside, either in whole or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include
obligations of sureties). It may also vary the terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the
purposes of the transaction, the court may require any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or
administrator sums already paid under the transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held
for the purpose of the transaction. It should be noted that there are no provisions for the protection of third
parties who acquire interests in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g., assignees of the benefit of the
transaction from the person who provided credit under it).

_Connected Persons_

"Connected person" is defined by the UK Insolvency Act. The fact that the parties are connected can have
various consequences. For example, in the case of a preference, the "look back" period (in which the
transaction must have occurred prior to the Onset of Insolvency) is increased from six months to two years
and, in the case of a floating charge for no new value, the "look back" period is increased from twelve
months to two years. Furthermore, certain statutory presumptions arise where the parties are connected (so
for example the debtor is presumed to have been influenced by a desire to prefer the counterparty where
the parties are connected). Finally and most significantly, the solvency defense is not available in respect
of the challenge of a floating charge for no new value where the parties are connected. However, if the
floating charge qualifies as a "security financial collateral agreement" under the Financial Collateral
Arrangements, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph.

If a given transaction at an undervalue, preference or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the
company with a "connected person," then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to
any challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out above). A "connected person" of a company
granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences or
invalid floating charges, is a party who is: (a) a director of the company; (b) a shadow director; (c) an
associate of such director or shadow directors; or (d) an associate of the relevant company.

A party is associated with an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual's
husband, wife or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual's husband, wife or civil partner; (d) the
husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual; or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of a
relative of the individual's husband, wife or civil partner. A person is an associate of any person with whom
he is in partnership and of the husband, wife or civil partner or relative of any individual with whom he is
in partnership. A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company (and in this
case, directors of a company are treated as employees of that company). A person is also an associate of
any person whom he employs. A company is associated with another company if the same person has
control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and
persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control
of each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of
the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of
whom he is an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another
company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions
or instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power
at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more
persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company.

The most common way of parties to become connected in the context of commercial transactions is by way
of share security (where the lender may have control over the voting rights in respect of the shares upon a
default) or by having common directors.

_Security over Shares_

Security (other than by way of a legal mortgage) over shares granted by a company, under English law, are
equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a charging company creates an
encumbrance over the property in favor of the chargee but the charging company retains legal title to the
shares. Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or may
otherwise be at the discretion of the court.


-----

The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security interests over shares may
additionally be affected by a failure of the charging company or related parties or (in certain circumstances)
the secured parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the disclosure and notification obligations
under English company statutes in respect of persons with significant control.

_Security over Bank Accounts_

With respect to any security over bank accounts (each a "Bank Account Charge"), the banks with which
some of those accounts are held (each an "Account Bank") may hold a right at any time (at least prior to
them being notified of a crystallisation event under the Bank Account Charge) to exercise the rights of
netting or set off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other arrangements with the grantor
of that security. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a floating (rather than
fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account
Bank's rights to exercise netting and set off with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant
Bank Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallised and converted into a fixed charge and the
Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant
Account Bank's netting and set off rights.

_Limitation on Enforcement_

Under English law, the grant of a Guarantee or other form of security by a company in respect of the
obligations of another Group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a
transaction must be allowed by the company's memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that
the above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee or other security can
be found to be void and the respective creditor's rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for
third-parties if they are dealing with the company in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not
without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for the company by
virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act provides that a director
must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the
company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is
no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a
transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court.

Section 172(3) of the Companies Act additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need
to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not
prescribe when this shift arises, the English courts have held that it takes place when the directors know, or
should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with "likely" in this context
meaning "probable."

Security and/or guarantees granted by a company may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent
they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law.

_Security Registration_

Under English company law, subject to limited exceptions, a certified copy of any security document
pursuant to which a charging company incorporated in England and Wales grants security (including
security governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant
security) may be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of
creation of the relevant security interest (the "Registration Period"). While the Companies Act does not
impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security, security will be deemed to be void
against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered
within the Registration Period. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured
by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to
apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be
registered after the Registration Period has expired.

The Financial Collateral Arrangements Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from
registration with the Registrar of Companies. Security created by overseas companies over assets in
England and Wales similarly does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies, although
registration with applicable asset registries may still be required depending on the nature of the collateral
assets.


-----

_Corporate Authorizations and Maintenance of Capital_

The legality, validity and enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer and any Guarantor under the Notes,
the Note Guarantees and any future security taken over the Notes are subject to matters affecting companies
generally, including that: (i) its entry into and performance of such obligations: (a) are not prohibited by its
constitutional documents (or contracts to which it is party); and (b) have been duly authorized and do not
breach or result in inconsistency with applicable laws or regulations; and (c) the documents evidencing
such obligations have been duly executed and delivered in accordance with all applicable procedures and
laws. In addition, the granting of upstream (or cross-stream) guarantees or security by a company could be
subject to challenge if it results in a reduction in that company's net assets as properly recorded in its books
or, to the extent that it does, the company does not have sufficient distributable reserves to cover that
reduction.

_Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020_

On June 26, 2020, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (the "CIGA") enacted fundamental
reforms to the United Kingdom's existing insolvency and companies legislation. There is limited guidance
on how the legislation will be interpreted (given the insufficient jurisprudence since it came into force) and
the Secretary of State may by regulations modify the exceptions. It is therefore possible that aspects of the
legislation may change.

_Moratorium_

The CIGA introduced a standalone moratorium to enable certain eligible companies to prevent creditors
taking certain actions against the company for a specified period in order to to seek rescue options and
reach an agreement with their creditors to facilitate a restructuring.

Subject to certain exclusions and meeting requisite conditions, any company that is liable to be wound up
under the UK Insolvency Act is eligible for a moratorium. Ineligible companies include certain financial
services companies (including insurance and securitization companies as well as parties to capital market
arrangements). Directors of any eligible non-overseas company may commence a moratorium by filing the
requisite papers at court (known as the out-of-court-process). Companies subject to an outstanding winding
up petition must apply to court for an order granting the moratorium, which will only be granted if the court
is satisfied that the moratorium will result in a better result for the company's creditors as a whole than
winding up without one (known as the in-court process). In addition, overseas companies must always use
the in-court process.

Both in- and out-of-court processes involve a statement from the directors of the company that, in their
view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. Furthermore, a monitor, who is an
insolvency practitioner appointed to oversee the moratorium, must separately confirm (among other things)
that the moratorium would likely result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. This is an ongoing
requirement in order for a moratorium to continue; indeed, a monitor must terminate the moratorium if, at
any time, it becomes apparent that the company is unlikely to be rescued as a going concern and/ or keep
up with its required payments.

During a moratorium, creditors are restricted from taking enforcement measures against the company,
including commencing insolvency and other legal proceedings and enforcing security without the leave of
the monitor or the court. The CIGA includes a carve-out for enforcement of security financial collateral (or
the taking of any step to enforce a collateral security charge), which are permitted. In contrast to a
moratorium arising from an administration, a floating charge may not be crystallized during this new
moratorium, nor may any restrictions on the disposal of a floating charge asset be imposed.

A company subject to a moratorium has the benefit of a payment holiday in relation to certain debts incurred
prior to the commencement of the moratorium. However, certain other debts, including those which arise
under a contract or other instrument involving financial services (which would include capital market
arrangements) entered into or incurred prior to the moratorium, are exempted from payment holidays and
such liabilities are therefore required to be met as and when they fall due. In addition, the company must
continue to pay "moratorium debts" (i.e., debts and liabilities to which the company becomes subject during
or after the moratorium by reason of an obligation incurred during the moratorium). Failure to pay such
liabilities, plus any debt incurred during the moratorium, which arise or become payable during the
moratorium will compel the monitor to end the moratorium.


-----

Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in the same way as expenses in an administration. Where
a company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters into administration or liquidation within a twelveweek period, any unpaid moratorium debts and any pre-moratorium debts for which the company did not
have a payment holiday (excluding financial debt accelerated during the moratorium), as well as any
prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company, will
have super-priority over any costs or claims in the administration or liquidation (except for claims of fixed
charge creditors to the extent such creditors can be paid out of the assets charged).

A moratorium will last for an initial period of 20 business days, which may be extended for a further 20
business days by the directors of the company. Where an extension is proposed, statements from the
directors and the monitor must be filed with the court confirming that the qualifying conditions continue to
be met. Further extensions (beyond 40 business days) will be available:

- pursuant to an out-of-court filing for a period of up to one year from commencement, if more than
50% (by value) of secured and more than 50% (by value) of unsecured creditors vote in favor of
the extension, unless in both cases, more than 50% (by number) of unconnected secured and
unsecured creditors vote against the extension. Only creditors with pre-moratorium debt in respect
of which the company has a payment holiday, which has fallen due or may fall due before the
proposed revised end date of the moratorium, will have the right to vote;

- pursuant to an application by the directors to court for such period as the court sees fit;

- in connection with a company voluntary arrangement until the proposal is implemented, accepted
or rejected by creditors or withdrawn by the company or the moratorium otherwise comes to an
end; and

- at the court's discretion in connection with a scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan.

_Restructuring Plan_

The CIGA inserted Part 26A in the Companies Act, which provides for a court-supervised compromise
procedure (the restructuring plan procedure) that is intended broadly to follow the process for a scheme of
arrangement. Like a scheme of arrangement, a restructuring plan is a procedure which allows the English
courts to effect a compromise of a company's liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class
of its creditors), but with the added possibility of a "cross-class cram-down" imposing the restructuring on
creditors and/or shareholders without their consent, subject to certain conditions being met and the court
being convinced to exercise its discretionary power to sanction the restructuring plan. While generally
available to the same domestic and foreign companies as schemes of arrangement, a company seeking to
enter into a restructuring plan process must show that (a) it has encountered, or is likely to encounter,
financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going
concern, and (b) a compromise or arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors
(or any class of them) the purpose of which is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of any
of those financial difficulties.

A restructuring plan may be proposed by the debtor company, any creditor of the company or any liquidator
or administrator appointed to the company. As with a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote
on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of
classes depending on the rights of such creditors which will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan
and any new rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring plan.

A restructuring plan will be deemed to be approved if at least 75% in value of the creditors present and
voting at the meeting of at least one class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed compromise. There is
no requirement for the approving creditors to constitute a majority in number of those creditors present and
voting, and there is crucially no requirement for each and every voting class to approve of the plan, provided
_that the court is satisfied that (a) none of the members of a dissenting class would be any worse off if the_
restructuring plan were to be sanctioned than they would be in the event of the "relevant alternative" and
(b) the restructuring plan was approved by at least one class of creditors who would receive a payment or
have a genuine economic interest in the company in the event of the "relevant alternative." The "relevant
alternative" for the purposes of this assessment is whatever the court considers would be most likely to
occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned. By virtue of these mechanics,
the restructuring plan process provides for the possibility of a "cross-class cram-down," meaning the courts


-----

may sanction a restructuring plan even if one or more classes of affected creditors do not vote in favor of
the restructuring plan, effectively allowing the vote of one class of stakeholders to bind other classes.

Following approval of the restructuring plan at the creditor meeting(s), the restructuring plan needs to be
sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether the applicable statutory
conditions have been met and may also consider whether the restructuring plan is just and equitable. The
court has discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional
upon modifications being made or refuse to sanction the restructuring plan. Once sanctioned, the
restructuring plan binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the restructuring plan,
which shall be effective (in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court's order sanctioning the
restructuring plan to the Registrar of Companies.

As with schemes of arrangement, the commencement of a restructuring plan process does not automatically
trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings.

_Restrictions on the Operation and Exercise of Ipso Facto Provisions_

The CIGA introduced a restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto clauses in order to preserve
the continuity of the provision of goods and services to companies undergoing insolvency procedures. In
general terms, ipso facto clauses are provisions in supply of goods or services contracts which allow
suppliers to terminate the contract or supply or take any other action, or provide for the automatic
termination of the contract or supply or the occurrence of any other event, upon the counterparty entering
an insolvency procedure. Pursuant to the CIGA reforms, to the extent that the trigger event is the
counterparty's entry into a "relevant insolvency procedure" (i.e., an administration, administrative
receivership, company voluntary arrangement, liquidation and/or a restructuring plan), such clauses will be
deemed void and suppliers will be unable to terminate the relevant contracts unless (subject to exemptions)
the company or the relevant office-holder consents to the termination or the court grants permission on the
basis that it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship.

The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving financial services or entities involved in the
provision of financial services, including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or
guarantees, contracts for the purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and agreements which are,
or form part of, arrangements involving the issue of a capital market investment (as defined in the UK
Insolvency Act).

_Cross-Border Recognition of English Insolvency and Restructuring Proceedings_

The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed by
applicable treaties in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts' jurisdiction, proceedings
and judgments and general principles of private international law such as comity and conflicts of laws rules
applicable in the relevant jurisdictions.

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the
"Model Law"), which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and Great
Britain, where it was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the
"Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations"). The Model Law provides for recognition of certain British
insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if the "centre of main
interests" of the relevant debtor is determined to be in Great Britain) or foreign non-main proceedings (if
the "centre of main interests" is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment
in Great Britain) upon application by the relevant insolvency officeholder. The nature and scope of the
recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the
jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations provide for recognition in
the United Kingdom of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main proceedings (if the proceedings are
taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its "centre of main interests") or non-main proceedings
(if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment). If
foreign insolvency proceedings are recognized under the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations, there will
be a moratorium that is equivalent to the stay that arises in an English liquidation (i.e., a stay on the
commencement or continuation of proceedings but not the enforcement of security). The foreign
representative of the debtor can apply for wider relief (such as a stay on the enforcement of security) but
this is at the discretion of the English court. The English court has held that only procedural relief (such as


-----

stays) are available under the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations; the English court cannot recognize or
give effect to a foreign insolvency judgment under these regulations.

The recognition of English courts' jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are
restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the
jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague
Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the "Hague Convention") and the Lugano Convention
2007 (the "Lugano Convention") (subject to the United Kingdom's pending application to accede to the
latter) where these apply. In addition, recognition may still be available under principles of private
international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations ("Rome I").

The Lugano Convention and the Hague Convention both contain exclusions whereby they are deemed not
to apply to judgments handed down in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. As the law currently stands,
the English Court considers that restructuring plans fall within this exclusion due to the requirement that a
company must have encountered or be likely to encounter financial difficulties in order to propose a
restructuring plan. Unlike schemes of arrangement, restructuring plans therefore fall outside the scope of
the Lugano Convention and the Hague Convention. The recognition of a restructuring plan in member states
therefore depends upon Rome I and/or the domestic laws of those member states, and may be less
straightforward than the recognition of a scheme of arrangement.

_Assignments_

Any assignment of a debt or other chose in action, including by way of security, can only take effect as a
legal assignment under Section 136 of the Law of Property Act if it meets the requirements of that provision,
which are: (i) the assignment must be in writing; (ii) the assignment must be absolute and not purporting to
be by way of charge only; and (iii) notice of the assignment must be given to the underlying obligor. If any
of these requirements are not satisfied, the assignment may still constitute a valid equitable assignment.
Equitable assignments, including by way of security, are subject to certain limitations, including but not
limited to: (i) where an equitable interest is followed by a legal interest, the subsequent legal interest will
take priority if the holder acquired it for value without notice of the equitable interest; and (ii) the priority
of dealings in most equitable interests is determined by the time at which notice of such interest is given to
the underlying obligor or to the person in control of that equitable interest. The first to give notice will take
priority, if that person does not have actual or constructive notice of the prior interest and has given
consideration for his or her interest.

_Share Mortgages_

A mortgage of shares can only take effect as a legal mortgage if the relevant transfers of shares are
registered, although it may still give rise to a valid equitable security interest.

_Person with Significant Control Regime_

Pursuant to Part 21A of the Companies Act (and related Schedules 1A and 1B to the Companies Act), from
April 6, 2016 certain UK incorporated companies, societates europaeae and limited liability partnerships
(for the purposes of this paragraph, each a relevant company) must keep a register of certain registrable
individuals and legal entities that have significant control over them. Failure of such registrable individuals
or legal entities or other persons specified in Part 21A of (and Schedule 1B to) the Companies Act (for the
purposes of this paragraph, each a notifying party) to comply with the requirements of that Part may give
relevant companies the right to issue a restrictions notice to such notifying party for the purposes of
Schedule 1B to the Companies Act. Subject to certain exceptions, the effect of a restrictions notice is that
in respect of any relevant interest in the relevant company (as defined in Schedule 1B to the Companies
Act, for example, a share in the relevant company): (a) any transfer of (or agreement to transfer) the interest
is void; (b) no rights are exercisable in respect of the interest; (c) no shares may be issued in right of the
interest or in pursuance of an offer made to the interest-holder; and (d) except in a liquidation, no payment
may be made of sums due from the relevant company in respect of the interest, whether in respect of capital
or otherwise. Such restrictions could adversely affect the validity of any future security interests over the
security and the ability of a security agent to enforce its rights under English security documents.


-----

_National Security and Investment Act 2021_

The National Security and Investment Act 2021 (the "NSIA") came into force in January 2022 as the United
Kingdom's new national security screening regime. The NSIA gives the UK Government powers to
scrutinize and intervene in transactions where control over certain entities or assets has been or will be
"acquired" and this may give rise to a national security risk in the United Kingdom. The powers are broad
and could affect lenders and security agents when taking and enforcing security over shares or assets,
particularly in the 17 designated sensitive sectors.

_Application of Proceeds_

The enforceability of a provision in a security document that relates to the application of proceeds will be
subject to any obligations mandatorily preferred by applicable law.

_Ranking_

The description given by the parties to the ranking of security interests is not determinative of the ranking
of those security interests.

_Prescribed Part_

An insolvency practitioner of the company (e.g., administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator) will
generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge
security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and
expenses out of floating charge realizations) (the "Prescribed Part"). Under current law, this ring-fence
applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of net floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over
£10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company's net property is available
to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case
the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured
creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors.

The requirement for an insolvency practitioner to set aside a Prescribed Part of the company's property
which is subject to a floating charge, and make it available for unsecured creditors, will not apply to any
charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement (as described in the Financial
Collateral Arrangements Regulations).

_Foreign Currency of Debt_

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts,
any debt of a company payable in a currency other than British pounds sterling must be converted into
British pounds sterling at the "official exchange rate" prevailing at the date when the debtor went into
liquidation or administration. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. If a creditor
considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court. The "official exchange rate" for these
purposes is the middle exchange rate on the London Foreign Exchange Market at close of business as
published for the date in question or, if no such rate is published, such rate as the court determines.
Accordingly, in the event that the English Guarantor (or any other Guarantor who may be subject to the
jurisdiction of the English court in respect of the opening of insolvency proceedings in England and Wales)
goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between
the date that the Issuer or such Guarantor (as the case may be) went into liquidation or administration and
receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Notes may become entitled. Any losses resulting from
currency fluctuations are not recoverable from the insolvent estate.

_Foreign Laws_

If, and to the extent that, an asset subject to security under a security document (or the obligor of any debt
or other right against any person, which debt or right constitutes all or part of the property or rights subject
to that security) is located in any jurisdiction other than England and Wales or is not governed by English
law, the validity and priority of that security may be affected by any applicable foreign laws.


-----

_Third Party Rights_

Security granted over debts from, or other rights against, third parties (including contracts and insurance
policies) may be subject to any rights of those third parties.

_Amendments_

An English court may interpret restrictively any provision purporting to allow the beneficiary of a guarantee
or other suretyship to make a material amendment to the obligations to which the guarantee or suretyship
relates without further reference to the guarantor or surety.

**Italy**

**_Insolvency_**

The following is a brief description of certain main aspects of the insolvency laws of Italy, focusing in
particular on the rules governing the main insolvency and restructuring proceedings, which however does
not include an overview of the special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies
authorized to carry out certain reserved activities nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency
laws application where public entities (including sovereign-owned companies) or natural persons are
involved. In any event, the below summary is not intended to be an exhaustive and comprehensive review
and outlook of the Insolvency regime and tools currently in force under Italian law. In addition, certain
provisions of Italian insolvency and restructuring law have been amended or have entered into force only
recently and, therefore, may be subject to further implementation and/or interpretations and have not been
tested to date in the Italian courts. The most recent and comprehensive reform of the Italian insolvency and
restructuring regime has been approved by the Italian government on January 12, 2019, by enacting the
Legislative Decree No. 14/2019 "Codice della crisi di impresa e dell'insolvenza" (Code of business crisis
_and insolvency) (hereinafter, as subsequently amended and supplemented and including Legislative Decree_
No. 83 of 17 June 2022 implementing the EU Directive 2019/1023, the "Italian Insolvency Code"), which
was published in the Italian Official Gazette of February 14, 2019 and ultimately came into force, as
subsequently amended, on July 15, 2022.

The Italian Insolvency Code contains a comprehensive and organic reform of Italian insolvency
proceedings and the rules governing business crisis, replacing the Italian royal decree n. 267 of March 16,
1942 (as amended from time to time, the "Italian Bankruptcy Law") as the main legislative source
regulating such matter.

Before formally and fully entering into force, the Italian Insolvency Code has been amended and
supplemented by, among others, (i) the Italian Legislative Decree No. 147 of October 26, 2020; and (ii) the
Italian Legislative Decree No. 83 of June 17, 2022, on "Amendments to the Business Crisis and Insolvency
Code, implementing Directive (EU) 2019/1023" approved on March 17, 2022 by the Italian Council of
Ministers (Consiglio dei Ministri).

Except for minor changes including certain amendments to inter alia some provisions of the Italian Civil
Code, which already entered into force on March 16, 2019, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic the
entry into force of the Italian Insolvency Code was postponed multiple times. Certain innovations provided
in the Italian Insolvency Code were anticipated and introduced by Law Decree No. 118 of 24 August 2021,
as converted by Law No. 147 of 21 October 2021. Since July 15, 2022, the Italian Insolvency Code has
been fully in force.

For the sake of completeness only, it is noted that the provisions under the Italian Bankruptcy Law continue
to apply only to any filings for proposals of declaration of insolvency procedures and in-bankruptcy
compositions with creditors (concordato fallimentare) and any filings seeking for the approval of debt
restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) or for the opening of a composition with
creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo) filed or pending before July 15, 2022 (i.e., the effective date
of entrance into force of the Italian Insolvency Code).

In light of the above, the below is intended to summarize certain main aspects of the insolvency and
restructuring regime under Italian law, as currently in force, and to describe the main characterizing
elements and features of the insolvency and restructuring procedures as currently governed by the Italian
Insolvency Code, which superseded the Italian Bankruptcy Law, and further applicable pieces of
legislation.


-----

Italian creditors' rights and insolvency laws are generally considered to be more favorable to debtors than
the regimes of certain other jurisdictions. Generally speaking, in Italy, the courts play a central role in the
insolvency process; moreover, the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be time
consuming. Recently, the entrance into force of the Italian Insolvency Code has substantially amended the
Italian insolvency regime and also introduced significant amendments to the rules governing restructuring
and out-of-courts proceedings.

Under Italian law, the state of insolvency (insolvenza) of a company is ascertained and declared by a court.
Insolvency occurs at a time when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they fall
due. This must be a permanent, and not a temporary, status.

In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general,
financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which
may safeguard the existence of the company, but which may be susceptible to being reviewed by a court in
the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions, provided that certain
conditions are met.

The following restructuring or insolvency remedies and proceedings are available under Italian law for
companies facing financial difficulties or in a state of temporary crisis, and for insolvent companies:
negotiated composition of the crisis (composizione negoziata della crisi) and simplified composition with
creditors with liquidation purposes (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio), debt
restructuring arrangements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 57 of
the Italian Insolvency Code, reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56 of
the Italian Insolvency Code, restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto
_a omologazione), court-supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), extraordinary_
administration for large insolvent companies pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 270/99
(amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi imprese in crisi di cui alla Legge Prodi bis), extraordinary
administration proceedings for large insolvent companies pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 347/2003 as
converted by Law No. 39 of 18 February 2004 (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi imprese in crisi
_di cui alla Legge Marzano); judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); and composition with creditors_
in the judicial liquidation (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale).

Moreover, a specific set of rules, governing inter alia the voidability of intragroup transactions and the
ranking of intragroup financing, are applicable where the insolvent company belongs to a corporate group.

Depending on the type of proceeding to be initiated, the primary aims of restructuring and insolvency
proceedings under Italian law are, respectively and alternatively, to successfully restructure or sell the
debtor's assets as a going concern (as to the restructuring proceedings) or to liquidate the debtor's assets for
the satisfaction of creditors' claims as well as, in case of the "Prodi-bis" procedure or "Marzano" procedure,
to maintain employment, to the extent feasible. These competing aims have often been balanced by selling
businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being
sold. Save for the liquidation proceedings (mainly the judicial liquidation), the Italian Insolvency Code
promotes rescue procedures rather than liquidation and focuses on the continuity and survival of financially
distressed businesses and enhancing restructuring options as an alternative to judicial liquidation.

During judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) activities of credit recovery are interrupted (subject to
certain exceptions). During the negotiated composition with creditors (composizione negoziata della crisi)
and during the proceedings for admission to, and sanctioning of, debt restructuring arrangements with
creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti), restructuring plans subject to homologation (piano di
_ristrutturazione soggetto a omologazione) and court-supervised composition with creditors (concordato_
_preventivo), activities of credit recovery can be interrupted (provided that certain conditions apply)._

**_Judicial Liquidation_**

A request to adjudicate a debtor into judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) for the liquidation of its
assets can be filed by the debtor itself, by one or more creditors, by the bodies or authorities supervising
the company and, in certain cases, by the public prosecutor. The judicial liquidation is declared by a
competent division of the court. Entities that can be adjudicated into judicial liquidation are those exercising
commercial enterprises which exceed any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo
_patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years,_
(ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three


-----

preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess (included debts not yet due) of €0.5 million.
Upon the commencement of a judicial liquidation:

- unless otherwise provided for by law, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file
claims within a defined period; in particular, under certain circumstances, secured creditors may
enforce against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Any
outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the insolvent
entity's other unsecured debt. Subject to certain exceptions, the in rem secured creditor may sell
the secured asset only after it has obtained authorization from the designated judge (giudice
_delegato). After hearing the receiver (curatore nella liquidazione giudiziale) and the creditors'_
committee (if established), the designated judge decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets
forth the timing in its decision;

- the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets pass from the debtor to the
receiver appointed by the competent court (curatore nella liquidazione giudiziale); and

- any act (including payments, pledges and issuances of guarantees) made by the debtor, other than
those made through the receiver, after (and in certain cases even before for a limited period of time)
the commencement of a judicial liquidation with respect to the creditors is (or could be if made
before) ineffective.

The judicial liquidation proceeding is carried out and supervised by a court-appointed receiver, a deputy
judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors' committee (if established). The creditors' committee, as
specifically provided for by law, has in some cases authorization power over the receiver and, in general,
consultation functions over the latter and vigilance authority over the judicial liquidation proceedings. The
receiver is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor for the satisfaction of creditors. The
proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority rights. The liquidation of
a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor's assets include real
estate property. Italian law provides for priority to the payment of certain preferential creditors, including
the receiver, employees and the Italian judicial and social security authorities.

The following features of judicial liquidation proceedings also merit mention:

- _Statutory priorities: the statutory priority assigned to creditors under Italian law may be different_
from priorities in the United States and certain other European jurisdictions. Under Italian law,
claims with the highest rank are the super senior ones (crediti prededucibili), which include the
claims associated with the judicial liquidation proceedings as set out in specific legislation. At the
next level of priority there are preferred creditors, whose claims (crediti privilegiati) enjoy a
preference in payment (in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law) which can
be general (such as for claims for salaries, social contributions and taxes) or can pertain to specific
assets, and secured creditors, whose claims are backed by mortgages (crediti ipotecari) and pledges
(crediti garantiti da pegno), and then unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). In particular,
creditors with mortgages (crediti ipotecari) and pledges (crediti garantiti da pegno) have priority
in the distribution of what has been eventually obtained from the liquidation of the relevant secured
assets. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own
priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination
principles. Secured claims backed by mortgages and pledges will be treated as unsecured claims
for the part of the claims not being repaid upon the liquidation of the relevant secured assets. The
law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived
from the sale of the entire insolvency estate or part thereof, or from a single asset.

- _Composition with creditors in the judicial liquidation (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale):_
a judicial liquidation proceeding can terminate prior to liquidation through a composition proposal
with creditors. The relevant petition can be filed by one or more creditors or third parties starting
from the declaration that opens the judicial liquidation, whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are
admitted to file such a proposal only after one year following such declaration but before two years
from the decree granting effectiveness to the statement of liabilities. The petition may provide for
the placing of creditors into different classes (thereby proposing different treatments among the
classes), the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors' claims in any manner. The
petition may provide the possibility that secured claims are paid only in part. The concordato nella
_liquidazione giudiziale proposal is subject to the opinion of the creditors' committee and must be_


-----

approved by the creditors holding the majority of unsecured claims (and, if classes are formed, by
a majority of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court confirmation is also required;

- _Management of the debtor's company upon admission to the Judicial Liquidation: the_
commencement of a Judicial Liquidation proceeding would not cause a cessation of business
operations where a continuation order is made by the presiding judge pursuant to Article 211 of
the Italian Insolvency Code. The continuation order may be declared in each of the following
situations: (i) together with the judgment proclaiming the debtor's admission to the proceeding,
provided that the prosecution of the debtor's activities is not detrimental to creditors; (ii) after the
admission to the Judicial Liquidation, on the proposal of the liquidator and provided that such
proposal has been authorized by the creditors' committee; and (iii) at the time when the liquidation
plan shall be executed. The prosecution of the debtor activities may also be limited to specific/predetermined business lines or units; and

- _Treatment of executory contracts upon admission to the Judicial Liquidation proceeding: the_
provisions laid down by the Italian Insolvency Code allow the receiver to elect to continue or reject
future performance of executory contracts. Thus, certain types of executory contracts may be
suspended, continued or terminated by the relevant receiver. If the performance of the executory
contracts is continued, then the receiver must assume all the obligations stemming from the
continued contracts. Amounts which become due to creditors in the context of the Judicial
Liquidation proceeding must be paid in full in priority to amounts owing to other creditors.
Conversely, whether the executory contracts are terminated, creditors are entitled to submit a claim
for breach of performance, without in any event being entitled to damages by way of extracontractual liability.

_Acts Ineffective by Operation of Law._

Under (i) Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions
entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the insolvent entity in
the two-year period prior to the filing of the petition that led to the opening of the judicial liquidation of
after the filing. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 163 of the Italian
Insolvency Code becomes part of the insolvency estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione)
of the declaration of judicial liquidation, without need to wait the ineffectiveness of the transaction is
sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge for
violation of law; and (ii) Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code, payments of receivables falling due on
the day of the opening of the judicial liquidation or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if
made by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the filing of the petition that led to the opening
of the judicial liquidation of after the filing.

_Acts that Could be Declared Ineffective at the Request of the Receiver._

The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below (so-called "suspect
**period"), may be clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the insolvency estate as provided for by Article 166 of**
the Italian Insolvency Code and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had
no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor's insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into:

- onerous transactions entered into in the year before the filing of the petition that led to the opening
of the judicial liquidation of after the filing, when the value of the debt or the obligations
undertaken by the insolvent entity exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or
promised to the debtor;

- payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor in cash or by other
customary means of payment in the year prior to the filing of the petition that led to the opening of
the judicial liquidation of after the filing;

- pledges and mortgages granted by the insolvent entity in the year prior to the filing of the petition
that led to the opening of the judicial liquidation of after the filing in order to secure pre-existing
debts which were not yet due at the time when the new security was granted; and


-----

- pledges and mortgages granted by the insolvent entity in the six months prior to the filing of the
petition that led to the opening of the judicial liquidation of after the filing in order to secure preexisting debts which had already fallen due at the time when the new security was granted.

The following acts and transactions, if made during the suspect period or such other period specified below,
may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the receiver proves that the non- insolvent party
knew that the insolvent entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction:

- payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into
or made within six months prior to the filing of the petition that led to the opening of the judicial
liquidation of after the filing; and

- granting of security interest for debts incurred in the six months prior to the filing of the petition
that led to the opening of the judicial liquidation of after the filing.

The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions:

- payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market
practice;

- a remittance on a bank account; provided that it did not entail a long-term reduction of the insolvent
entity's debt towards the bank;

- the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil
Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended
as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser's family (within three degrees of kinship)
or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser;
_provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein_
or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein;

- transactions entered into, payments made and security granted by the debtor over its assets pursuant
to a plan (piano attestato) under Article 56 or 284 of the Italian Insolvency Code;

- a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee granted in execution of a "concordato
_preventivo" or a sanctioned "piano di ristrutturazione" under Article 64-bis_ of the Italian
Insolvency Code or a sanctioned "accordo di ristrutturazione del debito" as well as those legally
performed after the application for concordato preventivo or accordo di ristrutturazione;

- remuneration payments to the insolvent entity's employees and consultants concerning work
carried out by them; and

- payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to
services necessary for access to _strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell'insolvenza and_
insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Insolvency Code.

In addition, in certain cases, the receiver can request that certain transactions of the insolvent entity be
declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided
for by the Italian Civil Code. Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that
transactions whereby the insolvent entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor's rights be
declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the insolvent entity was aware of such
prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that
such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the insolvent entity for the purpose of prejudicing the
creditor's rights) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third party, the
third party was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which
the claim was originated, such third party participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is
entirely with the receiver.

Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a "simplified"
clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with
the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can
now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision


-----

clawing back/nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been
carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts
or the so-called fondo patrimoniale or "family trust"). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action
can also be carried out by the creditor against the third-party purchaser.

- **Adequate organizational, administrative and accounting corporate structures.** One of the
main novelties included in the Italian Insolvency Code concerns the definition of the organizational,
administrative and accounting structures of a company which are deemed to be adequate under
Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, required by the applicable regulations for the purpose of
timely detection of the state of crisis and the undertaking of suitable initiatives by the debtor.
Article 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code requires the entrepreneur to adopt an appropriate
organizational structure in accordance with Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, for the purpose
of timely detection of the crisis of the company as well as the timely undertaking of suitable
initiatives to overcome the crisis and recover business continuity. However, neither the
aforementioned Article 3, in its current wording, nor Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, as
amended by the Italian Insolvency Code, contains a precise description of the parameters,
conditions and characteristics that are deemed to be necessary/needed for the definition and
especially for the identification of "adequate structures."

In this regard, Article 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code precisely enunciates, on the one hand, the
purposes to which the measures and structures must aim in order to be considered as adequate for
the timely detection of the crisis and, on the other hand, the relevant warning signs in relation to
the same. In this respect, it is stipulated that, for the purpose of the timely detection of the
company's state of crisis, the measures and structures deemed to be adequate should make it
possible to:

(i) detect any imbalances of an equity or economic-financial nature, related to the specific
characteristics of the company as well as to the business activity carried out by the debtor;

(ii) verify the sustainability of debts and the prospects for business continuity for the next
twelve months as well as the warning signs identified by Article 3, paragraph 4 of the
Italian Insolvency Code; and

(iii) derive the information necessary to follow the detailed checklist and conduct the practical
test for the reasonable pursuit of the debtor's financial recovery.

For the sake of completeness and as set out above, it should also be noted that Article 3, paragraph
4 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides an exact indication of the warning signs, identified, inter
_alia, as follows:_

(i) the existence of payroll debts overdue for at least 30 days equal to more than half of the
total monthly payroll amount;

(ii) the existence of receivables owed to suppliers that are at least 90 days past due in an
amount greater than the amount of receivables that are not past due;

(iii) the existence of exposures to banks and other financial intermediaries that have been past
due for more than 60 days or have exceeded the limit of credit facilities obtained in any
form for at least 60 days provided that they represent in the aggregate at least 5% of the
total exposures; and

(iv) the existence of one or more exposures to certain public institutions listed under Article
25-novies of the Italian Insolvency Code.

**_Restructuring Outside of a Judicial Process_**

In cases where a company is solvent, but facing temporary financial difficulties, it may be possible to enter
into an out-of-court arrangement with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company.


-----

_Composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d'impresa_

The composizione negoziata della crisi is an out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in the
two following circumstances: (i) when the debtor files a petition requesting the competent court to confirm
or modify the protective measures (misure protettive, herein the "Protective Measures"), and, if necessary,
to enact conservative measures to complete the negotiations (misure conservative, herein the "Interim
**Measures" and, together with the Protective Measures, the "Measures"); and (ii) for the authorization of**
certain acts (super-senior financing and transfer of the business or of a business branch). Both the Protective
Measures and the Interim Measures are only defined in broad terms by the Italian Insolvency Code.

The _composizione negoziata della crisi can be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore_
_commerciale) - even if the general thresholds for the application of the Italian Insolvency Code are not met_

- and agricultural (imprenditore agricolo), which are in a distressed situation with reference to their assets,
their business and/or their finance, such that it is likely that a crisis or insolvency will follow and it is likely
that the financial recovery shall occur.

The composizione negoziata della crisi is commenced by the enterprises, on a voluntary basis only, with
the filing of a petition for the appointment of a third party and independent expert (the "Expert") which
however is prevented for enterprises having filed a petition pursuant to Articles 40, 44, paragraph 1 lett. a)
and 54, paragraph 3, of the Italian Insolvency Code. Pursuant to Article 25 of the Italian Insolvency Code,
the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d'impresa may also apply to group of companies,
which may commence one proceeding all together.

If the Expert finds that there are concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the parties
involved in the entrepreneur's recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic
meetings close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good
faith and with fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur's financial and
business situation, on the actions carried out or planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received
in the course of the negotiations.

If the Expert finds that there are not concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the
entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she has to promptly notify the entrepreneur and the secretary general of the
chamber of commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur's petition.

The Expert's appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties have
not agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur's
distressed situation. However, the Expert's appointment can continue for up to an additional 180 days if (i)
all the parties involved in the negotiations require so and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the
appointment is required by the fact that the entrepreneur has filed a petition to the court for the Measures
or certain authorizations.

Pursuant to Article 17(5) of the Italian Insolvency Code, during the composizione negoziata della crisi the
Expert may invite the parties to re-determine, according to good faith, the terms of the contracts for
continuous, periodic performance or deferred performance if the performance on the debtor's side has
become excessively burdensome or the contractual equilibrium has changed as a result of intervening
circumstances. The parties are required to collaborate together to re-determine the contractual terms or to
adjust the performance to the changed circumstance. Although Article 17(5) of the Italian Insolvency Code
does not include a specific power for a judge or for the Expert to amend or alter the terms of the contracts
in question if the parties are unable to find an agreement as to the changes to be made, the last sentence of
paragraph 5 of Article 17(5) of the Italian Insolvency Code provides that the parties are bound to cooperate
to amend the content of the contract.

According to Law Decree no. 118/2021, which continues to be in force although has not been transposed
into the provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code, a similar re-determination power as to the content and
terms and conditions of agreements is granted in the context of the procedure at stake to the presiding judge
where the contractual equilibrium has been jeopardized or affected by circumstances surrounding the
COVID-19 pandemic. As opposed to the scenario contemplated under Article 17(5) of the Italian
Insolvency Code, in this case the presiding judge may directly order the modification of the terms of an
agreement where alleged to give rise to a very vague standard of "excessive burden" or "changed
circumstances" due to the COVID-19 pandemic.


-----

At the end of his/her appointment the Expert issues a final report (the "Final Report") and notifies it to the
entrepreneur and to the court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any), which
declares the termination of their related effects.

Together with the petition for appointment of the Expert, or with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur
can request the application of Protective Measures. From the date of publication of the relevant petition,
preexisting creditors cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon by the
entrepreneur and all enforcement and interim actions are stayed. Payment of preexisting creditors is not
forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to employees' claims.

From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures until the
date of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for appointment of the Expert, the judicial
liquidation proceeding cannot be opened nor the entrepreneur can be declared insolvent by the court.

The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform
their obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor
anticipate their expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely
on the ground of the missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the
application of the Protective Measures.

If the entrepreneur applies for the Protective Measures (which, as said, are immediately effective), it must
simultaneously file a petition to the competent court, in order to allow a judge to check the said Protective
Measures and to confirm them or, if necessary, to modify them. In the context of the same petition, the
debtor may also ask the judge to be granted with Interim Measures where such measure are necessary to
conduct the negotiations with the creditors in the context of the Negotiated Composition. In the absence of
this petition, the Protective Measures will be ineffective.

The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by an order
of the court in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the
opinion of the Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a
maximum of 240 days.

Upon request of the entrepreneur or of one or more creditors, or upon report of the Expert, the Protective
Measures and the Interim Measures can be revoked, or their duration can be reduced, if they do not satisfy
the purpose of a positive finalization of the negotiations or appear to be disproportionate compared to the
prejudice caused to the creditors that file the relevant request. If the Protective Measures are revoked, the
prohibition on creditors from pursuing enforcement actions ceases to be effective for the date on which the
Protective Measure has been revoked.

During the procedure the entrepreneur remains able to continue the ordinary and extraordinary management
of the company, subject to certain conditions. More precisely, pursuant to Article 21 of the Italian
Insolvency Code, pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary
activity, and, upon written notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary activity or make
payments non-consistent with the negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery. Furthermore, if during
the course of the negotiations, it appears that the entrepreneur is insolvent but there are real prospects of
recovery, the entrepreneur shall manage the enterprise in the best interests of the creditors, subject to his
liabilities.

If the Expert believes that an extraordinary management act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the
negotiations or to the perspectives of recovery, he/she reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the
enterprise's control body. If, notwithstanding the Expert's report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant
act, the entrepreneur gives immediate notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration
with the companies' register. Extraordinary management acts and the payments in relation to which the
Expert's dissent has been registered may be subject to a claw-back action (and thus set aside) according to
Articles 165 and 166 of the Italian Insolvency Code.


-----

The court, upon the entrepreneur's request and to the extent that this is consistent with the continuation of
the business as a going concern and with the maximization of the creditors' recovery, may authorize:

(a) the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new super-senior
indebtedness (so called "prededucibile") pursuant to Article 22, paragraph 1, lett. a) and lett. c) of
the Italian Insolvency Code;

(b) the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior indebtedness (prededucibile) via shareholders'
financing pursuant to Article 22, paragraph 1, lett. b) of the Italian Insolvency Code;

(c) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided
under Article 2560, paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code, pursuant to Article 22, paragraph 1, lett.
d) of the Italian Insolvency Code. However, in such case it will be for the court itself to identify
the measures it considers appropriate, taking into account the requests of the parties concerned, in
order to protect the interests of all relevant parties involved.

The composizione negoziata della crisi can terminate as follows:

(a) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which constitutes
cause for application of special the reward measures provided if, according to the Expert's Final
Report, such agreement ensures the continuation of the business as a going concern for at least 2
years;

(b) execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 62 of the Italian
Insolvency Code;

(c) execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert, with the
effects provided under Article 166, paragraph 3, letter d), and 324 of the Italian Insolvency Code.
In such case, the independent expert's report (attestazione) shall not be required.

At the end of the negotiations, the entrepreneur can also file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt
restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti).

Alternatively, the entrepreneur may:

(a) arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento);

(b) file a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio;

(c) enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Insolvency Code or in the
so-called Prodi-bis procedure or Marzano procedure, should the requirements provided for by law
be met.

Potential outcomes: concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio (introduced by Law Decree
118/2021)

The Italian Insolvency Code provides for a streamlined court-supervised composition with creditors with
liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio).

If, in its Final Report, the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome but have been
conducted according to fairness and in good faith, and that the options provided under Article 23 of the
Italian Insolvency Code are not feasible, within 60 days following the notification of the Final Report the
entrepreneur may file, with the competent court of the place where the company has its registered office, a
petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a
liquidation plan and the documents listed under Article 39 of the Italian Insolvency Code, which may divide
the creditors into various classes. The petition for _concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del_
_patrimonio is then published in the companies' register within the day following the filing with the court._
From the date of such publication, the effects provided under Articles 6, 46, 94 and 96 apply.

The court issues a decree of approval (omologazione) the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del
_patrimonio when it finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with relevant laws and_
regulations and the adversarial principle among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal is compliant


-----

with rules governing claim ranking (cause di prelazione) and the liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii) the
proposal does not cause a prejudice to the creditors compared to what they would receive in case of
insolvent liquidation of the entrepreneur, and in any case ensures that each creditor receives a certain
recovery.

The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the above-mentioned decree within 30 days after having
been notified of the same.

**_Certified Restructuring Plans Pursuant to Article 56 of the Italian Insolvency_** **_Code (piani attestati di_**
**_risanamento)_**

For the purpose of restructuring their indebtedness and ensuring the recovery of their financial condition,
debtors may enter into agreements based on restructuring plans (piani attestati di risanamento) the
feasibility of which, together with the truthfulness of debtor's business (and accounting) data, must be
assessed by an independent expert directly appointed by the debtor. The expert can only be selected and
appointed among those possessing certain specific professional requisites and qualifications (e.g., being
registered in the auditors' registrar), and meeting the requirements under Article 2399 of the Italian Civil
Code. The expert may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification.

Agreements based on restructuring plans are not under any form of judicial control or approval and,
therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or other supervising authority. Out-of-court
agreements based on restructuring plans do not require to be approved and consented by a specific majority
of all outstanding claims. Following a restructuring plan, there is no entrustment of business to another
entity, therefore the debtor remains entitled to manage its business.

The terms and conditions of the agreements based on restructuring plans are freely negotiable. Agreements
based on restructuring plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or
precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Insolvency Code provides that, should these plans
fail and the debtor be adjudicated into judicial liquidation, the payments and/or acts carried out for the
implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to claw-back
action; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification
by the court nor publication in the companies' register are needed (although, upon request of the debtor, the
agreements based on the restructuring plan, the plan itself and the report of the independent expert
(attestazione) can be published in the relevant companies' register and, in such case creditors would benefit
from a reduction in debtor tax liability).

**_Debt Restructuring Agreements with Creditors Pursuant to Article 57 of the_** **_Italian Insolvency Code_**
**_(accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti)_**

The debtor may negotiate with creditors holding at least 60% of the total amount of claims or debt
restructuring agreements, subject to court's approval (omologazione). An independent expert appointed by
the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and
declare that the agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully
satisfied within the following terms: (a) 120 days from the date of approval of the agreement by the court,
in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the
approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from the date
on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the nonparticipating creditors as at the date of the validation (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement
by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation of "financial distress" (i.e., facing financial
crisis which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court's validation
(omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors.

The application for accordo di ristrutturazione is published in the companies' register and is effective as of
the day of its publication. Starting from the date of such publication and if the debtor requested protective
measures, creditors cannot start or continue any conservative or enforcement actions against the assets of
the debtor in relation to pre-existing receivables and cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in
relation to pre-existing debts. Protective measures must be confirmed by the Court for a maximum 4-month
period, which can be extended upon request. According to Article 64 of the Italian Insolvency Code, if the
debtor files a petition for Protective Measures, creditors may not unilaterally refuse to perform executory
contracts or terminate/accelerate such contracts or modify the terms thereof solely due to the filing of such
petition. Any contractual provisions to the contrary are without effect.


-----

Moreover, Article 64(4) of the Italian Insolvency Code goes on to provide that creditors affected by
Protective Measures may not unilaterally refuse to perform, terminate, amend or accelerate any "essential
contracts" solely due to the failure in payment by the debtor. For the purpose of the Italian Insolvency Code,
"essential contracts" are those agreements which are considered necessary for the continuation of the
ordinary/day-to-day management of the company, including supply contracts whose interruption would
prevent the continuation of the activity of the debtor.

The plan can therefore provide, among others, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by
a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria,
write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed
tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

The protective measures can also be requested by the debtor while negotiations with creditors are pending
(i.e., prior to the above-mentioned publication of the agreement), provided that the debtor files a declaration
of an independent expert attesting that (i) negotiations are ongoing with creditors representing at least 60%
of claims owned; and (ii) the plan (if approved) is adequate to ensure the repayments in full of the nonadhering creditors or the creditors who have denied their willingness to negotiate the plan. A court order is
needed for the protective measures to be granted.

Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the validation of the debt restructuring agreement within
30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies' register. After having settled the
oppositions (if any) the court will validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within
30 days of its publication.

The threshold of 60% is reduced to the 30% pursuant to Article 60 of the Italian Insolvency Code, if the
debtor (a) waives the 120-day term for the satisfaction of non-participating creditors (therefore implying
that the plan must be adequate and capable for the full and timely payment of dissenting creditors); (b) does
not request and waives to request the protective measures.

Debtors are entitled to extend the application of debt restructuring agreements to non-participating creditors
(including financial creditors) by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits
belonging to the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their legal status and economic
interests), and can request the court to declare that agreement binding on non-adhering creditors of the same
category (a so- called "cram-down"), _provided that certain conditions are met, including that non-_
participating creditors shall be satisfied to a no lesser extent than the liquidation alternative. The law also
provides that (i) the agreement shall be of a non-liquidating nature, (ii) the agreement shall contemplate the
direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern, and (iii) all the creditors belonging
to the relevant category (and, therefore, affected by the proceeding) have been duly notified of the beginning
of the negotiations, have been kept informed and have been notified the debt restructuring agreement and
the sanctioning decree (decreto di omologa) and the related documentation. If these conditions are met, the
remaining 25% of non-participating creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down;
however, non-participating crammed down creditors can challenge the debt restructuring agreement.

The threshold of 75% is lowered to 60% if the conclusion of the debt restructuring agreement results from
the Final Report issued by the Expert at the end of the negotiations pertaining to the composizione negoziata
_della crisi._

A special provision is set forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total
indebtedness: in this situation the debt restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of
creditors which are banks and financial intermediaries which have a homogeneous legal position and
economic interests and extend the effects of the agreement to non-participating creditors who are part of
the same category. In such instance, the agreement is valid even if it does not contemplate the direct or
indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern. However, in such case, the rights of
creditors who are not banks or financial intermediaries remain valid.

A standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and creditors representing
75% of the same class would also bind the non-participating creditors, provided that (A) an independent
expert certifies **_(i) the truthfulness of the business data,_** **_(ii)_** the attitude of the standstill agreement to
temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis and **_(iii)_** the fact that the non-adhering creditors suffer a
prejudice that is proportionate and consistent with the recovery strategies undertaken by the debtor, and (B)
certain further conditions are met (e.g., all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly


-----

noticed of the beginning of the negotiations have been made able to participate in the negotiations and have
received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor's assets, economic and financial situation and
on the agreement and its related effects). Non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the
standstill agreement within 30 days after having been notified of the same.

The debt restructuring agreement and the standstill agreement shall not impose new obligations, the
granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the
utilization of new facilities on non-participating creditors.

Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors that have adhered to the debt restructuring
agreements. Non-participating creditors maintain their claims towards (i) those who are jointly and
severally liable with the debtor, (ii) the debtor's guarantors and (iii) debtors by way of right of recourse
(regresso). Unless agreed otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards the shareholders
who are jointly liable with non- limited liability companies, provided that, if such shareholders have granted
guarantees, they will remain liable as guarantors.

**_Court-Supervised Composition with Creditors Pursuant to Article 84 of the Italian Insolvency_** **_Code_**
**_(concordato preventivo)_**

The court-supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) ("CP") proceeding can be
commenced if the thresholds indicated under the first paragraph of "Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations—Italy—Judicial Liquidation" are met._

A company, which is a situation of "financial distress and/or crisis" that has not been declared insolvent by
the court, has the option to seek an arrangement with its creditors, under court supervision, in order to
compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of
insolvency and the initiation of a judicial liquidation proceeding.

Only the debtor company can file a petition at court for a CP which must be accompanied and supported
by a restructuring plan proposed to the creditors and an independent expert report assessing, inter alia, the
feasibility of the arrangement proposal and the truthfulness of the business data on which the plan is
grounded. Following the filing of the petition with the court, the petition is published by the court in the
companies' register. The debtor can apply for Protective Measures. In addition, during this time, preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and the mortgages
registered within 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the CP is published in the Italian
companies' register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. In addition, the arrangement proposal
may provide for, inter alia: (i) the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors' claims (provided
_that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of_
composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato in continuità aziendale), in
any manner, including by way of example, through extraordinary transactions such as the granting to
creditors and their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (also convertible into shares), or
other financial instruments and debt securities; (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations
of the business involved in the proposed arrangement agreement; (iii) the placing of creditors into different
classes (thereby proposing different treatments among the classes) (classes are mandatory when the
restructuring plan provides for the business continuity); and (iv) different treatments for creditors belonging
to different classes.

Pursuant to Article 84, paragraph 4, the Italian Insolvency Code, in order to strengthen the position of the
unsecured creditors, a composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato
_liquidatorio) (i.e., a composition with creditors proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors_
and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that (i) with the
relevant filing for such proceeding, external resources are contributed which increase the assets available
at the time of such filing by at least 10% and (ii) the degraded secured creditors as well as unsecured
creditors are paid in a percentage equal to 20% of their total claims. In this respect, it should be noted that
resources contributed for the purpose of a composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose
(concordato liquidatorio) may be distributed notwithstanding the provisions set forth under Articles 2740
and 2741 of the Italian Civil Code provided that such distribution complies with the 20% requirement set
forth above. Resources contributed are considered as "external" when provided for any reason by the
debtor's shareholders without obligation of repayment or subordination, in relation to which the plan


-----

provides them to be for the sole benefit of the creditors. This provision does not apply to composition with
creditors proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

Where the composition with creditors pursues the continuation strategy, creditors are prevented from
unilaterally refusing the performance of executory contracts, terminating or accelerating such contract or
amending their terms solely due to the filing of petition for admission to the procedure at stake, a court
order granting such petition and/or a court granting Protective Measures. Any contractual provision to the
contrary is without effect. The Italian Insolvency Code then goes on to further provide that creditors
impacted by Protective Measures may not unilaterally refuse to perform, terminate, accelerate or amend
"essential" agreements solely due to a failure in payment by the debtor prior to the filing of the petition
seeking admission to the composition with creditors procedure.

The restructuring plan can provide that: (i) the debtor's company's business continues to be run by the debtor
company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets
which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated. In both cases, the petition for the CP
should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the
business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The
report of the independent expert shall also certify that the continuation of the business (if envisaged by the
plan) is not detrimental to creditors compared to a judicial liquidation. Furthermore the going concernbased composition with creditors can provide also the liquidation of those assets which are not functional
to the business. The arrangement agreement may also provide a proposed tax settlement for the partial or
deferred payment of certain taxes.

The court determines whether the proposal for the arrangement is admissible, in which case the court, inter
_alia, delegates a judge (giudice delegato) to follow the procedure, appoints one or more judicial_
commissioners (commissari giudiziali) and sets the timeframe and modalities for creditors to express their
vote. After filing for composition with creditors, the company is managed by its corporate bodies (usually
its board of directors) under the supervision of such judicial officer(s) and under the supervision of a judge
delegated by the court, and the debtor is allowed to carry out activities falling out of the ordinary course of
business only upon the prior court's authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim acts legally
carried out by the debtor, rank super-prior.

The CP proposal envisaging the liquidation must be approved with the favorable vote of creditors
representing the majority of claims entitled to vote. If the proposal provides for different classes of creditors,
the approval of the plan also requires the favorable vote of creditors representing the majority of claims
admitted to within each class and the approval of the majority of such class. In the event that a single
creditor has claims in excess of the majority of the claims entitled to vote, the CP proposal is approved with
the favorable vote of (i) creditors having the majority of claims entitled to vote, and (ii) the majority of
creditors entitled to vote. When business continuity is envisages by the plan, the composition must be
approved by all classes. Secured creditors do not generally vote on the proposal of CP as they carry
preferential claims, which must be fully satisfied. Secured creditors may vote if they waive their security
or if the CP provides that, based on an independent expert appraisal on the value of the secured assets, they
will not be fully satisfied (in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of the debt affected by the
proposal).

In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the concordato proceedings, the interactions between (i)
the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable
majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable
Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian
companies are largely untested in the Italian courts (recent case law has however affirmed the right of
noteholders whose vote may be tainted by conflict of interest as could be the case of disenfranchised
noteholders to be computed for the purposes of relevant quora and be admitted to voting, albeit in a specific
class).

Among others, (i) the companies controlling the debtor, controlled by the debtor and those under the control
of the entity controlling the debtor, (ii) the assignees of the claims of the entities under point (i), if the
assignment has been perfected during the year preceding the concordato and (iii) creditors in conflict of
interest are excluded from voting. The court may approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the
circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii)
the court deems that the interests of the non-adhering creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it
compared to other solutions (in particular in comparison with the judicial liquidation).


-----

The court approves the concordato preventivo even in the absence of a vote by the tax authority or by the
social contribution entities (enti gestori di forme di previdenza o assistenza obbligatorie) when their
positive vote is decisive for the purposes of achieving the majorities referred to in Article 109, paragraph 1
of the Italian Insolvency Code, also on the basis of the result of the report of the independent expert referred
to in Article 88 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the proposal to satisfy the aforesaid authorities and entities
is convenient compared to a judicial liquidation scenario.

In case of business continuity, the Court can validate the plan even when not all classes voted in favor of
the composition and the debtor so requests, occurring certain conditions, including that creditors of
dissenting class are treated equally with respect to the same rank classes and better than creditors of classes
ranking lower.

If in the composition with business continuity the creditor opposes the validation of the composition on the
basis that this is not convenient, the Court can still validate the same creditor is better treated than in a
judicial liquidation scenario.

If liquidation is envisaged by the plan, the court can also validate the CP when - if the proposal does not
provide for classes of creditors and if any opposition to the validation of the CP is filed by at least 20% of
the creditors entitled to vote, or in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a
dissenting class, entitled to vote, - the treatment of the relevant creditors' claims not detrimental compared
to a judicial liquidation.

Creditors holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor are entitled to present an alternative
plan to the debtor's plan in a CP subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the
proposal of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari).

If a plan in a CP includes a binding offer for the sale of the debtor's assets or of a going concern of the
debtor to an identified third party, the court starts an auction.

After the creditors' approval, the court (after having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting
creditors, if any) must validate the CP proposal by issuing a validation order.

If the approval of the CP fails, the court can, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor and after
having ascertained the condition for declaration, adjudicate the company into judicial liquidation.

The terms and the performance of the outstanding contracts which have been entered into, from time to
time, by the debtor are not automatically affected by the concordato preventivo proceeding and normally
continue pending the procedure, any agreement to the contrary being ineffective. However, pursuant to
Article 97 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to
terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti) if the
continuation of such agreements is inconsistent with the prospects and the execution of the composition
with creditors' plan, except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision
The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application for the
_concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the_
procedure. Upon the debtor's request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time
_(a)_ between 30 and 60 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one
possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension
(giustificati motivi) or in the event where filings for a judicial liquidation proceeding are pending, renewable
just once. When the composition proposal together with the relevant plan have been submitted, the
suspension may also be authorized by the court for a further duration, which, however, may not exceed
thirty days from the date of the decree opening the procedure, which may not be further extended. In such
circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered
for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid in accordance to the
_concordato preventivo proposal as a pre-existing claim._

Pursuant to Articles 119 and 120 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the event of a breach of the composition
with creditors plan or fraud, _provided that the relevant requirements are met, the_ _concordato_ can be
terminated or annulled, as the case may be, upon petition of one or more of the creditors and the judicial
liquidation may follow, at the behest of the relevant court. If the composition with creditors is implemented,
terms and conditions of payments are amended as per the concordato proposal, and the debtor may return
to its usual operations (if the assets of the company are still in his possession). Concordato preventivo is


-----

compulsory for all creditors prior to the publication of the application in the companies' register. However,
creditors retain without prejudice their rights against co-debtors and guarantors of the debtor.

In case of non-minor breaches, the concordato may be terminated by each of the creditors or the judicial
commissioner (in case of petition by one or more of the creditors). The relevant lawsuit must be brought
within one year from the deadline originally scheduled for the last activity to be carried out under the
_concordato itself. The concordato may also be annulled upon request of the judicial commissioner or of_
one or more creditors in case a portion of the assets of the debtor has been concealed or the liabilities have
been willfully exaggerated. The relevant lawsuit must be brought within six months from the discovery of
the concealment/exaggeration and, in any event, within two years from the deadline originally scheduled
for the last activity to be carried out under the concordato itself.

**_Filing of a petition with reservation (ricorso con riserva di deposito di documentazione), in view of a_**
**_composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), of a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di_**
**_ristrutturazione del debito) or of a restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione_**
**_soggetto a omologazione)_**

The filing of the application for the validation of a debt restructuring arrangement (accordo di
_ristrutturazione del debito) or for the validation of a restructuring plan (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto_
_a omologazione)_ and the application for a composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) may be
preceded by the filing by the debtor of a pre-application with reservation (ricorso con riserva di deposito
_di documentazione). In particular, the distressed company can file a pre-application asking the competent_
court to set a deadline, between 30 and 60 days (subject to a further extension of up to 60 days) for the
filing of additional documents required for the filing of a petition at court for a CP or for the filing of a
restructuring plan or of a debt restructuring agreement. The court can appoint a judicial commissioner to
overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article
106 of the Italian Insolvency Code (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more
claims, declaration of non-existent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), shall report it to the
court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition and sets forth reporting and information
duties of the company during the above mentioned period. The decree setting the term for the presentation
of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (relating also to the financial
management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application
and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the
term established by the court. The debtor company shall file, on a monthly basis, the company's financial
position, which is published, the following day, in the companies register. Noncompliance with these
requirements results in the pre-application being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors,
of the public prosecutor or of the bodies or authorities supervising the company and _provided that the_
relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into judicial liquidation.
If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of
the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, _ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if_
appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following
the filing of the pre application and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the
distressed company may (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary course of business and (ii) seek the
court's authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its extraordinary course of business, to the extent they
are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior
indebtedness authorized by the court are treated as super priority claims (prededucibili) and the related acts,
payments and security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action.

_Interim financing - Article 99 Paragraph 1 to 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code_

Pursuant to Article 99, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the context of restructuring
transactions on a going concern basis, also in cases in which business continuity is maintained exclusively
in a view of liquidation, the Court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring
agreement pursuant to Article 57 (or Article 60 or 61) of the Italian Insolvency Code or a petition pursuant
to Article 87 of the Italian Insolvency Code (in relation to the court-supervised composition with creditors
procedure described above) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested to incur in new super senior
indebtedness and to secure such indebtedness, subject to the court's authorization with in rem security
(garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, _provided that: (i) the petition specifies (A) the purpose of the_
financing; (B) that the debtor is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (C) that the absence of
such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the going concern or to the proceedings;
and (ii) the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until


-----

the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financing are functional to the continuity of the
business activities until the sanctioning (omologazione) of the relevant insolvency proceedings or to the
opening of the proceedings or to conduct them and, in any case, are aimed at providing a better satisfaction
of the rights of the creditors. The expert report is not necessary in case the court recognizes that there is the
urgent need to avoid an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the going concern. In the event of the
subsequent admission of the debtor to the judicial liquidation proceeding (liquidazione giudiziale), the
aforementioned financings do not enjoy the super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case the petition
or the expert report contain false data or omit important information or in case the debtor performed acts in
fraud of the creditors (atti in frode ai creditori) and the judicial receiver proves that who made available
such financings to the debtor, had knowledge of such circumstances at the date of the disbursement.

_Bridge Financings - Article 99 Paragraph 5 of the Italian Insolvency Code_

Pursuant to Article 99, paragraph 5, of the Italian Insolvency Code, financings (together with the related
claims) granted, in any form, in view of (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for the sanctioning
(omologazione) of a debt restructuring agreement or a court-supervised composition with creditors
(concordato preventivo) (finanza ponte), may be granted such priority status provided that (i) they meet the
requirements of Article 99, paragraphs 1 and 2 (described above), and (ii) it is envisaged by the relevant
plan or agreement and that such priority status is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval
of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement or the approval of the
_concordato preventivo. The indebtedness under such financing option may be secured, subject to the court's_
authorization, with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims.

_Implementation financing - Article 101 of the Italian Insolvency Code_

In restructuring transactions on a going concern basis, pursuant to Article 101 of the Italian Insolvency
Code, any financing granted to the debtor pursuant to a debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised
pre-judicial liquidation composition with creditors) sanctioned by the competent court and expressly
provided for in the relevant plan, enjoy super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent
judicial liquidation, save for the below according with the provisions set forth in Article 221 of Italian
Insolvency Code. In the event of the subsequent admission of the debtor to the judicial liquidation
proceeding (liquidazione giudiziale), the aforementioned financings do not enjoy the super senior priority
status (prededucibilità) in case the composition plan or the debt restructuring agreement, on the basis of an
assessment to be made at the time of the relevant filing, results to be based upon false data or omission of
relevant information or in case the debtor performed acts in fraud of the creditors (atti in frode ai creditori)
and the judicial receiver proves that who made available such financings to the debtor, had knowledge of
such circumstances at the date of the disbursement.

_The shareholders' financing — Article 102 of the Italian Insolvency Code_

Pursuant to Article 102, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code super senior ranking status also applies
to any financings made available by shareholders in any form (including any guarantee facility or granting
counter-indemnities) up to 80% of their amount.

Paragraph 2 of Article 102 of the Italian Insolvency Code clarifies that, to the extent the financing is made
available by an entity becoming a shareholder in the context of and by way of implementation of a
composition with creditors or debt restructuring agreement, all the claims deriving from such financings
benefit of super senior ranking status and the 80% threshold limitation set out in paragraph 1 does not apply.

_Super senior ranking - Article 99 Paragraph 6 and 101 Paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code_

Super senior ranking _(prededucibilità) of the claims is the most relevant feature of bridge financings,_
interim financings and implementation financings as described in the paragraphs above.

Pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the claims deriving from such financings
are expressly qualified as super senior by law and by Article 6, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code
which clarifies that their super senior ranking natures continues in the context of any subsequent insolvency
or enforcement proceedings (including in a judicial liquidation or any so-called minor proceedings).

As already explained above, super senior ranking nature of such financings will be excluded in case of acts
of fraud (which may be relevant also in the context of debt restructuring agreements).


-----

Such limit to super senior ranking is regulated differently for interim financings and bridge financings on
the one side and for the implementation financings on the other side.

More specifically, for interim financings or bridge financings false data or omission of relevant information
are relevant when found by the court in the request for the incurrence of the financings or the attestation of
the independent expert, whilst for implementation financings such elements are relevant when on included
in plan underlying the composition with creditors or the debt restructuring agreement.

With reference to interim financings and bridge financings, Article 99 paragraph 6 of the Italian Insolvency
Code provides that, in case of the opening of a judicial liquidation, such financings (although authorized
by the court in the context of the composition with creditors or the debt restructuring agreement) do not
benefit from super senior ranking when it is proved (jointly) that:

(a) the request or the independent expert report contains false data or omits relevant information, or
when the debtor has committed acts to defraud creditors in order to obtain the authorization; and

(b) the receiver proves that the entities who provided the financing, at the date of issuance, knew the
aforementioned circumstances.

With reference to implementation financings, the relevant provisions are set out in Article 101 paragraph 2
of the Italian Insolvency Code providing that such financings do not benefit from the super senior ranking,
in case of the opening of a judicial liquidation (alternatively):

(a) when, based on an assessment to be made at the time of filing of the petition for the opening of the
proceeding, the plan underlying the composition with creditors or debt restructuring agreement
turns out to be based on false data or on the omission of relevant information; or

(b) when the debtor has carried out acts of fraud towards its creditors and the receiver proves that the
lenders providing the financings were aware of such circumstances at the time of the establishment
of the financings.

**_Restructuring Plan Subject to Homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione)_**

An important novelty concerns the crisis regulation procedures governed by Title IV of Part I of the Italian
Insolvency Code, is the new figure of the restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di
_ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) (the so-called "PRO," the rules of which are set out in the new_
Articles 64-bis and 64-ter of the Italian Insolvency Code).

This new tool takes the form of a restructuring framework that may disregard the distribution rules of
regular insolvency proceedings but can be enacted provided that strict requirements are met. In this regard,
it should be noted that recourse to this instrument will be reserved for a debtor in crisis or insolvent that
plans to satisfy its creditors by dividing them into classes according to homogeneous legal positions and
economic interests. This instrument allows the plan's proceeds to be distributed even in derogation of the
principle of "par condicio creditorum" (i.e., the equal treatment of creditors), provided that the proposal is
approved by unanimous consent of the classes. A judgement of admissibility is provided for by the court,
which is called upon to assess the proposal's timeliness and to verify the correctness of the class formation
criteria.

Application for the approval by the court of a restructuring plan must follow the steps of the common
framework applicable to all restructuring tools and frameworks (i.e., _concordato preventivo, debt_
restructuring agreement and also to judicial liquidation). The regulation of the restructuring plan subject to
homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), from the date of submission of the
application until its approval, is based on the model of the negotiated crisis settlement: the entrepreneur
maintains the ordinary and extraordinary management of the company in the prevailing interest of the
creditors under the supervision of the judicial commissioner. The debtor is, in any case, allowed to amend
the application at any time, formulating a proposal of composition with creditors (concordato preventivo).
In that case, the time limit for approval is shortened. Similarly, the debtor that has filed an application for
composition with creditors may amend the application by applying for approval of the restructuring plan
_provided that the application is made before voting commences. In each class, the proposal is approved if_
a majority of the claims allowed to vote is reached or, failing that, if two-thirds of the claims of the voting
creditors have voted in favor, provided that creditors holding at least half of the total claims of the same
class have voted. The court will approve the restructuring plan in the event of approval by all classes. If a


-----

dissenting creditor objects to the proposal, the court will approve and homologate the restructuring plan if
the proposal satisfies the claim to a not lesser extent than the one resulting from a judicial liquidation. In
summary the restructuring plan subject to homologation _(piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad_
_omologazione) thus represents for the debtor an opportunity instrument which minimizes the admissibility_
phase, providing greater freedom of action, but requiring the approval of all classes of creditors in order to
be effectively approved.

Against the judgment of the court ruling on the approval of the restructuring plan subject to homologation
_(piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), the parties may file an appeal to the competent court_
of appeal within the term of 30 days from the notification of the relevant judgement of the court.

_Court-supervised composition for small debtors_

The Italian Insolvency Code provides for a simplified court-supervised composition in case the debtor does
not meet the dimensional requirements to access other restructuring tools.

Procedural steps and effects do essentially mimic those of the _concordato preventivo, but it entails the_
involvement of the board for crisis settlement (organismo di risoluzione della crisi), which assists the debtor
in preparing the paperwork and filing the petition, and performs the activities and duties which, in a
_concordato preventivo are prerogatives of the judicial commissioner._

**_Extraordinary Administration for Large Insolvent Companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle_**
**_grandi imprese in stato di insolvenza)_**

This is an extraordinary administration procedure available under Italian law for large industrial and
commercial enterprises (commonly referred to as the "Prodi-bis procedure"). The same rules set forth for
the judicial liquidation proceeding with respect to creditors' claims largely apply to an extraordinary
administration proceeding as well as the hierarchy of claims to be adhered to in distributing any available
asset. Preferential payment is granted to those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the
company business activity.

To qualify for this procedure, the company must have employed at least 200 employees in the previous
year. In addition, it must have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial
statements and two-thirds of its income from sales and services during its last financial year. The procedure
may be commenced by petition of one or more creditors, the debtor, the public prosecutor or upon the
competent court's own initiative.

There are two main phases within the Prodi-bis procedure: an administrative phase and a judicial phase.

In the administrative phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and
whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints a judicial receiver (or three)
(commissario giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale
or reorganization. The judicial receiver submits a report to the court (within 30 days from insolvency
declaration) together with an opinion from the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (the "Ministry").

The court has 30 days to decide whether to admit the company to the Prodi-bis procedure or adjudicate it
into judicial liquidation.

Assuming that the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the judicial phase
begins and the extraordinary commissioner(s), appointed by the Ministry, prepare a restructuring plan.
From the date of commencement, creditors are prohibited from undertaking or continuing executive
measures against the debtors or its assets. Moreover, there is a provision to the effect that, until such time
as the administrator elects to reject the performance of outstanding executory contracts, the contracts will
continue to be subject to performance. The plan can provide for either the sale of the business as a going
concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the "Disposal Plan") or a turnaround leading
to the company's economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the
"Recovery Plan"). It may also include an arrangement with creditors (e.g., debt for equity swap, issue of
shares in a new company to whom the assets of the Issuer have been transferred).

The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary
commissioner(s). The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or Recovery
Plan; however, should either plan fail, the company will adjudicated into judicial liquidation.


-----

**_Industrial Restructuring of Large Insolvent Companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese_**
**_in stato di insolvenza)_**

Extraordinary administration proceedings for largest insolvent companies have been enacted (with Italian
Law Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, as converted into Law No. 39 of 2004 and subsequently
amended. This is an extraordinary administration procedure introduced in 2003, known as the "Marzano
procedure." It is complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same
provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to be faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example,
although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court
commences the judicial phase.

The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at
least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt
(including those from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken
by the Ministry following the debtor's request (who must also file an application for the declaration of
insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the
extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company's
insolvency.

The extraordinary commissioner(s) submits a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan within 180 days from his
appointment (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees). The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the
Recovery Plan must be fully implemented within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two
years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will adjudicate the company
into judicial liquidation.

In 2008, the Italian government enacted an amendment to Law No. 39 of 2004. The reform introduced
certain specific provisions applying to large companies carrying out services considered essential to the
public.

**_Common Rules for Pre-Judicial Liquidation Restructuring Frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della_**
**_crisi e dell'insolvenza della società_**

In order to facilitate access and filing of restructuring procedures by the Italian companies, Articles 120_bis and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code have been enacted, introducing a set of rules applicable to all pre-_
judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell'insolvenza). Among other
things, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code and for the purposes of a
successful restructuring, the plan may provide for "any modification of the articles of association of the
_debtor company, including capital increases and reductions, including with limitation or exclusion of the_
_option right and other modifications that directly affect the shareholders' participation rights, as well as_
_for mergers, demergers and transformations." Shareholders, who may no longer have an interest in the_
company, are prevented from hindering the restructuring or even one of its stages. For this reason, pursuant
to Article 120-bis, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the shareholders, while retaining a
right to information in relation to both the initiation and the progress of the restructuring process, may not
remove the directors without just cause, as is the case for the statutory auditors of joint stock companies,
also in light of the fact that under the provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code it is not considered as being
just cause for directors' removal, the filing for access to the pre- judicial liquidation restructuring tools
(strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell'insolvenza) when the related legal conditions and requirements
are met. However, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraph 5, shareholders representing at least 10% of the
filing company's corporate capital may make a competing proposal.

The plan may provide for the formation of one class of shareholders or several classes if there are
shareholders to whom different rights are granted by the by-laws, including as a result of the changes
provided for in the plan. The formation of classes is, however, mandatory if the plan provides for changes
that directly affect the shareholders' participation rights and, in any case, for large companies and companies
with widespread capital. In this context, special conditions for approval of the composition with creditors
are set out pursuant to Article 120-quater of the Italian Insolvency Code when and if the plan provides for
shareholder attributions. Specific rules are then provided to ensure that creditors' interests are protected in
all cases in which the restructuring tool envisages shareholders to retain a participation in the company with
a certain value.


-----

Article 120-quinquies of the Italian Insolvency Code, regulates the execution phase of such measure. In
order to avoid any obstructive attitude of the shareholders towards the approval of the restructuring tool,
this provision expressly excludes the necessity for their approval and/or resolution on the implementation
of such restructuring tool, by generally attributing the relevant powers to the directors or more specifically
to the competent court, in relation to any amendment to the debtor's by-laws which - being specifically
provided for by the plan - do not require any discretionary resolution. Finally, it is stipulated that changes
in the corporate structure resulting from the implementation of a pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools
(strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell'insolvenza) shall not be considered as and constitute cause for
the termination or amendment of any agreement entered into by the debtor with third parties.

Articles 284 and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code contain specific rules regarding (i) the access of a group
to one of the pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e
_dell'insolvenza) aiming at unifying — to the extent possible — the relevant proceedings; (ii) liability_
lawsuits available to the receiver; and (iii) subordination of claims.

**_Limitations on Guarantees and Security Interests_**

Under Italian Law the obligations under the Indenture of a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy
(the "Italian Guarantor") are subject to compliance with the applicable laws and its constitutional
documents, the rules on corporate benefit and corporate authorization. If the guarantee or security interests
are being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring,
financial assistance issues may also be triggered.

An Italian company granting a guarantee or security interests must receive a real and adequate benefit in
exchange for the guarantee or the security interests being provided by such company. In relation to security
interests or guarantees, while corporate benefit for a downstream security or guarantee (i.e., a security or a
guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries (pursuant to Article 2359
of the Italian Civil Code) of that relevant guarantor) can usually be easily proved, the validity and
effectiveness of an upstream and cross-stream guarantees (i.e., a security or a guarantee granted to secure
financial obligations of direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant guarantor), depends on
the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and
may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive some benefits or advantages from
the granting of such guarantee or security. In particular, in case of upstream and cross-stream security
interests or guarantees for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial
consideration in the form of a guarantee fee or access to cash flows in the form of intercompany loans from
other members of the Group.

The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation and is determined on a
case-by-case basis, further its existence is purely a factual analysis made by the company's directors and
statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant
company on a stand-alone basis, although in certain circumstances, and subject to specific strict rules, the
interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. In particular, in
case of up-stream and cross-stream guarantees or security for the financial obligations of group companies,
examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany
loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to
shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether
and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of
interest. Generally, the risk assumed by an Italian guarantor or grantor of security must not be
disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it.

To this extent, customary "limitation language" is usually inserted in indentures (or other similar
agreements pursuant to which debt instruments (such as the Notes) are issued), credit agreements,
guarantees and/or security documents for the purpose of limiting the amount guaranteed and/or secured by
the guarantor to an amount that is proportionate for the direct or indirect economic benefit to the guarantor
derived from the transaction.

Absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the guarantee and security or the collateral ultra vires
and potentially affected by conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the
shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Thus, civil liabilities
may be imposed on the directors of the guarantor if it is assessed that they did not act in the best interest of
the guarantor and that the acts they carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the guarantor or


-----

were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the
imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising a control or power of
'direction and coordination' over the guarantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from
such improper control. Moreover, there could also be the risk, according to certain interpretations, that a
guarantee and security can be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed
to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interests of the guarantor.
More precisely, pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article 2475-ter of the Italian Civil Code, if a director of a
company which entered into one or more agreements pursuant to which that company granted a guarantee
or security interest had an interest conflicting with that of such guarantee or security provider, that company
may ask that the relevant documents pursuant to which such guarantee or security interests have been
granted to be voided (annullati), if such conflict of interest was (or ought to be) known by the other parties
to such documents. In addition, pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article 2391 of the Italian Civil Code, if the
resolution taken by the board of directors of a company approving the transactions contemplated by, and
the entering into by that company, the documents pursuant to which such guarantee or security interests are
granted has been taken with the decisive vote of a director having either a personal or third party's interest
or such interest has not been disclosed to the other directors and the statutory auditors of the company or
the resolution does not provide an appropriate explanation of the reasons that justify such transactions and
the corporate benefit deriving therefrom in favor of the relevant company, and provided that such resolution
can cause a damage to the company, the resolution may be challenged by the directors and statutory auditors
within 90 days from its date of approval. The resolution may be challenged also by the shareholders of the
company, if it is prejudicial to their rights (Article 2388, paragraph 4, of the Italian Civil Code).

The rules on corporate benefit apply equally to security provided by subsidiaries in relation to the financial
obligations of their parent or sister companies.

As to corporate authorizations, the granting of a guarantee or security by an Italian company must be
permitted by the applicable laws and by the articles of association (statuto) of the Italian company.

In addition, the granting of a security or a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability
which would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case
may be, of the Italian Civil Code, pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a
company to give financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to
support the acquisition or subscription by a third-party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity
that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness
originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of an Italian company's own shares or quotas or those
of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation of financial assistance provisions. Any
loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. Directors may
be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the company.

In order to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, inter alia, corporate benefit and financial
assistance, the maximum amount that the Italian Guarantor may be required to pay in respect of its
obligations as a Guarantor under the relevant guarantee and/or security interest and any other transaction
documents related thereto, will be subject to limitations. By virtue of these limitations, the relevant
guarantee and/or security interest will be significantly less than the amounts payable with respect to the
Notes, or that relevant Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under the relevant guarantee and/or
security interest.

In any case, as a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law with respect to, among others, financial
assistance and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the
guarantee and security interest provided by the Italian Guarantor will be limited. Accordingly, the holders
of the Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant guarantee and security.

In the light of the above, under the Indenture the guarantee or security provided by the Italian Guarantor
will be subject to certain restrictions or limitations, including, inter alia, the followings:

(1) the guarantee or security will not secure any amounts the purpose of which is to finance or refinance,
directly or indirectly, the acquisition of the Italian Guarantor and/or the subscription in any shares
or quotas in the Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect shareholder(s) or quotaholder(s))
and/or the payment of any fees, costs and expenses, stamp, registration or other taxes in connection
therewith;


-----

(2) the guarantee or security will be in any case limited to an amount equal to the aggregate of the
principal outstanding amount of any loan made available at any time to the Italian Guarantor (or
any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by the
Issuer and/or any Guarantor after the Issue Date;

(3) the guarantee will be limited to a specific maximum amount, pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian
Civil Code; and

(4) no Italian Guarantor shall be liable for any amount in excess of the amount that such Italian
Guarantor is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or
_surrogazione) arising as a result of the enforcement of the relevant guarantee._

The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and security shall be distributed amongst the guaranteed
and/or secured creditors (including, without limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the
provision of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes, as applicable, will be able
to recover limited amounts under the relevant guarantee or security.

**_"Virtual Tranching" Structure_**

Proceeds from a portion of the Notes notionally designated as "Tranche A" will be used to finance the
Acquisition and to refinance (directly or indirectly) existing indebtedness of the Target Group relating to
the previous acquisition, or subscription, of an Italian Guarantor's shares or quota (and/or those of a direct
or indirect parent of such Italian Guarantor) (collectively, the "acquisition debt") and proceeds from the
remaining portion of the Notes notionally designated as "Tranche B" will be used for purposes not relating
to the Acquisition and/or the acquisition debt. See "Use of Proceeds." Therefore, any Italian Guarantor
and/or Italian security provider will guarantee and/or secure (as applicable) only the Tranche B.

The abovementioned "virtual tranching" structure in respect of the Notes, which is aimed at identifying the
relevant portion of the Notes' proceeds that do not constitute "acquisition debt" in respect of an Italian
Guarantor and, therefore, does not fall within the prohibition under Italian financial assistance rules
(namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code), is untested in Italian courts and it
cannot be excluded that it might be deemed not sufficient to clearly distinguish and separate the nonacquisition portion of the Notes' proceeds from any portion of the Notes' proceeds to be utilized to support,
directly and/or indirectly, the acquisition or subscription by the Issuer of the share capital of an Italian
Guarantor, or any of its direct or indirect shareholder. Should the Note Guarantees and/or the security
interests granted by the Italian Guarantors, as applicable, be deemed by a court or public authority to be
contrary to any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable,
of the Italian Civil Code, such Note Guarantee and/or security interests could be declared null and void and
the Notes documents will provide that, if and to the extent such Note Guarantee and/or security interest
would result in a breach of any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474,
as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, applicable to the Italian Guarantors, each of the other Italian
Guarantors, as applicable, will be deemed to have no liability thereunder and the respective Note Guarantee
and/or security interest shall not be in force and effect.

In addition, the obligations of any Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider that becomes a
Guarantor and/or a security provider will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and will be subject
to the additional limitations set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement and/or in the applicable security
documents and/or guarantee agreement, in order for the applicable Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security
provider to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, among others, corporate benefit and
financial assistance.

**_Trust_**

There is no established concept of "trust" or "trustee" under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and
enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the holders of
the Notes under security interests on Italian assets is debatable under Italian law.

It is uncertain and untested in Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security can be created and
perfected in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) that are neither directly parties to the
relevant security documents nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and
corporate documents or public registries and, therefore, the risk of unenforceability by the holders of the


-----

Notes of the Italian security documents posed by Italian law cannot be eliminated or mitigated, with respect
to such holders of the Notes which are not directly parties to the relevant security documents nor are
specifically identified therein.

Due to the impossibility to clearly identify and keep track over time of the names of the individual holder
of the Notes, the Italian security, to the extent applicable, will be created in favor of the Security Agent
acting in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the
Italian Civil Code, of all secured creditors. It is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under
Italian law, a security interest can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of
the Notes) which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically
identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii)
in favor of a "trustee" since there is no established concept of "trust" or "trustee" under Italian law and the
precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a "trustee" as trustee under
security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law.

Given the above and considering that the holders of the Notes are not party to the Italian law-governed
security documents, there is a risk that an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes (in
relation to which the relevant perfection formalities acknowledging their status as a secured creditor are not
perfected at the time of enforcement) are not secured by the security interests created under the Italian lawgoverned security documents and/or cannot enforce that security interest.

To address the above potential issue, the collateral securing the Notes will be granted and perfected, to the
extent applicable, in favor of the Security Agent acting also in its capacity as legal representative
(mandatario con rappresentanza) of the holders of the Notes. In bond issuances made by Italian joint stock
companies (società per azioni), pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code
(introduced by Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), security interests can be validly created in favor of an
agent (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be authorized to enforce them on behalf
of the holders of the Notes. However, the provisions and the subject matter of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3,
of the Italian Civil Code are untested by Italian Courts and, therefore, even if the appointment of the
_rappresentante is upheld by an Italian Court, it cannot be excluded that an Italian Court may take a different_
view and interpretation and determine that, where the collateral is only granted in favor of the
_rappresentante, the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the collateral and/or_
cannot enforce that collateral, in particular as such Notes will issued by a non-Italian entity.

**_Certain Considerations in Relation to Security Interests_**

Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to
protect creditors against "undercapitalized companies" and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In this
respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company
or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject
to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a
company incorporated in Italy as a _società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other_
creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when,
taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower's
indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an
injection of equity and not a loan ("undercapitalization"). Pursuant to Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency
Code, any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a judicial
winding-up declaration are ineffective by operation of law. The new provision replaced Article 2467,
paragraph 1, of the Italian Civil Code, according to which such payments would be required to be returned
to the borrower. In addition to that, Article 292, paragraph 1, of the Italian Insolvency Code sets forth that
claims of entities exercising management and coordination powers _vis-à-vis_ the entities subject to such
powers and claims of the entities subject to such powers vis-à-vis the entities exercising them deriving from
loans granted after the filing of petitions resulting in the opening of judicial winding up of in the year before,
are subordinated.

The above rules apply to shareholders' loans "made in any form" and scholars generally conclude that such
provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company
by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions
summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also


-----

applies to companies incorporated as _società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the_
intercompany loans that are a società per azioni.

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts
may apply such provisions relating to Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer's relationship with
Italian subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that
the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations
towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or
note be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only
to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note
granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer's ability to meet
its payment obligations under the Notes.

Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans
or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any
Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interests granted
by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted.

**_Certain Limitations on Enforcement_**

The enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming, especially
in a liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the enforcement process in
comparison to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be familiar. The two primary
goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor's assets for
the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as
going concerns and by ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold.

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and
security interests could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy or judicial liquidation
receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback of (i) the Italian
Bankruptcy Law (if applicable ratione temporis) and/or (ii) the Italian Civil Code, the Italian Insolvency
Code and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor
during the suspect period. For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of
claw-back actions in an insolvency scenario, see "Judicial Liquidation" section above.

If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any
amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security
interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or
guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents.

Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by the Italian Guarantor apply and/or
there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders
could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor.

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general
may be subject to, among others, the following aspects:

- the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating
to or affecting the rights of creditors;

- an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the
availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Italian court;

- with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive),
each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer
to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of
Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code;

- claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of
Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze)
or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim;


-----

- pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations
(compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for
the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation
or fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable;

- where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter
in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such
opinion is based on reasonable grounds;

- the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may
be limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione
_necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to_
Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the
application of such legal concepts under Italian law;

- there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement
or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or
instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would
survive such judgment might not be held to do so;

- enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del
_diritto);_

- the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument
may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation
pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code;

- any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal,
invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in
order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the
interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties
following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code);

- an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for
the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian
Civil Code are satisfied;

- an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial
obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such
interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis;

- in case of bankruptcy (filed or pending before July 15, 2022) or a judicial liquidation, a receiver is
appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the court and creditors'
committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the
enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the
relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized
by the court or, in case of judicial liquidation, to have the pledged assets assigned at a fair market
value returning any excess to the judicial liquidation estate;

- the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in
which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls or, in the
absence of seizure/attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto) and
extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest
and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding
or bankruptcy/judicial liquidation proceedings;

- in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment
to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable
date (data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of
ensuring that a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the


-----

relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of
witnessing on the document;

- there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning
advance waivers or forfeitures;

- the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented
by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the
violation of mandatory provisions;

- penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court;

- any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian
company, which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including,
among others, any obligation to pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the
interest rate permitted under the Italian law no. 108 of March 7, 1996 (i.e., the Italian usury law),
as amended from time to time and related implementing rules and regulations; and (ii) any portion
of interest deriving from any compounding of interest which does not comply with Italian law,
including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued and unpaid interest
can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the event the
interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an agreement executed
after the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of
September 1, 1993 (the "Italian Banking Act") may not be enforceable;

- if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other
parties to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other
parties as a consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement;

- Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or
litigation;

- a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the secured creditor
from continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant
pledge; and

- in case of bankruptcy (to the extent applicable after July 15, 2022) or judicial liquidation of the
grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold
to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding or in case of a judicial
liquidation the pledged assets can also be assigned to secured creditors at a fair market value and,
as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the
pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on
the pledged quotas/shares.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action
can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters
into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to
seek a claw- back action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Articles 2901 and following of the
Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said
guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor's right
of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in
addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings:

- that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting
creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was
fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and

- that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if
the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated
in the fraudulent design.


-----

**_Maximum Guaranteed Amount_**

Under Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a personal guarantee is issued to guarantee conditional or
future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be
expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a
separate document, such as the Indenture). In addition, as mentioned above, the guarantees must be
supported by corporate benefit; in other words, the maximum guaranteed amount must be indicated in the
guarantee and shall not exceed the financial capabilities of the relevant guarantor. It has been held that such
determination must be proportionate to the relevant guarantor's assets. If such determination is deemed
disproportional to the assets of each of the guarantors, there is the risk that the guarantee could be declared
void.

In any event, pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, the maximum amount that an Italian
Guarantor and/or a subsidiary Guarantor may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as a guarantor
under its Guarantee will not exceed 130% of the aggregate amount of the Notes.

Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity
within the meaning of Article 106 of the Italian Banking Act, whose exercise is exclusively demanded to
banks and authorized financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking
Act may, inter alia, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian
Legislative Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking
Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or security by a company for the obligations of another company
which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby "group" includes
controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well
as companies, which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the rules described above,
subject to the Guarantor and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision
of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity.

**Grand Duchy of Luxembourg**

Pursuant to the entry into force on November 1, 2023 of the Luxembourg insolvency reform provided under
the Luxembourg law of 7 August 2023 on business continuity and the modernization of bankruptcy law
(the "LBCA"), the following reorganization proceedings or bankruptcy proceedings (together referred to
as "Luxembourg Insolvency Proceedings") may be opened against, or may be made available to, a
company incorporated or established in Luxembourg (the "Luxembourg Company") to the extent that the
relevant Luxembourg Company has its registered office and its central administration or, if the Recast EU
Insolvency Regulation applies, its "centre of main interests" (or an establishment) in Luxembourg (in case
of an establishment, in respect of secondary proceedings only and assuming that the "centre of main
interests" is located in a member state of the European Union other than Denmark and Luxembourg):

(a) bankruptcy proceedings (faillite) as provided for in the Luxembourg code of commerce;

(b) suspension of payment (sursis de paiement) as provided for in articles 593 and subsequent of the
Luxembourg code of commerce; and

(c) judicial reorganization proceedings (réorganisation judiciaire) as provided for in the LBCA.

The suspension of payment regime (sursis de paiement) was intended to be abolished by the LBCA
however, arguably due to a legislative error, this was not fully achieved. In light of the limited practical
relevance of this regime, it is not further described.

A debtor may also enter into negotiations with creditors (at least two creditors) with a view to reaching an
amicable agreement (accord amiable) pursuant to the LBCA. Once an amicable agreement has been
reached, the debtor may apply to the court to obtain a certification (homologation) of the amicable
agreement. The court will assess whether or not the purpose of the amicable agreement is to reorganise (all
or part of) the debtor's assets or activities to grant the certification which will render the amicable agreement
enforceable (exécutoire). The amicable agreement can only be disclosed to third parties if the debtor has
given its express consent. The liability of the creditors participating in an amicable agreement cannot be
pursued by the debtor, another creditor or by third parties for the sole reason that the agreement has not
effectively preserved the continuity of all or part of the debtor's business.


-----

The Luxembourg Company may also be subject to preventive measures with a view to detecting financial
difficulties of undertakings at an early stage and facilitating business preservation and reorganization
pursuant to the LBCA. In particular, the minister of the economy and the minister of middle classes are
tasked, within their respective competences, with detecting companies in financial difficulties.

A company which finds itself in financial difficulties may ask the relevant minister to appoint a business
conciliator from a list of experts in the field, to facilitate the reorganization of all or part of the assets of the
company or its activities. It can be appointed outside or, in the context of a judicial reorganization
procedure.

The role of the conciliator will be different than the role of the bankruptcy receiver during bankruptcy
proceedings. As such, the conciliator does not have any decision-making power over the company and his
main role will be to take part in negotiations to facilitate the reaching of agreements. The role of the
conciliator ends at the request of the debtor or by the conciliator itself.

A court appointed expert (mandataire de justice) may be appointed by the commercial district court in case
of gross and qualified failures (manquements graves et caractérisées) of the debtor or any of its corporate
bodies, which threaten the continuity of the business of the company and if the requested measure is
intended to preserve such continuity. The appointment will be made at the request of the public prosecutor
or any interested party (including the debtor).

In addition to these proceedings, the ability of creditors to receive payments due to them by a Luxembourg
Company incorporated or established in Luxembourg may be affected by a decision of the commercial
district court (Tribunal d'arrondissement siégeant en matière commerciale) putting the relevant
Luxembourg Company into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Although strictly speaking not an
insolvency proceeding, judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the State
Prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious breach or
violation of the Luxembourg code of commerce or of the Luxembourg act of 10 August 1915 on commercial
companies, as amended. The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar
rules as those applicable to Luxembourg bankruptcy proceedings.

In addition to these Luxembourg Insolvency Proceedings and although strictly speaking not an insolvency
proceeding, a Luxembourg Company may be subject to voluntary dissolution or liquidation (dissolution ou
_liquidation volontaire) and administrative dissolution without liquidation (dissolution administrative sans_
_liquidation)._

**_Bankruptcy (faillite)_**

General Administration of a Bankruptcy Proceeding

If a Luxembourg Company is in cessation of payments (cessation de paiements) and has lost its
creditworthiness (ébranlement du crédit), the court in the district in which the Luxembourg Company has
its principal place of business can (subject to exceptions) declare the company bankrupt either (a) upon an
express insolvency declaration of the insolvent company itself (aveu de faillite), (b) a court action
introduced by a creditor, (c) at the request of the public prosecutor or (d) ex officio (by virtue of its office)
by the court.

The managers of a Luxembourg Company have, in principle, the obligation to file for bankruptcy with the
court clerk of the district court of the company's registered office within one month when it ceases its
payments (i.e., it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due with normal means of payment), subject to any
judicial reorganization proceedings subsisting in which case the obligation to file the bankruptcy petition
is suspended, as from the date of the filing of the application for a judicial reorganization proceedings by
the Luxembourg Company, for the duration of the stay of execution (sursis) granted in accordance with the
LBCA. If the managers fail to comply with such obligation, they may be held (i) liable towards the relevant
Luxembourg Company or any third-parties for any loss suffered and (ii) criminally liable for simple
bankruptcy (banqueroute simple) in accordance with article 490 of the Luxembourg criminal code.

**_Effects of a Bankruptcy Proceeding_**

The immediate consequence of the opening of a bankruptcy proceeding is that the insolvent debtor (the
"failli") is deprived from the administration of its assets as from 00:00 on the date on which it is declared
in bankruptcy by the court (the retroactive effect is called the "zero hour rule"). The court appoints a


-----

bankruptcy receiver (curateur). The receiver will under the supervision of the court manage the bankruptcy
(which effectively means to liquidate its assets and pay off creditors) without having to consult with the
managers.

The main effect of bankruptcy proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the
Luxembourg Company, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for secured creditors, and the payment
of creditors in accordance with their rank upon the realisation of assets.

In principle, contracts of the bankrupt company are not automatically terminated on commencement of
bankruptcy proceedings, save for contracts for which the identity or solvency of the company was crucial
(intuitu personae agreements). However, certain contracts are terminated automatically by law (such as
employment contracts) unless expressly confirmed by the receiver. The receiver may choose to terminate
contracts of the company subject to the rule of "exceptio non adimpleti contractus" and the creditors'
interest. However, as of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will
accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate.

Unsecured claims will only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose
of such liquidation) and certain preferential debts. During bankruptcy proceedings, all enforcement
measures by unsecured creditors are suspended, save as provided for in the Luxembourg Act of 5 August
2005 on financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the "Luxembourg Collateral Act").

Save with respect to financial collateral arrangements falling within the scope of the Luxembourg Collateral
Act, Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the
Luxembourg Company s during the pre-bankruptcy hardening period (période suspecte) which is a period
of a maximum of six months preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy (and up to 10 days before the
beginning of such period for certain transactions and payments), except that in certain specific situations
the commercial district court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date. Fraudulent
transactions may be set aside without consideration of the date they have been entered into. In particular:

(a) pursuant to Article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, some transactions (in particular,
the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts (save with respect to financial collateral
arrangements falling within the scope of the Luxembourg Collateral Act)); the payment of debts
which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, setoff or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than
in cash or by bill of exchange (unless, arguably, that method of payment was agreed from
inception), transactions without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration
entered into during the suspect period (or the ten days preceding it)) must be set aside or declared
null and void, if so requested by the bankruptcy receiver. Article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of
Conduct does not apply to financial collateral arrangements such as Luxembourg law pledges over
shares, accounts or receivables and set-off arrangements falling within the scope of the
Luxembourg Collateral Act;

(b) pursuant to Article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured debts
as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the suspect period are subject to
cancellation or setting aside by the commercial district court upon proceedings initiated by the
bankruptcy receiver, if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt's cessation of
payments, Article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce does not apply for financial
collateral arrangements, such as Luxembourg law pledges over shares, accounts or receivables and
set-off arrangements falling within the scope of the Luxembourg Collateral Act;

(c) pursuant to Article 447 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, the bankruptcy receiver may
challenge and initiate nullity actions against mortgages and privileges that have been granted either
ten days prior to or after the date of the cessation of payments if more than 15 days have elapsed
between the granting of the mortgage or privilege and its registration. Article 447 of the
Luxembourg Code of Commerce does not apply to financial collateral arrangements, such as
Luxembourg law pledges over shares, accounts or receivables and set-off arrangements falling
within the scope of the Luxembourg Collateral Act; and

(d) Pursuant to Article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and Article 1167 of the
Luxembourg Civil Code (action paulienne), the bankruptcy receiver (acting on behalf of the


-----

creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the
granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit.

**Judicial reorganization proceedings (réorganisation judiciaire)**

**_General rules_**

Judicial reorganization proceedings are opened by decision of the district court sitting in commercial
matters ruling on the petition by the Luxembourg Company as soon as (i) its business is jeopardized (mise
_en peril de l'entreprise) in the short term (à bref délais) or in the longer term (à terme) and (ii)_ a writ
requesting the opening of such procedure has been filed.

The purpose of the judicial reorganization proceeding is to preserve, under the supervision of a judge, the
continuity of all or part of the assets or activities of a debtor. Judicial reorganization proceedings constitute
judicial proceedings aiming to avoid bankruptcy and preserve a Luxembourg Company's business.

The opening of judicial reorganization proceedings aims either:

(a) at obtaining a stay (sursis) to allow the conclusion of an amicable agreement (accord amiable);

(b) at carrying out a judicial reorganization by collective agreement (réorganisation judiciaire par
_accord collectif); or_

(c) at carrying out a judicial reorganization by transfer by court order to one or several third parties,
of all or part of the assets or the activities (réorganisation par transfert par décision de justice).

The application for a judicial reorganization procedure may pursue a separate objective for each activity or
any part of the business of the Luxembourg Company.

As soon as the application is filed by a Luxembourg Company, the presiding judge of the chamber of the
court appoints a delegated judge (juge délégué) to report to the court seized of the case on the admissibility
and the basis of the application based on the hearing of the Luxembourg Company, as well as any other
person considered useful to the investigation.

Within fifteen days of the filing of the application for judicial reorganization it must be examined by the
court and the debtor is summoned to a hearing.

After hearing the report of the delegated judge and if the opening conditions are met, the court delivers its
judgment within eight days of the hearing. The state of bankruptcy of the debtor does not prevent the
opening of the judicial reorganization proceedings if this is more advantageous than bankruptcy
proceedings. If the conditions seem to be fulfilled, the court will declare the opening of the judicial
reorganization procedure and will declare a stay on payment. It will determine the duration of the
stay/suspension of payments which cannot exceed four months. The duration may be extended but without
exceeding 12 months after the judgement opening the judicial reorganization procedure in case the request
is filed in the context of a transfer by decision of justice to one or several third parties, of all or part of the
assets or the activities. In exceptional circumstances (taking into account the size of the business and the
complexity of the matter or the importance of the jobs) and if the interests of the creditors allow so, the 12month period may be extended by another 6 months. The total duration of the stay may however not exceed
12 months as from the judgement ordering the stay.

Within fourteen days of its pronouncement, the Luxembourg Company Luxembourg Company must
individually notify the creditors of the opening judgment. Creditors may consult the list of creditors at the
court registry.

A legal representative (mandataire de justice) can be appointed to assist at the request of the debtor or any
third party having an interest in doing so. If a business conciliator was previously appointed, the court can
decide to terminate part or all of the mission of the business conciliator (conciliateur d'entreprise).

In case of gross and qualified failure of the debtor or one of its bodies, the court may appoint a temporary
administrator (administrateur provisoire) at the request of any interested party or the public prosecutor. If
a business conciliator was previously appointed, the court can decide to terminate part or all of the mission
of the business conciliator (conciliateur d'entreprise).


-----

**_Effects of judicial reorganization proceedings_**

The main effect of filing an application for the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings is to obtain
a suspension effect (as of the filing of the application) during which the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt
(except at its own initiative), be dissolved, or be the subject of an administrative dissolution proceedings
without liquidation. The obligation to declare bankruptcy is also suspended during this period.

During the duration of the stay, the creditors can no longer enforce their rights against the debtor in relation
to the "stayed" claims (créances sursitaires) and no attachment may be made. "Stayed" claims are claims
other than claims for the payment of salaries due before the judgment opening the judicial reorganization
procedure or due by reason of the filing of the writ for the opening of the judicial reorganization procedure
or the decisions taken in the context of the judicial reorganization procedure.

In addition, no realisation of any movable or immovable property of the debtor can take place following
the exercise of any enforcement measure (voies d'exécution) (subject to certain exceptions). However, this
shall not affect the realisation of financial collateral arrangements falling within the scope of the
Luxembourg Collateral Act and these will continue to be effective and enforceable (opposables) security
interests. The judicial reorganization measures do however impact the right to terminate certain contracts
to which the debtor is a party. In particular (a) the application for or the opening of a judicial reorganization
procedure will not cause the termination of ongoing contracts of the debtor, (b) any breach by the debtor of
its contractual obligations prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization measure permits other party to
terminate the agreement only if the debtor does remedy such default within 15 days of a demand to do so
and (c) a debtor, following the opening of a judicial reorganization procedure, may unilaterally suspend its
contractual obligations during the period of the suspension of payments if this is imperatively required for
the reorganization of its business and to notify the counterparty accordingly. In such an event, the
contractual counterparty can also suspend the performance of its obligations, but the decision of the debtor
does not permit the contractual counterparty to terminate the agreement. Whilst these provisions do not
impact the validity and the enforceability of any financial collateral agreements as such, there is a risk that,
if a court was to decide that they apply to financing agreements, they could impact the timing of an
enforcement of any financial collateral arrangements entered into by the debtor (in particular if their
enforcement requires an acceleration of the secured liabilities).

The stay does not prohibit voluntary payments by the Luxembourg Company of "stayed" claims, insofar as
this payment is necessary for the continuity of such Luxembourg Company's business.

Without prejudice to the application of the Luxembourg Collateral Act and in particular the rules on set-off
and netting provided therein, set-off between outstanding claims and claims arising during the suspension
is only permitted if these claims are related (créances connexes).

The stay does not, in principle, terminate on-going contracts or the terms and conditions of their
performance.

Penalty clauses, including interest rate surcharges, intended to cover potential damage suffered as a result
of non-compliance with a principal undertaking remain, in principle, ineffective during the stay and until
the full implementation of the reorganization plan, as far as the creditors included in the plan are concerned.
The creditor may, however, include the actual loss suffered as a result of non-compliance with the main
undertaking in its claim.

It will also be possible to modify, at the request of the debtor, the objective of the procedure at any time
during the period of the stay.

With respect to the LBCA, it is unclear to what extent the judicial reorganization proceedings will be used
and what the effects in practice will be on creditors (including secured creditors and landlords) and debtors.

**Specific rules**

**_Judicial reorganization by amicable agreement_**

In case the objective of the judicial reorganization procedure is the conclusion of an amicable agreement
(conclusion d'un accord amiable) with all of the creditors or with at least two or more creditors of the
debtor, the debtor will pursue such objective, if necessary, with the help of a legal representative


-----

(mandataire de justice). If a business conciliator was previously appointed, the court can decide to terminate
part or all of the mission of the business conciliator (conciliateur d'entreprise).

**Judicial reorganization by collective agreement (réorganisation judiciaire par accord collectif)**

The judicial reorganization by collective agreement of the creditors proceedings aims at obtaining an
agreement on a reorganization plan with all creditors, which is binding on creditors (including on dissenting
creditors subject to certain conditions), provided that certain conditions as to the proportion of creditors
accepting the plan and the amount of claims such creditors represent are met. The plan shall be approved
by the court provided that the conditions set out in the LBCA are met.

The debtor must inform the "stayed" creditors (créanciers sursitaires) within 14 days of the judgment
opening the judicial reorganization procedure, of the amount and nature of their debts, as well as the class
to which they belong (i.e., an ordinary "stayed" creditor or an extraordinary "stayed" creditor).

During the period of the stay, the debtor will have to draw up a reorganization plan which will then be
presented to its creditors and which has to contain a descriptive part and a prescriptive part. The legal
representative (mandataire de justice) (if one has been appointed) may assist the debtor in the preparation
of the plan.

The reorganization plan must contain steps on how creditors will be discharged (désintéressement des
_créanciers) and, where appropriate, restructuring measures. It must also, give a description of, amongst_
others, the assets and liabilities of the Luxembourg Company, the different categories of claims or interests
concerned by the plan and the classes into which the creditors have been allocated for the purpose of
adopting the plan as well as the value of each claim and interest in each class, the accounting and economic
situation of the Luxembourg Company, means of new financing anticipated and why such financing is
necessary and an explanatory statement explaining why the plan offers a reasonable prospect of avoiding
the Luxembourg Company's insolvency and guaranteeing its viability.

The reorganization plan must also describe the rights of all persons holding stayed claims (créances
_sursitaires) and the modification of their rights as a result of the vote and validation (homologation) of the_
reorganization plan. It shall also indicate the proposed payment terms and reductions (abattements) of
stayed claims in capital and interest. It shall also include a payment proposal in respect of all creditors.

Moreover, the reorganization plan may, without limitation also provide other matters such as:

(a) the conversion of claims into shares;

(b) waivers of interest or rescheduling of the payment of such interests;

(c) that the outstanding claims may not be offset against claims of the creditor (holder) subsequent to
the certification, except in the case of related claims (créances connexes) or claims which may be
offset under an agreement prior to the opening of the procedure;

(d) the suspension of the exercise of the existing rights of extraordinary outstanding creditors for a
period not exceeding twenty-four months from the date of the certification judgment, without
prejudice to the payment of interest which is contractually or legally due to them on their claims;

(e) provide for the voluntary transfer of all or part of the debtor or its activities.

The implementation period of the plan may not exceed five years from its certification. The debtor may
request to be assisted by a court officer (mandataire de justice) for the drafting of this plan.

The court clerk will communicate the day and time of the hearing at which the plan will be voted. This
communication will indicate that the creditors will be able to present their observations at the hearing either
in writing or orally and that only ordinary and extraordinary outstanding creditors whose rights are affected
by the plan will be able to vote.

The approval of the reorganization plan results from a favorable vote of (a) the majority of the creditors in
each class, (b) representing by their uncontested or provisionally admitted claims half of all the amounts
due in principal. The creditors and claims included in the list of creditors filed by the Luxembourg


-----

Company, as well as creditors whose claims have provisionally been admitted will be considered for
calculating the required majority.

The reorganization plan must be implemented within five years of its certification. The full implementation
(exécution) of the plan fully discharges the Luxembourg Company s for all the claims contained therein. If
the Luxembourg Company is manifestly no longer able to execute the plan and as a result thereof the
relevant creditor suffers prejudice therefrom, a creditor may request the revocation of the reorganization
plan. In case of bankruptcy adjudication of the Luxembourg Company the reorganization plan is
automatically terminated.

**_Judicial reorganization by transfer by court order_**

In the judicial reorganization by transfer by court order, a court officer (mandataire de justice) organizes
the transfer of all or part of the Luxembourg Company's assets or activities with a view to ensuring the
continuity of activities. The court may order the transfer of all or part of the business or its activities where
the Luxembourg Company consents to this in its petition for judicial reorganization or during the course of
the judicial reorganization proceedings. These transfers may be achieved by successive sales and/or
transfers or take the form of a merger.

The same transfers may be ordered at the request of the State Prosecutor or by summons from a creditor or
any person having an interest in acquiring all or part of the business:

(a) when the debtor fulfils the conditions for bankruptcy without having applied for the opening of
judicial reorganization proceedings;

(b) when the court rejects the application to open judicial reorganization proceedings, orders its early
termination or otherwise revokes the reorganization plan;

(c) when the creditors do not approve the reorganization plan; or

(d) when the court refuses to approve the reorganization plan.

The request for transfer may be made in the petition or summons to terminate the reorganization
proceedings early or to revoke the reorganization plan, or in a separate exploit against the debtor.

As soon as the application or summons is served, the court shall appoint a delegated judge (juge délégué)
to report to the court hearing the case on the basis of the application and on any other factor relevant to its
assessment.

The court will then also appoint a delegate judge (juge délégué) who will report to the court on the merits
of such request.

The judgment which provides for a transfer procedure will also appoint a legal representative (mandataire
_de justice) whose role it will be to organise the transfer of all or some of the company's assets in order to_
ensure the continuity of its business.

The legal representative (mandataire de justice) appointed by the court will be responsible to organize and
carry out the transfer of the assets or all or part of its activities. The court-ordered transfer is carried out by
the sale or transfer of the movable or immovable assets as necessary or useful to maintain all or part of the
Luxembourg Company's economic activity, or in the form of a merger in accordance with the Luxembourg
act of 10 August 1915 on commercial companies, as amended. The court must give its approval to the legal
representative before he can proceed with the transfer.

**Voluntary dissolution or liquidation (dissolution ou liquidation volontaire)**

The managers may decide to convene an extraordinary general meeting to decide on the dissolution of the
company and a liquidator is appointed during the extraordinary general meeting. If no liquidator has been
appointed, the persons in charge of the management of the company prior to its liquidation will be
considered as liquidators.


-----

_Administrative dissolution without liquidation (dissolution administrative sans liquidation)_

The administrative dissolution without liquidation has been introduced by the law of 28 October 2022 and
it allows to proceed with the administrative dissolution of a company without having to go through the
formal procedure of a full judicial liquidation. It allows "empty shells" (companies that no longer have any
reason to exist) to be disposed of in a short space of time. An administrative dissolution without liquidation
(dissolution administrative sans liquidation) is managed by the administrator of the RCS Luxembourg at
the request of the State Prosecutor against companies and shall only apply provided three cumulative
conditions are met: (a) the company must have no assets, (b) the company must have no employees and (c)
the company must pursue activities contrary to criminal law or which seriously contravene the provisions
of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce or the Luxembourg act of 10 August 1915 on commercial
companies, as amended (including the laws governing authorizations to do business).

**_Luxembourg Law Limitations Relating to Guarantees and Security Interests_**

_Effects of opening of Luxembourg Insolvency Proceedings on security interests governed by the_
_Luxembourg Collateral Act_

The Luxembourg Collateral Act provides for rules in respect of security interests over claims or financial
instruments securing monetary claims (or claims for the delivery of financial instruments).

Article 20 of the Luxembourg Collateral Act expressly provides that financial collateral arrangements
governed by or falling within the scope of the Luxembourg Collateral Act including enforcement measures
are valid and enforceable even if entered into during the hardening period, against third parties including
supervisors, receivers, liquidators and any other similar persons or bodies irrespective of any bankruptcy,
liquidation or other situation, national or foreign, of composition with creditors or reorganization affecting
any one of the parties (save in case of fraud).

Article 24 of the Luxembourg Collateral Act provides that foreign law security interests over claims or
financial instruments granted by a Luxembourg company will be valid and enforceable as a matter of
Luxembourg law notwithstanding any Luxembourg Insolvency Proceedings, if such foreign law security
interests are similar in nature to a Luxembourg security interest falling within the scope of the Luxembourg
Collateral Act and even if entered into during the hardening period (save in case of fraud).

Article 21(2) of the Luxembourg Collateral Act provides that where a financial collateral arrangement has
been entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization
measures or the entry into force of such measures, such arrangement is enforceable against third parties,
administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar organs if the collateral taker proves that
it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or
that it could not reasonably be aware of it.

_Limitation on enforcement of security interests_

According to Luxembourg conflict of laws rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex rei
_sitae or lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or security interest is_
situated) in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets. As a
consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security
interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in
Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/claims governed by
Luxembourg law and/or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg,
securities which are held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located
in Luxembourg, etc. If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests
over such assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in
accordance with Luxembourg law.

The Luxembourg Collateral Act governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over,
among others: (a) shares in private limited liability companies; (b) bank accounts; and (c) receivables
located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, granted to secure financial obligations. Under the
Luxembourg Collateral Act, the perfection of security interests depends on certain registration, notification
and acceptance requirements.


-----

Article 11 of the Luxembourg Collateral Act sets out enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence
of an enforcement event, including, but not limited to:

(a) appropriate the pledged assets or have the pledged assets appropriated by a third party at a price
determined before or after their appropriation by the agreed upon valuation method;

(b) selling or causing the sale of the pledged assets: (i) in a private transaction (vente de gré à gré) at
normal commercial terms (conditions commerciales normales); (ii) on a trading venue on which
the pledged assets are admitted to trading or (ii) by public auction;

(c) court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations
following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert;

(d) request the redemption of the pledged units or shares of an undertaking for collective investment
at the redemption price in accordance with the instruments of incorporation of this undertaking for
collective investment;

(e) exercise all the rights arising under the pledged insurance contract, including, in the case of a life
insurance contract or a capital redemption operation, the right to surrender, or request the insurance
undertaking to pay any sums due pursuant to the insurance contract or set-off between the secured
obligations and the pledged assets;

As the Luxembourg Collateral Act does not provide any specific time periods and depending on: (a) the
method chosen; (b) the valuation of the pledged assets; (c) any possible recourses; and (d) the possible need
to involve third parties, such as, for example, courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of
the security interests might be substantially delayed.

Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be
enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security
Interests/arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any
receivers/administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, even over assets
located outside of Luxembourg, in particular where a Luxembourg Company becomes subject to insolvency
proceedings in Luxembourg or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the
actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets.

The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to pledge agreements does not prevent any thirdparty creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security
interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such
creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the
beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale
(subject to preferred rights by operation of law).

While pledges over Luxembourg located accounts created under Luxembourg law governed account pledge
agreements are, in accordance with Article 20(1) of the Luxembourg Collateral Act, valid and binding
against third parties, administrators, bankruptcy receivers, liquidators and other similar officers
notwithstanding the existence of reorganization measures, liquidation proceedings or the occurrence of any
other similar situation of competition between creditors, national or foreign, there is a risk that such
protection does not apply to monies or other assets transferred to relevant accounts after the occurrence of
any Luxembourg Insolvency Proceedings. Therefore, there is a risk that monies or other assets transferred
to such account after the occurrence of Luxembourg Insolvency Proceedings may not effectively constitute
enforceable security assets under the relevant account pledge agreement.

Under Luxembourg law, certain creditors of an insolvent party have rights to preferred payments arising
by operation of law, some of which may, under certain circumstances, supersede the rights to payment of
secured or unsecured creditors, and most of which are undisclosed preferences (privilèges occultes). This
includes in particular the rights relating to fees and costs of the insolvency official as well as any legal costs,
the rights of employees to certain amounts of salary, and the rights of the Treasury and certain assimilated
parties (namely social security bodies), which preferences may extend to all or part of the assets of the
insolvent party. This general privilege takes in principle precedence over the privilege of a pledgee in
respect of pledged assets governed by the Luxembourg Collateral Act.


-----

**_Luxembourg third-party security interests and guarantee considerations_**

A Luxembourg company may only encumber its assets or provide guarantees in accordance with its
corporate objects (objet social) and for its corporate benefit (interêt social). In particular, according to
article 1500-11 of the Luxembourg Law on Commercial Companies, it is a criminal offence for managers
or directors of a company to use the assets or the credit of a company for a purpose which they know to be
against the interest of the company in their personal interest, or in the interest of companies in which they
are directly or indirectly interested. The granting of a guarantee or of a security interest in violation of
article 1500-11 of the Luxembourg Law on Commercial Companies would constitute a criminal offence
committed by the managers/directors of the company but there is also a risk that the guarantee/the security
interest could be considered to be null and void. A company may hence, in principle, not encumber its
assets or provide guarantees in favor of group companies in general (at least as far as parent companies and
fellow subsidiaries of its parent companies are concerned). In this respect it should be noted that there is no
Luxembourg legislation governing group companies which specifically regulates the establishment,
organization and liability of groups of companies. Consequently, the concept of group interest as opposed
to the interest of the individual corporate entity is not expressly recognised. However, based on relevant
French and Belgian case law and legal literature (to which Luxembourg courts are likely to refer in this
context), the view can be taken that a Luxembourg company may, in principle, validly assist other group
companies if:

(a) the transaction in the context of which the guarantee is granted is entered into with a view to
furthering economic, social or financial interests within the framework of a common policy
defined for the group as a whole;

(b) it can be established that the company derives a benefit from granting such financial commitments
or that at least, there is no disruption of the balance of interests in the group to the detriment of the
Luxembourg company; and

(c) the financial commitments is not in terms of the amounts involved disproportionate to the
company's financial means and the benefits derived from granting such assistance. If the assistance
is deemed contrary to the interest of the company by the courts, its directors may be held liable for
action taken in that context.

To mitigate the above risks, it is market practice in Luxembourg to limit personal guarantees, but not in
_rem_ security, granted by Luxembourg Company s to third parties to secure the obligations of parent
companies and fellow subsidiaries of their parent companies.

The question whether there is sufficient corporate benefit for a company to grant a guarantee is very fact
based and is to be assessed by the managers/directors of the relevant company. However, it is generally
considered that a guarantee provided for the obligations of a direct or indirect subsidiary, a so called
"downstream guarantee," does not raise any particular concern and is in the direct interest of the guarantor,
whereas a guarantee provided for the obligations of a direct or indirect parent or sister company, a so called
"upstream" or "cross-stream guarantee" respectively, are less likely to be in the direct interest of the
guarantor and therefore, such "upstream" or "cross-stream guarantee" are generally limited, such limitation
generally taking the form of a guarantee limitation language.

**_Registration in Luxembourg_**

The registration of the Notes, the Indenture and any other transaction documents (and any document in
connection therewith) with the _Administration de l'Enregistrement des Domaines et de la TVA in_
Luxembourg is required if the Notes, the Indenture and any other transaction documents (and any document
in connection therewith) are either (i) attached as an annex to an act (annexés à un acte) that itself is subject
to mandatory registration or (ii) deposited in the minutes of a notary (déposés au rang des minutes d'un
_notaire). In such cases, as well as in the case of a voluntary registration, the Notes, the Indenture and any_
other transaction documents (and any document in connection therewith) will be subject to registration
duties payable by the party registering, or being ordered to register, the Notes, the Indenture and any other
transaction documents (and any document in connection therewith).

Depending on the nature of the Notes, the Indenture and any other transaction documents (and any
document in connection therewith) such registration duties would be ad valorem (such as, for instance, a
registration duty of 0.24% calculated on the amounts mentioned in those agreements) or fixed (such as, for


-----

instance, a registration duty of €12 for a pledge or for the Notes). The Luxembourg courts or the official
Luxembourg authority may require (when these are presented before them) that the Notes, the Indenture
and any other transaction documents (and any document in connection therewith) and any judgment
obtained in a foreign court be translated into French or German.


-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions contained in the purchase agreement between the Issuer and the Initial
Purchasers, dated, 2023, (the "Purchase Agreement") the Issuer has agreed to sell to the
Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers severally have agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the entire
principal amount of the Notes. The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement,
including their agreement to purchase the Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. Subject to the
terms and conditions set out in the Purchase Agreement, the Initial Purchasers are obligated, severally and
not jointly, to purchase all of the Notes under the Purchase Agreement if any of the Notes are purchased.
In the event that an Initial Purchaser fails or refuses to purchase the Notes which it has agreed to purchase,
the Purchase Agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the other Initial Purchasers may be
increased or that the Purchase Agreement may be terminated.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by
counsel.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they propose to offer the Notes initially at the offering price
listed on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering, the Initial Purchasers may
change the offering price and any other selling terms of the Notes at any time without notice. The Initial
Purchasers and their respective affiliates reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors
and to reject orders in whole or in part. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain
of their affiliates or through registered broker dealers. If a jurisdiction requires that the offering be made by
a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers is a licensed
broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the Offering shall be deemed to be made by the Initial Purchasers or
such affiliate on behalf the Issuer in such jurisdiction.

To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker dealer intends to effect any sales
of Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker dealer affiliates as
permitted by guidelines promulgated by the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price
set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection
with this Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. The Issuer has also agreed to
indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect
of those liabilities.

We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the
purchase agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries that are
substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and
including the date falling 45 days after the closing of the Offering without the prior written consent provided
for in the Purchase Agreement.

**General**

**_New Issue of Notes_**

The Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. Application is expected to be
made to list the Notes on the Official List and for permission to be granted to deal in the Notes on the
Official List. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Notes on the Official List will be
approved or that permission to deal in the Notes thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Notes is not
conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission. Certain of the Initial Purchasers have advised us that
they presently intend to make a market in the Notes after completion of this Offering. However, the Initial
Purchasers are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time
without notice. In addition, any such market- making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will


-----

develop, or that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular
time or at a price which will be favorable to you, if at all.

**_Price Stabilization and Short Positions_**

In connection with this Offering, the Stabilizing Manager (or persons acting on its behalf) may purchase
and sell Notes in the open market. These transactions may include over-allotment, stabilizing transactions,
syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering
size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to
purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the
Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the
distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers
to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the Notes originally sold by such broker/dealer
are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These transactions may be
effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result, the
price of the Notes may be higher than the prices that otherwise might exist in the open market. Neither we
nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any
effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In addition, there is no
obligation on the Stabilizing Manager to engage in such transactions and neither we nor the Initial
Purchasers make any representation that the Stabilizing Manager will engage in these transactions or that
these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. Any stabilization action may
begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of this Offering is made and, if
begun, may be discontinued at any time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue
Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. Any stabilization action or over-allotment
must be conducted by the relevant Stabilizing Manager (or persons acting on its behalf) in accordance with
all applicable laws and rules.

**_Initial Settlement_**

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made on or about the Issue Date, which will
be      business days following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to
as "T+     "). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are
required to settle in two business days (until the end of the period of transition to a settlement cycle of T+1
on May 28, 2024), unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers
who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next      succeeding business days will be
required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement.
Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing should consult their own adviser.

**_Other Relationships_**

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities,
which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advising, investment
management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers or
their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past, are currently providing and may
provide in the future investment banking, financial advisory, corporate finance and commercial banking
services to the Sponsor, the Issuer, the Target or their respective affiliates in the ordinary course of business
for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions and other incentives,
including in connection with the Acquisition. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities,
the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade
debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans)
for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities
may involve securities and/or instruments of the Target, the Issuer or their respective affiliates. The Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates will receive allocations of the Notes (subject to customary closing
conditions), which could affect future trading of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their respective
affiliates may, in the future, act as hedge counterparties to the Issuer or the Target consistent with their
customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge
such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or
the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such short positions could
adversely affect future trading prices of Notes.


-----

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or
express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have received, and expect to receive, customary fees and
commissions in connection with the Transactions. In addition, all of the Initial Purchasers or their respective
affiliates will be lenders and/or agents under our New Term Loan B and our New Revolving Credit Facility
and have entered into commitment documents as lenders to provide financing for the Acquisition in the
event the Offering is not consummated and will receive customary fees for their services in such capacities.

In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lead arrangers and/or facility
agent under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and/or the Existing Term Loan A and will be repaid in
full with a portion of the proceeds of the Notes.


-----

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, sale, resale, pledge or other transfer of_
_the Notes offered hereby._

The Notes and the Note Guarantees, including any future Guarantees entered into from time to time
(together, the "Securities") have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or the
securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction, and, therefore unless so registered,
may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable securities laws of such state or other
jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Issuer is offering and selling the Securities to the Initial Purchasers for reoffer and resale only:

- in the United States, to "qualified institutional buyers," commonly referred to as "QIBs," as defined
in Rule 144A in compliance with Rule 144A ("QIBs"); and

- outside the United States, in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S, and only to
investors who:

    - if in a member state of the EEA, are not a retail investor, where "retail investor" means a
person who is one (or more) of the following: (a) retail client as defined in point (11) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (b) a customer within the meaning the Insurance Distribution
Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in
point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (c) not a qualified investor as defined in Article
2 of the Prospectus Regulation; and

    - if in the United Kingdom, are not a retail investor where "retail investor" means a person
who is one (or more) of: (a) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation
(EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (b) a
customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations
made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1)
of UK MiFIR; or (c) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus
Regulation.

We use the terms "offshore transaction" and "United States" with the meanings given to them in
Regulation S.

Each purchaser of Securities, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented
to and agreed with the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Securities are being offered for resale in a transaction not
involving a public offering in the United States within the meaning of the Securities Act, that the
Securities have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and, unless so
registered, may not be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred, except in compliance with
the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws pursuant
to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and in each case in compliance
with the conditions for transfer set out in paragraphs (5) and (6) below.

(2) It is neither the Issuer's "affiliate" (as defined in Rule 144 of the Securities Act), nor acting on its
behalf and that either:

(a) it is a QIB, within the meaning of Rule 144A and is aware that any sale of the Securities
to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A, and such acquisition of Securities will be for
its own account or for the account of another QIB; or

information from, the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers.

(5) It is purchasing the Securities for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which
it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer

A purchaser of Securities will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply
to holders of beneficial interests in these Securities as well as to holders of these Securities.

(9) It understands that the issuance of Additional Notes under the Indenture may have the effect of
extending the Resale Restriction Termination Date.

(10) It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Securities notice of any restrictions
on the transfer of such Securities.

(11) It acknowledges that the Transfer Agent or the Registrar will not be required to accept for
registration or transfer any Securities acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence
satisfactory to the Issuer, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar that the restrictions set out therein
have been complied with.

(12) It understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by the
Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Securities or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating

Consequently, any transfer of the Securities will be subject to the selling restrictions set out under
"Plan of Distribution" and "Important Information."

Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring any Securities as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor
accounts, the purchaser represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such
investor account and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements,
representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor account.

(14)

(a) If resident in a Member State of the EEA, it is not a "retail investor." For the purposes of this
paragraph, the expression "retail investor" means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

(i) a "retail client" as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II;

(ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1)
of MiFID II; or

(iii) not a "qualified investor" as defined in the Prospectus Regulation.

(b) If resident in the United Kingdom, it is not a retail investor. For purposes of this paragraph, a "retail

(b) no key information document required by the EU PRIIPs Regulation or the UK PRIIPs Regulation
for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer of the Notes is organized under the law of Luxembourg and the Guarantors are organized under
the laws of Austria, Belgium, England and Wales, France, Germany and Italy. Each of the Security
Documents relating to the Collateral will be governed by the laws of England and Wales, France, Germany
and Luxembourg, as applicable. The Indenture (including the Note Guarantees) is, and the Notes will be,
governed by New York law. All of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and each of the
Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Since substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and each
of the Guarantors, and their directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States, any
judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or a Guarantor or any such other person, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any
judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may
not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer and each of the Guarantors will
appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York
courts, in each case, in connection with any action in relation to the Notes and the Indenture or under U.S.
securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on us or on such other
persons as mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon the
civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer, investors will need to enforce such judgment in
jurisdictions where the Issuer has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside
the United States is described below for the country in which the Issuer is located, you should consult with
your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or
elsewhere outside the United States.

**Austria**

According to the Austrian Enforcement Act (Exekutionsordnung, EO), foreign judgments are only
enforceable if the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments is warranted by a bilateral or
multilateral treaty between the countries involved or by an ordinance (Verordnung) of the Austrian
government (in which the Austrian government confirms the reciprocal recognition). The Republic of
Austria and the United States currently do not have a treaty that provides for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments rendered in either country's courts, other than arbitration awards in civil and
commercial matters. There is currently also no applicable ordinance of the Austrian government in place.
As a consequence, a judgment obtained in a court of the United States, be it a judgment rendered by a U.S.
federal or state court, will not be recognized and enforced in Austria and, for purposes of enforcement in
Austria, would have to be re-litigated in Austrian courts in accordance with applicable Austrian civil
procedure laws (Zivilprozessverfahren, ZPO). Enforcement procedures under the Austrian Enforcement
Act can only be initiated once a final judgment has been obtained in an Austrian court. The Austrian rules
of civil procedure materially differ from those applicable in the United States (including with respect to,
but not limited to, court fees dependent on the amounts claimed and payable upon the filing of a claim, or
compensation of the prevailing party's attorney's fees, no discovery procedure).

**Belgium**

In the absence of any applicable bilateral or multilateral treaty between the United States and Belgium on
the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, a final and enforceable judgment rendered by any
federal or state court in the United States will not automatically be recognized or enforceable in Belgium.

In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Belgium, formal exequatur proceedings must first be initiated
before a court of competent jurisdiction in Belgium. In such an action, Belgian procedural rules will apply
and the Belgian court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the
U.S. court (subject to what is said below).

However, under Articles 22 to 25 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law (Wetboek van
_Internationaal Privaatrecht/Code de Droit International Privé), recognition and enforcement of foreign_
judgments can be refused in the following circumstances:

- the rights of defense have not been observed;


-----

- the recognition or enforcement in Belgium would be manifestly incompatible with Belgian public
policy (such incompatibility being assessed by taking into account, inter alia, the intensity of the
connection of the situation with the Belgian legal order and the gravity of the effect produced);

- the decision is not final and may still be appealed under the applicable foreign law; it is debated
whether a foreign judgment which has been declared provisionally enforceable in the State of
origin may, despite being appealable in that State, be enforced in Belgium under Article 23, §4 of
the Belgian Code of Private International Law;

- the judgment was obtained for the sole purpose of avoiding the application of the law which would
have been designated on the basis of the Belgian Code of Private International Law (if Belgian
courts had ruled on the case), and in a matter in which parties may not deviate from mandatory
rules under such applicable law;

- the claim was filed in the foreign courts after the filing in Belgium of a claim that is still pending
between the same parties with respect to the same subject matter;

- the judgment is incompatible with a decision rendered in Belgium or a prior judgment rendered in
another jurisdiction that is susceptible of being recognized in Belgium;

- Belgian courts had exclusive jurisdictions in respect of that matter;

- the competence of the foreign courts was solely based on the presence in the foreign state of the
defendant or of assets with no direct connection with the dispute; or

- the decision is in conflict with Belgian rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions
in relation to insolvency proceedings, intellectual property or corporate standing.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Belgium judgments in civil and commercial
matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts.

Note that the Belgian Code of Private International Law contains specific rules for the enforcement of
judgements that relate to insolvency matters.

**England and Wales**

The United States and the United Kingdom currently do not have a treaty between them providing for the
reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and
commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in
the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws,
would not automatically be recognized or directly enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce
any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, fresh proceedings must first be initiated before a court of
competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, an English court would not generally
reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and
it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (summary judgment is a
procedure by which the English court can dispose of all or part of a claim without proceeding to trial).
Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon
(among other things) the following:

- the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts
of laws principles and rules of English private international law (in other words, whether the U.S.
court had jurisdiction according to the rules of English private international law) at the time when
the original proceedings were initiated;

- the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause, or in
breach of an agreement for the settlement of disputes under which the dispute in question was to
be settled otherwise than by proceedings in a U.S. court (except with the agreement of the relevant
parties or the relevant parties' subsequent submission to the jurisdiction of the court);

- the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and
unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money;


-----

- the recognition or enforcement of the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy, the
European Convention on Human Rights or English law including the Human Rights Act 1998 (or
any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the extent applicable);

- the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature,
or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English penal,
revenue or other public law;

- the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum
assessed as compensation for the loss or damage sustained, and not being otherwise in breach of
the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

- the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural
justice;

- there not having been a prior inconsistent, determinative or conflicting judgment of an English
court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties, and/or prior inconsistent judgment
given by any other court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England and Wales;

- the U.S. judgment not having been wholly satisfied, or not being enforceable by execution solely
in the United States;

- the party seeking enforcement providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English court;
and

- the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date the U.S.
judgment became enforceable.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure
you that those judgments will be recognized and/or enforceable in England and Wales. In addition, it is
questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings
were commenced in England and Wales in an original action in respect of a U.S. judgment predicated solely
upon U.S. federal securities laws or other laws.

Further, it may not be possible to obtain a judgment in England and Wales or to enforce the judgment if the
judgment debtor is or becomes subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, if the judgment debtor has
any set off or counterclaim against the judgment creditor, or if an appeal is pending or anticipated against
the judgment or against the foreign judgment. Finally, note that, in any proceedings in England and Wales
to enforce a U.S. judgment, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought
if the action had been originally brought in England and Wales, unless the subject of the counterclaim was
in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.

**France**

The Group's counsel advised that the United States and France are not party to a treaty providing for
reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and
commercial matters. Accordingly, final and enforceable judgments rendered by U.S. courts based on civil
liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, enforceable in the
United States, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such
judgement was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant
civil court (Tribunal judiciaire). Under prevailing French case law, enforcement in France of such U.S.
judgement could be obtained following proper (i.e., non-ex parte) proceedings, if the French civil court is
satisfied that the following formal conditions have been met (which conditions do not include a review by
the French courts of the merits of the foreign judgement):

  - Such U.S. judgement is enforceable in the jurisdiction of the court which rendered it;

  - Such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the
dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court, the choice of the U.S. court is not
fraudulent and French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction to hear the matter;


-----

  - Such U.S. judgement does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining
to the merits and the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and

  - Such U.S. judgement is not tainted with fraud.

The French civil court would also verify that the U.S. judgement does not conflict with a French judgment
or a foreign judgment which is vested with res judicata and enforceable in France and there is no risk of
conflict with proceedings before French courts at the time enforcement of the judgement is sought (in this
latter case, exequatur proceedings may be stayed).

The French civil court's assessment of these conditions is discretionary. If any of these conditions is not
fulfilled, the U.S. judgment cannot be recognized or enforced in France.

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the
_res judicata in France as of the date of the decision of the French civil court (or exceptionally of the date_
of the U.S. judgment if it requires so to be effective). Please note that the decision granting exequatur may
be appealed.

As a general principle, procedural rules are governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the court (lex fori).

The party initiating exequatur in relation to a U.S. judgement in France would have to provide the French
civil court: (i) a certified copy of the U.S. judgement, as well as a French translation thereof, and (ii) any
document demonstrating that, according to the applicable U.S. law, the judgement is enforceable and has
been notified to the defendant.

Upon ruling on the exequatur request, the French civil court is also competent to rule on court costs and
fees. The party requesting the enforcement usually bears the costs of the exequatur proceedings.

The party requesting exequatur who benefited from legal aid in the U.S. proceedings on the merits does not
automatically benefit from such aid in front of the French civil court. However, this does not prohibit the
party seeking exequatur from requesting legal aid under the applicable French law (i.e., law n° 91-647 of
July 10, 1991 relating to legal aid).

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under
certain circumstances by French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80-538
of July 16, 1980 relating to the communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial,
industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities (loi de blocage), French Order No. 2000-916
of September 19, 2000 (adapting the value in euros of certain amounts expressed in francs in legislative
texts), decree No. 2022-207 of February 18, 2022 and bylaw of the Ministry of Economy of March 7, 2022
(relating to communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial
or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons) as well as French law No. 2018-670 related to the
protection of trade secrets, which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French
persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the
U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of
Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons.

Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78 17 of 6 January 1978 on data processing, data files and
individual liberties, as modified, as well as Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of
the Council of 27 April 2016) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information
in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery
context.

Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law
designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern
their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene (i) French
international public policy or (ii) overriding mandatory rules (as determined on a case by case basis by
French courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities
laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought.

Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can
sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted


-----

by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with a French person.
Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before
French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a
foreign country with the foreign claimant. For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as
meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear
before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts'
jurisdiction over French nationals is no longer mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced
before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is
not fraudulent. It also rules that these provisions are not a matter of public order and must, in order to be
applicable in a specific matter, be raised by the claimant. In addition, a French national may waive its rights
to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by a jurisdiction
provision in a contract or by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court.

It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of December 12, 2012, as regards legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges
granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked
against a person domiciled in an EU Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU)
No. 1215/2012, the privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant
domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant's nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant
domiciled outside the European Union.

Moreover, several decisions of the civil chamber of the French High Court (Cour de cassation) dated
September 26, 2012, March 25, 2015 and October 7, 2015, February 7, 2018, October 3, 2018 and July 11,
2019 permit to conclude – despite a contrary decision of the commercial chamber of the French High Court
(chambre commerciale de la Cour de Cassation) issued on May 11, 2017 – that contractual provisions
submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party an additional option
to choose another jurisdiction (one-sided jurisdiction clauses) may only be effective if they set out an
objective basis for the alternative jurisdictions that one party could choose. Accordingly, any one-sided
jurisdiction clauses which do not set out an objective basis (as a reference to a ground of jurisdiction or to
legal rules) in any relevant documents would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts. These
decisions were issued on the basis of the Brussels I and I recast Regulations or on the basis of the
Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters signed in
Lugano on October 30, 2007 and have yet to be confirmed in cases that fall outside this scope.

**Germany**

There is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on federal or state securities
laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgement obtained in
U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have
a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgements, other than arbitration
awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgement for payment given by any federal
or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities
laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgement by a U.S. court, however,
may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in
accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung).
In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided
by a U.S. court, except as noted below.

German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgements if any of the reasons for
excluding enforceability set forth in Sections 723(2), 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure
(Zivilprozessordnung) exist:

  - if the judgment is not final under U.S. law

  - if, pursuant to German law, the courts in the country of the court having rendered the foreign
judgement did not have jurisdiction;

  - if process has not been duly served or has not been served in a timely fashion to permit a defense,
provided that the defendant did not actively participate in such process and pleads accordingly;


-----

  - if the judgement is incompatible with a prior judgement rendered by a German court or by a foreign
court which is to be recognized in Germany;

  - if the proceeding resulting in the judgement to be recognized is incompatible with a previously
pending (rechtshängig) proceeding in Germany;

  - if a recognition of the judgement would be obviously incompatible with fundamental principles of
German law (ordre public), in particular, if the recognition would be incompatible with the civil
rights under the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and if reciprocity is not ensured (i.e., the
courts of the country where the judgement was issued would not recognize and enforce a
comparable judgement by a German court in equivalent circumstances).

Subject to the foregoing, holders of the Notes may be able to enforce judgements in civil and commercial
matters obtained from U.S. courts in Germany. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce
judgements in Germany will be successful. In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive
damages are usually denied by German courts as incompatible with the substantial foundations of German
law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize
damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Consequently,
judgements awarding monetary damages under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws
may not be enforceable to the extent they provide for a compensation that would qualify as being of a penal
or punitive nature.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In so far as
the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on
common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to
trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and/or the deposition of witnesses.
Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial
discovery process exists under German law.

If the party in whose favor the final U.S. federal or state judgement is rendered brings a new lawsuit in the
same matter in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German courts the final
judgement rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgement by a U.S. federal or state
court will be regarded by the German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such
judgement relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgement that is
not in line with the judgement rendered by the U.S. federal or state court, but the latitude to deviate from
the foreign judgment is limited. The German court is free to issue a completely new decision if there are
grounds for non-recognition under 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure, but must otherwise take
the foreign decision into account (i.e., the foreign judgement has a certain binding effect).

Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
liquidation or moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting rights of creditors generally.

**Italy**

The United States and Italy currently do not have a bilateral treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.

Notwithstanding the above, recognition and enforcement in Italy of a final judgment for payment rendered
by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely
upon U.S. federal securities laws, does not require re-examination of the merit of the case and will be
enforceable in Italy, provided that, pursuant to Article 64 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995, among
others, the following conditions are met:

(a) the U.S. court which rendered the final judgment had jurisdiction upon the relevant matter
according to Italian law principles of jurisdiction;

(b) the relevant summons and complaint were appropriately served on the defendants in accordance
with U.S. law and during the proceedings the essential rights of defense of the defendants have not
been violated;

(c) the judgment is final and not subject to any further appeal in accordance with U.S. law;


-----

(d) the parties to the proceeding appeared before the court in accordance with U.S. law or, in the event
of default by the defendants, the U.S. court declared such default in accordance with U.S. law;

(e) the U.S. judgment is not in conflict with any final judgment previously rendered by an Italian court;

(f) there is no action pending in the Republic of Italy among the same parties and on the same claim
which commenced prior to the action in the United States; and

(g) the provisions of such judgment would not violate Italian public policy.

In addition, pursuant to Article 67 of Italian law No. 218 of May 31, 1995, in cases of non-compliance with
or objection to the recognition of a U.S. judgment, or when it is necessary to proceed with forceful
execution, any interested person may apply to the Court of Appeal of the location of implementation for a
determination of the existence of the recognition prerequisites above. The U.S. judgment, jointly with the
decision allowing the application referred to above, constitutes entitlement to the implementation and
forceful execution. If the objection to the U.S. judgment is raised in the context of other proceedings
pending in Italy, the decision on the objection is made by the Italian judge with effects limited to those
proceedings only.

If an original action is brought before an Italian court in order to enforce the rights arising from the Notes
and/or the Indenture, the Italian court may refuse to apply U.S. law provisions or to grant some of the
remedies sought pursuant to U.S. law (e.g., punitive damages) if their application violates Italian public
policy and mandatory provisions of Italian law. Moreover, in original actions brought before Italian courts,
there is doubt as to the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based solely on the U.S. federal securities
laws. In addition, in original actions brought before Italian courts, Italian courts may apply not only Italian
rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of Italian law that are regarded as mandatory.

**Grand Duchy of Luxembourg**

**_Enforcement of Judgments_**

As there is currently no treaty in force governing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments
in civil and commercial matters between the United States and Luxembourg, courts in Luxembourg will
not automatically recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court.

A valid final, non-appealable and conclusive judgment against an issuer or a guarantor incorporated in
Luxembourg with respect to the guarantee of the Notes or guarantee thereof obtained from a court of
competent jurisdiction in the United States would be recognized and enforced by the courts of Luxembourg
in accordance with general provisions of Luxembourg procedural law. Pursuant to such rules, a foreign law
judgment would not be directly enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who obtains a valid, nonappealable and conclusive U.S. law judgment may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg
(exequatur), by requesting the enforcement of such U.S. law judgment from the District Court (Tribunal
_d'Arrondissement), pursuant to Section 678 of the Luxembourg New Code of Civil Procedure (Nouveau_
_Code de Procédure Civile). The District Court will authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg of the U.S._
law judgment without re-examination of the merits, if it is satisfied that the following conditions are met:

- the judgment rendered by the U.S. court is enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States;

- the assumption of personal and subject-matter jurisdiction (compétence) of the U.S. court and the
choice of venue is founded according to both such U.S. court's law and Luxembourg private
international law rules;

- the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural rules and has applied to the dispute
the substantive law which would have been applied by Luxembourg courts;

- the principles of fair trial and due process have been complied with and in particular the judgment
was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity to appear, and if
appeared, to present its case; and

- the judgment rendered by the U.S. court does not contravene Luxembourg public policy and has
not been obtained fraudulently.


-----

If an original action is brought in Luxembourg, without prejudice to specific conflict of law rules,
Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of such foreign law was not
made in good faith (bona fide), or (ii) if the foreign law was not pleaded and proved, or (iii) if pleaded and
proved, such foreign law was contrary to mandatory Luxembourg laws or incompatible with Luxembourg
public policy rules.

In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts
may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an exequatur may be refused in respect
of a foreign judgment granting punitive damages.

Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary
obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have power
to give a judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than euro. However, enforcement of the
judgment against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in euro and for such purposes all claims
or debts would be converted into euro.

Luxembourg case law is constantly evolving. Some of the above conditions of admissibility may change
and additional conditions could be required to be fulfilled by Luxembourg courts while other conditions
may not be required by Luxembourg courts in the future.

SYNLAB AG

#### 1. Reporting entity

The condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared by SYNLAB Aktiengesellschaft (hereinafter: “AG” or
“the Company”), the ultimate parent company of the SYNLAB Group. The Group’s condensed consolidated interim
financial statements as at and for the period ended 30 September 2023 consolidate the Company and its subsidiaries
(together referred to as the “Group” and individually as “Group entities”) and include the Group’s interest in associates.

The SYNLAB Group is Europe’s largest private supplier of medical diagnostic services, focusing primarily on clinical
diagnostics testing and screening services. The Group, which is based in Germany, employs over 27,000 people and
benefits from a network spanning 33 countries world wide. The Group is currently active in Austria, Belarus, Belgium,
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,
Ghana, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Mexico, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Panama, Peru, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia,
Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, U.A.E. and the United Kingdom. The address of SYNLAB AG is Moosacher Strasse
88, 80809 Munich, Germany.

SYNLAB AG

#### 2. Basis of preparation

Due to rounding, numbers presented throughout this and other documents may not add up precisely to the totals
provided and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.

**2.1 Significant accounting policies**
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements relate to SYNLAB AG, Munich, Germany (commercial
register number HRB 246540), and its subsidiaries. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted by the European Union (EU). The condensed consolidated
interim financial statements comply with IFRS as SYNLAB prepares and publishes the consolidated financial
statements in Euro (€).

The accounting policies used for preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements are consistent
with those applied in preparing the Group’s annual consolidated financial statements of SYNLAB AG for the financial
year from 1 January to 31 December 2022. As at 30 September 2023 the following amendments apply for the first time
in 2023, but do not have an impact on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group:

    - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts

    - Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting Policies

    - Amendments to IAS 8: Definition of Accounting Estimates

**2.2 Details specific to the preparation of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements**

2.2.1 Seasonality of operations

Revenue, operating profit before acquisition and restructuring expenses and all operating indicators are subject to
seasonal fluctuations due to vacation periods and the related impact on activity in certain laboratories as well as to the
impact of severe weather conditions, if any, during the winter period.

Consequently, the interim results for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2023 are not necessarily
representative of those that may be expected for the full-year 2023.

2.2.2 Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements in conformity with IAS 34 requires
management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim
condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses. The significant areas
of judgements and estimates are:

- Basis of consolidation

- Right-of-use assets

- Revenue recognition

- Intangible assets

- Restructuring and litigations

- Deferred tax

- Goodwill including contingent consideration payable and fair value adjustments.


-----

SYNLAB AG

Estimates and judgments for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2023 have been applied on the same basis
as in preparing the Group’s annual consolidated financial statements of SYNLAB AG for the financial year 2022 unless
otherwise noted.

**2.3 Functional and presentation currency**
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in Euro, which is the Company’s functional
currency. All financial information presented in Euro has been rounded to the nearest thousand.

**2.4 Going concern**

The Management Board considered the going concern basis to be appropriate following their assessment of the
Group’s financial position and its ability to meet its obligations as and when they fall due. In making the going concern
assessment the Management Board considered the following:

- the principal risks facing the Group and its systems of risk management and internal control;

- the current capital structure and liquidity of the Group; and

- the cash flow forecasts for 2023 and 2024.

Based on those factors, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

**2.5 Russia-Ukraine war**
In the context of the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the Group’s activities are not significantly affected.
SYNLAB has no exposure to Russia and very limited exposure to Belarus. The activities in Ukraine were sold during
Q3 2023. SYNLAB is, however, impacted by the inflationary pressure on energy prices and the indirect pressure on
salaries resulting from the crisis and from inflation in general .

**3 Significant events**

**3.1 Changes in the scope of consolidation**

On 1 July 2023 the Group sold all Swiss group entities for further information we refer to section 3.5 disposal group.

On 1 / 2 August 2023 the Group sold the Polish Synlab Polska Sp. z.o.o. and the Ukrainian Limited Liability
Company SYNLAB-UKRAINE entity for strategic purposes. The portion of that gain attributable to measuring any
investment retained in the former subsidiaries at their fair values at the date when control is lost was 2.1 M€. In the
condensed consolidated interim statement of profit and loss, the profit is shown under line “profit on disposal of
investment”. For this transaction, we received a cash inflow of 4.2 M€ and show the amount in the cash flow line
"Sale of subsidiaries, net of cash disposed and changes in debt".

As of 29 September 2023, the Group sold its veterinary business in Belgium, Germany, and Spain for strategic
purposes. This deal included LabAF SRL, SYNLAB.vet GmbH and Seaslab S.L.as entities and VET business of
SYNLAB Belgium SRL was sold via Asset Deal; for further information we refer to section 3.5 disposal group.

**3.2 Acquisitions**
The main acquisitions and corporate structuring activities undertaken during the reporting period are shown below.
The Group has continued its external growth strategy with several l diagnostic centers and hospital bolt-ons and
acquisitions. As standalone would have been immaterial from the point of view of the group, so we have combined
all other acquisitions as of 30 September 2023.

All acquisitions in the period earn revenues mainly from diagnostic centers and a hospital. Through these
acquisitions the Group expects to reduce costs through economies of scale, and the goodwill thus represents the fair
value of the expected synergies resulting from the acquisitions.

The transaction costs related to the completed acquisitions amount to 2.5 M€ (Q3 2022: 0.3 M€) and are recognised

disposal-related items".

The fair value of the trade accounts receivable amounts to 7.7 M€. The gross amount of trade accounts receivable is
7.8 M€. The impairment of trade accounts receivable amounts to 0.1 M€.

Goodwill amounting to 24.5 M€ reflects the provisional value of expected benefits from the Group acquisitions
including potential synergies. The allocation of additional goodwill per CGU group is as follows:

**For the nine months ended 30**
**€000**
**September 2023**

**CGU group**

Germany 9,330

North & East 1,258

South 13,865

**Total** **24,453**

Apart from asset deals in Germany, most of the goodwill recognised is expected to be non-deductible for tax
purposes.

All acquisitions have contributed 22.4 M€ to revenue with (0.6) M€ condensed consolidated net profit for the period
since their acquisition.

If the deals had been acquired as at the beginning of the year, revenue would have been 18.7 M€ higher and
condensed consolidated net profit for the period would have been 0.7 M€ higher.

On 31 May 2022, we acquired the remaining shares of Société d'Exercice Libéral Laboratoire Val de Garonne
SELARL.
On 17 January 2022, we established a new company in Belgium called SYNLAB Flanders SRL. However, we only
have 64.0% control of this company. The minority shareholders paid in 0.9 M€ at the time of incorporation.
We show this cash inflow for Belgium in the cash flow line “Contribution from non-controlling interests”.

As of 30 September 2022, the Group sold its veterinary business in Ireland and United Kingdom for strategic
purposes. This deal included Synlab VPG Limited and VLSI Limited entity. The portion of that gain attributable to
measuring any investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value at the date when control is lost was
follows 70.5 M€. In the condensed consolidated statement of income, the profit is shown under line “profit on
disposal of investment”. For this transaction, we received a cash inflow of 79.7 M€ and show the amount in the cash
flow line "Sale of subsidiaries, net of cash disposed and changes in debt".

**3.4 Acquisitions prior year**
The main acquisitions and corporate structuring activities undertaken during the reporting period are shown below,
by country. The Group has continued its external growth strategy with several laboratory bolt-ons and acquisitions.
As standalone would have been immaterial from the point of view of the group, so we have combined all other
acquisitions as of 30 September 2022.

All acquisitions in the period earn revenues mainly from genetic, medical or pathology analyses. Through these
acquisitions the Group expects to reduce costs through economies of scale, and the goodwill thus represents the fair
value of the expected synergies resulting from the acquisitions.

**3.5 Disposal group**

During the first half of the year 2023 the Group entered into agreements to dispose of all Swiss entities and VET
business as part of a strategic decision. The transaction was closed on July 3, 2023, for the Swiss entities.

Accordingly, the Swiss group companies SYNLAB Suisse SA, one-provide AG, Institut Arnaboldi AG and
Bakteriologisches Institut Olten BIO AG have been deconsolidated.

As of 29 September 2023, the Group sold its veterinary business in Belgium, Germany, and Spain for strategic
purposes. This deal included ANAPET SRL; SYNLAB.vet GmbH and Seaslab S.L. as entities and VET business of
SYNLAB Belgium SRL was sold via Asset Deal. In the condensed consolidated statement of income, the profit is
shown under line “profit on disposal of investment”.

The proceeds of disposal exceed the carrying amount of the related net assets and accordingly no impairment
losses have been recognised on the classification of these operations. The major classes of assets and liabilities
comprising the operations classified as disposed entities as follows:

#### 4. Segmental analysis

The information by geographical segment presented below corresponds to the information used by Group
management to allocate resources to the various segments and to assess each segment’s performance. The Group
uses Adjusted Operating Profit as the key measure of the segments’ results as it reflects the segments’ underlying
performance for the financial period under review.

Adjusted Operating Profit is one of the consistent measures within the Group. The policies applied to determine the
operating segments presented are set out in SYNLAB AG’s financials Note 3 “Significant accounting policies” as of
31 December 2022 in the Segment information section.

According to IFRS 8.23 assets and liabilities for each reportable segment should be reported if such amounts are
regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. Amounts in the statement of financial position are not reported
according to segment since they are currently not used for steering the Group, and the information cannot be made
available with reasonable effort.

The segment results and the reconciliation of the segment measure to the respective statutory items included in the
Group statement of income are as follows:

#### 7. Income tax expenses

The Group has operations in various tax jurisdictions which have different tax laws and rates. Consequently, the
effective tax rate on consolidated income may vary from year to year, according to the source of earnings. The effective
tax rate on consolidated income is also impacted by several factors especially the non-deductible interests and the
losses incurred particularly in certain holdings for which no deferred tax asset has been recognized. The income tax
charge for the interim period is calculated based on the estimated effective tax rate for the full year, for each tax entity
or sub-group.

#### 11. Goodwill

###### IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES 
The Group performs its annual impairment test in December and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value

may be impaired. The Group’s impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives is based on value
in-use calculations. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different cash generating

units were disclosed in the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.

The Group considers the relationship between its market capitalisation and its book value, among other factors, when

reviewing for indicators of impairment. As at 30 September 2023, the market capitalisation of the Group was below the

book value of its equity, indicating a potential impairment of goodwill. As a result, management performed an

impairment test as at 30 September 2023 for the cash generating units or groups of cash-generating units of the

SYNLAB Group.

The CGUs and group of CGUs as at 30 September 2023 are consistent with the ones for the year ended 31 December

2022. The carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each CGUs and group of CGUs and key assumptions of the

impairment testing model, in addition to adjusted EBITDA, are as follows:

SYNLAB AG

###### RESULT OF THE IMPAIRMENT TEST

Based on the impairment test model calculation performed, no impairment had to be recorded for any of the CGUs
and group of CGUs.

###### SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
A post-tax discount rate increase of 1% point would lead to a goodwill impairment for Germany, France and South

where it would lead to impairment of 106M€, 71M€ and 59M€ being recognized respectively.

A 5% decrease in the forecasted adjusted EBITDA (AEBITDA) over the forecast’s horizon (2023 – 2027) included in

the terminal value would lead to a goodwill impairment for Germany, France and South where it would lead to an

impairment of 75M€, 1M€ and 33M€ being recognized respectively.

A decrease of 1% point in long-term growth rate would lead to a goodwill impairment for Germany, France and South

where it would lead to impairment of 92M€, 48M€ and 36M€ being recognized respectively.

###### REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (RCF) AND TERM LOAN A COVENANTS 

RCF and the Term Loan A both include certain covenants related to reporting and information requirements as well as
certain financial covenants as defined in the agreements. As part of this, SYNLAB needs to ensure that on each Testing
Date the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is lower or equal to 4.00:1. A consolidated leverage ratio above the threshold
can trigger an event of default.

###### SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN B COVENANTS

The Senior Secured Term Loan includes certain maintenance covenants as well as some incurrence covenants as
defined in the agreements. A failure to meet the covenants would give the lender the right to terminate the facility
without notice.

###### LEASE LIABILITIES 
The Group has leases mainly for land,building and technical equipment (refer to Note 12 Right-of-Use Assets).

###### PROVISIONS FOR RESTRUCTURING

The provisions for restructuring reflect both provisions existing in the SYNLAB Group’s statement of financial position
as at the acquisition date and measured at fair value, as well as new provisions recognised for the restructuring plans
announced.

###### OTHER PROVISIONS 

The other provisions mainly relate to provisions for litigation. In the normal conduct of its business, the Group is involved
in legal proceedings relating to different matters: anti-trust, personnel, damages, and other claims with uncertainties
about the amount or timing of the outflows. According to management and as confirmed by legal counsel, the recorded
provision is considered to be sufficient to cover probable losses.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

To SYNLAB AG, Munich/Germany

**REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF THE GROUP**

**MANAGEMENT REPORT**

and loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated

statement of cash flows for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2022, and the notes to the consolidated
financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the group

accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the group corporate governance

statement included in section 38 of the group notes.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRS as adopted by
the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB and, in
compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the

Group as at 31 December 2022 and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31
December 2022, and

- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position. In
all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial annual, complies
with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our
audit opinion of the group management report does not include an opinion on the content of the group corporate
governance statement stated above.

Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 German Commercial Code (HGB), we declare that our audit has not led to any

report.

### Independent auditors report to the members of Synlab AG

**Basis for the Audit Opinions**

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance
with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014; referred to subsequently as “EU Audit Regulation”)
and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the
Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described
in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management
Report” section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group companies in accordance with the
requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German

professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2)
point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under

Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group

management report.

**Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the
consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2022. These matters were

addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our audit
opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.

In the following we present the key audit matters we have determined in the course of our audit:

1. Requirement for estimates in connection with the determination and cut-off of realised revenue in Germany

2. Recoverability of goodwill

3. Valuation of the provision for risks from antitrust proceedings

Our presentation of this key audit matter has been structured as follows:

a) description (including reference to corresponding information in the consolidated financial statements)

b) auditor’s response

SYNLAB AG

### Independent auditors report to the members of Synlab AG

**1. Requirement for estimates in connection with the determination and cut-off of realised revenue in Germany**

a) The Group generates revenue with a wide range of clinical laboratory and medical diagnostic services for
insurance companies, hospitals, individuals, pharmacies and national health organisations. These services are
primarily provided in the area of human medicine but also in the area of veterinary medicine.

On the one hand, the agreed accounting modalities are based on the respective country-specific conditions for
publicly regulated healthcare systems as well as on individual agreements concluded with any natural person
or legal entity outside of the publicly regulated healthcare system on the other hand. The accounting processes
resulting from the complex accounting laws – particularly in Germany – require estimates be made to a

significant extent at the end of the financial year when determining and cutting-off realised revenue.

In Germany, significant revenue estimates are necessary in the following areas:

i) Realisation of revenue in connection with tests performed but not yet finally billed. These revenues are
subject to risks regarding their measurement as assumptions on the determination of average prices are to

be made. When budgets are agreed upon, assumptions for forecasts for the budgeted period have to be
calculated additionally due to regular pricing depending on the volume. Moreover, when dealing with

regulated prices, assumptions on the consideration of billing restrictions need to be considered. These
estimates are particularly complex, especially in the German part of the Group, due to the multitude of existing
regulations.

ii) Revenue and/or quotes for services, respectively, that are billed via the public health insurance’s system
depend on doctors’ performance requirements in connection with set budgets public health insurance

companies have in due consideration of the according restriction instruments, which are only determined
well after the service has been rendered. The estimate is made considering historic information and values

as well as current expectations the executive directors have.

The Group revenue for the financial year 2022 ) includes cut-off revenue of mEUR 189.6 (prior year:
mEUR 235.7). Based on the estimate, the revenue share in Germany amounts to mEUR 128.2 (prior year:
mEUR 178.8).

This matter constitutes a key audit matter from our point of view, as a large extent of judgement is necessary
regarding the executive directors’ estimates and the results of these estimates are significant for the financial
statements overall. In light of the existing discretionary scopes and due to the complexity of the determining
methods and models, which served as basis, this matter was of particular importance during our audit.

Information provided by the parent company’s executive directors on material estimates when determining and
cutting off of revenue are included in sections 2.6.2 and 3 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

b) We tested the design and implementation of accounting-related internal controls and the general IT controls
from selected laboratory information, billing and accounting systems as well as regarding estimated revenues.

In addition, we developed an understanding of the relevant methods, assumptions and data sources used by
the executive directors regarding the estimated revenues. In order to assess the quality of the estimates in the
past, we have conducted retrospective analyses while critically assessing deviations. In so doing, we conducted

that we have ascertained ourselves from the billed population, plausibility checks based on historic information
and on external market data, regulations and agreements as well as understanding the executive directors’
billing method.

**2. Recoverability of goodwill**

a) As at 31 December 2022, the Group reports goodwill of m EUR 2,323 (2021: mEUR 2,440) in total, which overall
includes four cash-generating-units (“CGU”) and groups of CGUs, respectively.

As at 31 December 2022, the executive directors of the parent company carried out impairment tests of
goodwill in compliance with IAS 36 (impairment of assets), by means of a detailed measurement of the value

in use of the CGUs and CGU groups, respectively, by using the discounted cash flow model. The
determination of the value in use is based on the planning of SYNLAB AG’s executive directors, which

consists of a three-year plan (budget for 2023 and strategic medium-term planning 2024 to 2025) as well as a
projection for two more years, which is continued with assumptions on long-term growth rates. This planning
was updated in December based on current events. The budget and the medium-term planning are approved
by the supervisory board and the executive board, respectively.

In the context of the impairment test, even after taking into account the fair value less costs to sell of the cash
generating unit Germany, the executive directors arrived at an impairment of mEUR 213.0 in total.

The result of the impairment tests highly depends on the executive directors’ assessment of future cash
inflows to the respective CGUs and CGU groups as well as from the used discount rate (weighted average
cost of capital) and hence is subject to significant uncertainty. This issue was of particular importance within
the scope of our audit in light of the existing uncertainties and discretionary scope and due to the complexity of
the measurement model the measurement was based on.

Information provided by the executive directors of the parent company on the recoverability of goodwill as well
as their impairment tests are included in sections 2.6.2 and 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial
statements.

b) First of all, we developed an understanding of the relevant methods the executive directors applied as well as
of the assumptions and data sources used relating to the measurement of goodwill. This also included the
manner and ways of ascertaining the planning figures for future cash inflows as well as ascertaining the discount
rates.

According to our audit strategy we have conducted scaled audit procedures in accordance with our risk
assessment. Our risk assessment was primarily based on headroom and sensitivity analyses. Our audit
procedures, which were conducted step-by-step, are described below. When conducting the impairment tests,
we integrated internal measurement specialists into our audit team. With their help, we audited whether the
essential parameters used during the calculations such as for example the used discount rates and sustainable
growth rates in the perpetual pension as well as the planned cash inflows were appropriate, by comparing these
values with the multi-year budget figures for 2023 to 2027 adopted by the executive directors as well as by
checking the plausibility of the measurement assumptions made based on general and industry-specific market
forecasts and expectations as well as publicly available forecasts from financial analysts regarding SYNLAB

### Independent auditors report to the members of Synlab AG

AG. Apart from that, we examined the accuracy of the forecasts over time. We scrutinised the planned revenues
using internal evidence and provided information as well as publicly available external market assessments all
the while considering internal and publicly available external sources regarding their assessment on the
development of the coronavirus pandemic and its economic impact.

In addition, we examined the allocation of corporate assets and corporate costs to the CGUs and CGU groups,
respectively. Considering that even relatively small changes of the discount rate may have a significant impact
on the determined amount of the Company’s value, we also made the parameters used to determine each
discount rate (WACC) including the resulting weighted average cost of capital (WACC) plausible based on own
control and comparison calculations, respectively.

Finally, we examined the information provided by the executive directors in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements regarding the measurement of goodwill as well as the information provided on the
impairment tests with regard to their completeness and compliance with the requirements of IAS 36.

**3. Valuation of the provision for risks from antitrust proceedings**

a) In December 2022, SYNLAB Group received the statement of objections under current antitrust proceedings
from the Portuguese antitrust authority Autoridade da Concorrência(). The Autoridade da Concorrência

accuses various private laboratories in Portugal of colluding to limit price fixing and influence market allocation
and access. In addition to two Portuguese subsidiaries, the statement of objections of the Portuguese antitrust

authority also directly relate to SYNLAB AG as concerned party. In this context, a provision for processes and
risk provisions was set up in the consolidated financial statements in the reporting year. The risk assessment

to be made regarding the course of the antitrust proceedings and the evaluation of whether and to what extent
it is necessary to recognise a provision as a liability to cover the risks is characterised by estimates and

assumptions by the executive directors and is subject to a high degree of uncertainty, also due to the early
stage of the proceedings. From our point of view, this matter was of particular importance for our audit of the
consolidated financial statements for the 2022 financial year due to the considerable uncertainties regarding
the course and outcome of the proceedings as well as the possible effects of the antitrust proceedings on the
assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of SYNLAB Group.

The Company’s disclosures on the applied “Accounting and valuation principles” and on “Use of estimates and
assumptions” are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 2.6.2 and on
“Provisions” in section 30.

b) As part of our audit, we examined, among other things, the processes established by SYNLAB AG for recording,
for legal and accounting treatment and for the presentation of legal disputes and legal proceedings in the
consolidated financial statements. In the reporting year, this primarily concerned the substantive discussion of
the accusations made in the context of the above-mentioned antitrust proceedings and their possible
consequences. As the legal assessment and the resulting valuation decisions of the executive directors have
a direct impact on the consolidated result and the control-relevant parameter AEBITDA, we have assessed the
assessment and valuation, including the underlying methods and assumptions, of the executive directors under
involving an internal antitrust expert. Furthermore, we had several discussions with employees of the central
legal department of SYNLAB AG and its external experts for antitrust law issues and had the executive directors
explain to us the development and the reasons that led to their current assessment. The presentation of the
background and status of the antitrust proceedings as of the balance sheet date, including the assessments of


-----

SYNLAB AG

### Independent auditors report to the members of Synlab AG

the executive directors with regard to the risks resulting from this for SYNLAB Group, was made available to
us in summarised written form by the executive directors of the Company. As at the balance sheet date, we
have also obtained external lawyers' confirmations on the antitrust proceedings and assessed them with the
involvement of our internal antitrust expert. We also appreciated the competence, skills and objectivity of the
external lawyers commissioned by SYNLAB AG. On this basis, we have understood the assessments made by
the executive directors of the status of the proceedings and their decisions on the presentation of the facts
within the consolidated financial statements and, in particular, on the valuation of the provision recognised,
including the methods and assumptions used.

**Other Information**

The executive directors and the supervisory board are responsible for the other information. The other information

comprises:

- the report of the supervisory board,

- the remuneration report pursuant to Section 162 AktG,

- the subsection “Monitoring and Improvement of the Internal Control System and of the Risk Management system”

in section “5.1 Risk Management System” of the group management report,

- the separate non-financial group report pursuant to Sec. 315b to 315c, which will probably be provided to us after

the date of this Independent Auditor’s Report,

- the group corporate governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d HGB which is included in section

“Declaration on corporate governance” of the group management report, including the “Declaration of conformity
with the German Corporate Governance Code” contained therein, to which reference is also made in section 38 of

the group notes,

- the executive directors’ confirmation regarding the consolidated financial statements and the group management
report pursuant to Section 297 (2) sentence 4 and Section 315 (1) sentence 5 HGB, and

- all other parts of the annual report,

- but not the consolidated financial statements, neither the audited content of the group management report, nor our
auditor’s report thereon.

The supervisory board is responsible for the report of the supervisory board. The executive directors and the
supervisory board as well are responsible for the declaration related to the German Corporate Governance Code in
accordance with Section 161 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), which makes part of the above-mentioned
consolidated corporate governance statement. Otherwise, the executive directors are responsible for the other
information.

Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the
other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion
thereon.

SYNLAB AG

### Independent auditors report to the members of Synlab AG

In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information mentioned above and, in so doing, to
consider whether the other information

- is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report or our
knowledge obtained in the audit, or

- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

**Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial**

**Statements and the Group Management Report**

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all
material respects, with IFRS as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law
pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these
requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the
Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary
to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related
to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of
accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative
but to do so.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that as a
whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the
consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the
opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such
arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group
management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide
sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.

The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group**
**Management Report**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a
whole provides an appropriate view of the Company’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the
consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal
requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an
auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management
report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for


-----

SYNLAB AG

### Independent auditors report to the members of Synlab AG

Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material
misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
consolidated financial statements and this group management report.

We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group
management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material

misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.

- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of
arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the
effectiveness of these systems of the Company.

- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of
estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

- conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that

may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the

consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of
our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as
a going concern.

- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in
a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial
position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and with the
additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB.

- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities
within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management
report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely
responsible for our audit opinions.

- evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity
with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

- perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group
management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant
assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper

SYNLAB AG

### Independent auditors report to the members of Synlab AG

derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on
the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that
future events will differ materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing
of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during
our audit.

We provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant in-dependence
requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear
on our independence, and where applicable, the actions taken or safeguards applied to eliminate independence
threats.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the current period and are therefore the key audit
matters. We describe these matters in the auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about
the matter.

**OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS**

**Report on the Audit of the Electronic Reproductions of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the**

**Group Management Report Prepared for Publication Pursuant to Section 317 (3a) HGB**

**Audit Opinion**

We have performed an audit in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB to obtain reasonable assurance whether the
electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report (hereinafter
referred to as “ESEF documents”) prepared for publication, contained in the file, which has the SHA-256 value
3ac5638df719ac6029bd589991fe6d9f9b1e3daf228f042de469bb9c9ddc23ef meet, in all material respects, the
requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section 328 (1) HGB (“ESEF format”). In accordance with
the German legal requirements, this audit only covers the conversion of the information contained in the consolidated
financial statements and the group management report into the ESEF format, and therefore covers neither the
information contained in these electronic reproductions nor any other information contained in the file identified above.

In our opinion, the electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management
report prepared for publication contained in the file identified above meet, in all material respects, the requirements for
the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section 328 (1) HGB. Beyond this audit opinion and our audit opinions on
the accompanying consolidated financial statements and on the accompanying group management report for the
financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2022 contained in the “Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial
Statements and of the Group Management Report” above, we do not express any assurance opinion on the information
contained within these electronic reproductions or on any other information contained in the file identified above.

Section 328 (1) sentence 4 no. 2 HGB.

In addition, the executive directors of the Company are responsible for such internal controls that they have considered
necessary to enable the preparation of ESEF documents that are free from material intentional or unintentional noncompliance with the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to
Section 328 (1) HGB.

The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part of the
financial reporting process.

**Group Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the ESEF Documents**

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from material intentional
or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB. We exercise professional judgement
and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section

328 (1) HGB, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit on the ESEF documents in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion
on the effectiveness of these controls.

- evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e. whether the file containing the ESEF documents meets
the requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the balance sheet date, on
the technical specification for this electronic file.

- evaluate whether the ESEF documents enable a XHTML reproduction with content equivalent to the audited
consolidated financial statements and to the audited group management report.

- evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance with the
requirements of Articles 4 and 6 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the balance
sheet date, enables an appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML reproduction.

#### 2. Basis of preparation

Due to rounding, numbers presented throughout this and other documents may not add up precisely to the totals
provided and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.

###### 2.1 Statement of compliance

The consolidated financial statements relate to SYNLAB AG, Munich, Germany (commercial register number HRB
246540), and its subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union (EU), and the additional
requirements of German commercial law pursuant to section 315 e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The
consolidated financial statements comply with IFRS as published by the International Accounting Standards Board
(IASB). SYNLAB prepares and publishes the consolidated financial statements in euros (€).

###### 2.2 IFRS basis adopted

2.2.1 Standards, amendments and interpretations effective or adopted in 2022

From 1 January 2022, the Group applied a number of amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that are mandatorily effective for accounting periods beginning on
or after 1 January 2022. Their adoption did not have any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported
in these financial statements:

    - Amendments to IFRS 3 Reference to the Conceptual Framework

    - Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment – Proceeds before Intended Use

    - Amendments to IAS 37 Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract

    - Annual Improvements to IFRS Accounting Standards 2018-2020 Cycle

2.2.2 New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet applicable

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group had not applied the following new and revised
IFRS Accounting Standards that have been issued but are not yet effective

    - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (including the June 2020 and December 2021 amendments to IFRS 17)

    - Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28: Sale or Contribution of Assets

    - Amendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current

    - Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting Policies

    - Amendments to IAS 8: Definition of Accounting Estimates

    - Amendments to IAS 12: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction

The directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial
statements of the Group in future periods.

###### 2.3 Basis of measurement 

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for the following items in
the statement of financial position:

- derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and

- certain long-term financial assets are measured at fair value.

SYNLAB AG

###### 2.4 Functional and presentation currency

These consolidated financial statements are presented in euro, which is the Company’s functional currency. All
financial information presented in euro has been rounded to the nearest thousand.

###### 2.5 Going concern

The Group’s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

As at 31 December 2022, the Group had net assets of 2,333.2 M€ (31 December 2021: 2,255.7 M€) and net current
assets of 439.8 M€ (31 December 2021: 356.8 M€). For the year ended 31 December of 2022, the Group reported an
operating cash flow of 629.6 M€ (31. December 2021: 1,011.7 M€), cash flow from investing activities of -215.7 M€
(31 December 2021: -381.0 M€), cash flow from financing activities of -319.8 M€ (31 December 2021: -1,104.1 M€)
and cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period of 541.6 M€ (31 December 2021: 443.5 M€).

The directors consider the going concern basis to be appropriate following their assessment of the Group’s financial
position and its ability to meet its obligations as and when they fall due.

Testing, and particularly medical testing, is a resilient and defensive market on which past economic or capital market
downturns have only had a limited impact.

###### 2.6 Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of the consolidated Group financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates
and assumptions in applying the Group’s accounting policies to determine the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various
other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions to accounting
estimates applied prospectively.

**2.6.1 Critical accounting judgements**
In applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has applied judgement in the following areas that have a
significant impact on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.

###### LEASES

The evaluation of whether the exercise/non-exercise of purchase or extension/termination options is “reasonably
certain” may require substantial judgement.

The Group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination
option, upon the occurrence of either a significant event or a significant change in circumstances that:

- is within the control of the lessee; and

- affects whether the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option not previously included in its determination
of the lease term, or not to exercise an option previously included in its determination of the lease term.

The Group revises the lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a lease. For example, the noncancellable period of a lease will change if one of the following occurs:

- the lessee exercises an option not previously included in the entity’s determination of the lease term;

- the lessee does not exercise an option previously included in the entity’s determination of the lease term;


-----

SYNLAB AG

- an event occurs that contractually obliges the lessee to exercise an option not previously included in the entity’s
determination of the lease term; or

- an event occurs that contractually prohibits the lessee from exercising an option previously included in the entity’s
determination of the lease term.

The lease term may also be revised following a reassessment as to whether an extension option is reasonably certain
to be exercised, or whether a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised.

###### BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company, and each of those
companies over which it exercises control. Control over an entity exists when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over
the entity. When the Group has less than a majority of voting or similar rights in an entity, the Group considers all
relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an entity, including the contractual
arrangements, and voting rights and potential voting rights. The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an entity
if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to the elements of control. This assessment is key in certain
jurisdictions where the regulations governing the ownership and certification of laboratories require the Group to hold
each clinical laboratory or a limited number of the clinical laboratories through a separate subsidiary. Certain countries
also regulate the corporate form through which laboratories may be held, such as the Medizinisches
Versorgungszentrum (MVZ) in Germany and the société d’exercice liberal (SEL) in France. See Note 3, Basis of
consolidation, for further information.

**2.6.2 Key sources of estimation**

Information about assumptions and estimation concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation at the
reporting date, that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next financial year are included
in the following notes.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

###### REVENUE ESTIMATION

The Group earns revenues from a wide range of analysis and diagnostic testing services, which are invoiced to a range
of customers including insurance companies, hospitals, individuals, pharmacies and national health organisations. The
most significant areas of revenue estimation in the Group relate to:

a) revenue recognised based on as yet, unconfirmed public health budgets, where revenue is estimated using
historical patterns and other publicly available information (Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Spain being the main
countries in which this method is applied); and

b) accrued revenue based on completed but unbilled tests, where the calculation of the value of those tests include
a level of estimation based on

  - pricing mechanisms as agreed during contract negotiations and used to calculate average prices;

  - historical experience; and

  - actual work performed (e.g. analyses completed).

Based on historical data and experience, the measures are reliable, and the economic benefits associated with the
revenue recognised based on these measures are likely to flow to the entity.

SYNLAB AG

Please refer to Note 3 for further details.

###### GOODWILL AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL

The Group determines on an annual basis whether goodwill is impaired. The determination as to whether goodwill has
been impaired involves estimation of the key inputs in the impairment process including:

- the forecast cash flows and management assumptions for revenue growth and EBITDA margin used in making the
determinations which are based on financial budgets covering a five-year period;

- the key assumptions in calculating the discount rates applied to each cash-generating unit or group of cashgenerating units (“CGUs”), in particular the risk-free rate, equity risk premium, size premium and tax rates which
are used in the calculation; and

- the terminal growth rates applied to each of the CGUs.

Please refer to Note 17, Goodwill.

###### ACQUISITIONS

Acquisition accounting involves estimation in determining the fair value of the intangible assets through a purchase
price allocation assumed in a business combination and the fair value of the consideration payable. The key areas of
estimation include:

- estimates in accounting for any unusual terms and conditions in the respective share purchase agreement (“SPA”),
including contingent consideration. These amounts are contingent on the acquired business meeting agreed
performance targets. At the date of the acquisition, the Group reviews the profit and cash forecasts for the acquired
business and estimates the amount of contingent consideration that is likely to be due. See Note 31, Trade Payables
and other Liabilities; and

- the key assumptions within the fair value calculation of the intangible assets through a purchase price allocation,
specifically the discount rates, revenue growth rates and future cash flow forecasts.

Please refer to Note 4, Significant events, and Note 18, Intangible assets.

###### PENSION AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS

The determination of pension and other post-employment benefit obligations and expenses for defined benefit plans
is dependent on a number of estimates and assumptions, including the discount rate and future mortality rate. The
changes in assumptions and actuarial estimates may affect the benefit obligation, future expense and future cash flow.
Refer to Notes 3 and 28.

###### PROVISION FOR LITIGATION

The determination of provisions for litigation depends on a number of estimates and assumptions regarding the facts
of the case, the amount of damages, the amount of potential fines and the probability of occurrence.

Please refer to Note 30 provisions.

SYNLAB AG

**3. Significant accounting policies**

The accounting policies adopted for the preparation of the IFRS consolidated financial statements of SYNLAB AG are
described below.

The accounting policies have been applied consistently by Group entities and have not changed from those applied in
the 2021 consolidated financial statements of SYNLAB AG. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out
below.

**BASIS OF ACCOUNTING**

The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial
instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies
below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and
services.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or
estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into
account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account
when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in
these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions
that are within the scope of IFRS 2, leasing transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 16, and measurements that
have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in IAS 2 or value in use in IAS 36.

In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the
degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair
value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:

- Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can
access at the measurement date;

- Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly; and

- Level 3 are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, in particular SYNLAB’s own data.

**BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by
the Company (its subsidiaries) prepared as at 31 December each year. Control is achieved when the Company direct
or indirect:

- has power over the investee;

- is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and

- has the ability to use its power to influence those returns.

When the Company directly or indirectly has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it assesses whether
it has power over the investee if it has sufficient voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the
relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in
assessing whether or not the Company’s voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including:


-----

SYNLAB AG

- the size of the Company’s share of voting rights relative to the size and distribution of the proportions of other
holders of voting rights;

- potential voting rights held by the Company, other holders of voting rights or other parties;

- rights arising from other contractual arrangements including articles of association, shareholders’ agreement; and

- any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Company has, or does not have, the current ability to
direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made.

Regulations governing the ownership and certification of laboratories in certain jurisdictions require the Group to hold
each clinical laboratory or a limited number of the clinical laboratories through a separate subsidiary. Certain countries
also regulate the corporate form through which laboratories may be held, such as the MVZ in Germany and the SEL
in France.

In France, the Group is subject to regulatory constraints on the ownership of share capital and voting rights of SELs
operating clinical laboratories by persons other than laboratory doctors and laboratory companies. In fact, since the
French law on medical biology was adopted on 30 May 2013 (which includes a grandfathering clause for existing SELs
that operate under a different ownership structure where the majority of their share capital is held by laboratory
companies as of the date of enactment), laboratory doctors practicing in an SEL should hold the majority of voting
rights and the majority of the share capital. To comply with such regulatory constraints, the Group has put in place a
specific corporate structure, under which, and subject to a few exceptions, the Group, directly or indirectly, holds the
maximum percentage of shares authorised by the law (up to 99.9% of share capital for historical SELs owned before
May 2013 and 49.9% of share capital for SELs acquired since May 2013), while some of the laboratory doctors
practicing in said SEL hold the remaining shares. However, in all instances, the Group has been granted substantially
all of the economic rights. This is done by issuing preferred shares in cases where laboratory doctors practicing in said
SEL hold more than 50% of the share capital. The Group has therefore put in place mechanisms that grant it
substantially all of the economic rights in such SELs and allow it to control the relevant activities in accordance with
the French regulatory framework and to fully consolidate its French network. The control exercised over French
subsidiaries is based on specific governance mechanisms and contractual agreements with laboratory doctors
practicing in the SEL. These mechanisms and contractual agreements are classified by the Group as de facto control.

In Germany, German fee regulations mean that registered doctors outsource a wide range of laboratory procedures
to medical collaborative laboratories (“CLs”), which may also be responsible for billing. The sole shareholders of such
CLs are registered doctors co-operating to provide the required services in an economically viable way. As a laboratory
services provider, the SYNLAB Group thus sometimes has to cooperate based on contractual agreements with these
CLs in order to render services. As a consequence of these contracts, most of the benefits from the CL’s business
operations accrue to the Group, i.e. the Group has put in place mechanisms that grant it the majority of the economic
rights in such CLs and allow it to control the relevant activities in accordance with the German regulatory framework.
The Group therefore takes the view that it has control over the CLs even though it does not own a shareholding from
a legal perspective. These entities are therefore fully consolidated.

The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that
control commences until the date that it ceases.

All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between the
members of the Group are eliminated on consolidation.

The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are
changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.


-----

SYNLAB AG

Non-controlling interests (“minority interests”) represent the part of total income or loss, and of total equity not held by
the Group and are identified separately from the amounts attributable to the owners of the Company in the statement
of income, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of financial position.

Those interests of minority shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a corresponding
share of net assets upon liquidation may initially be measured at fair value or at the minority shareholders’
corresponding share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement is made on
an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. For medical biology companies, whether controlled de jure or de facto, minority
interests of other shareholders, i.e. laboratory doctors, must be assessed based on the financial rights attached to their
shares rather than the percentage of share capital or voting rights. The Group has an insignificant amount of minority
interests.

**BUSINESS COMBINATIONS**

Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired,
are accounted for using the acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is obtained.
The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of
the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners
of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related
costs, such as finder’s fees, legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional and consulting fees are expensed
as incurred and are presented in a dedicated aggregate “acquisition- and disposal-related items” line under other
operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income.

The Group measures goodwill as the difference between: (a) the sum of (i) the fair value of the consideration
transferred, (ii) the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, (iii) the acquisition-date fair value
of any previously held interest in the acquired business and (b) the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as at the acquisition date.

If, at the reporting date, the fair values of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities can only
be established provisionally, then these values are used. If we obtain new information within twelve months of the
acquisition date, these fair value adjustments are treated as adjustments to goodwill. Knowledge of facts and
circumstances that existed at the acquisition date is recognised in the consolidated statements of income.

When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes an asset or liability resulting from
a contingent consideration arrangement (e.g. earn-out), the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisitiondate fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a business combination. Any subsequent
changes after the closing date are recognised in profit or loss and are presented in the dedicated aggregate
“acquisition-related expenses” line. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not re-measured.

A contingent liability assumed in a business combination is recognised only if such a liability represents a present
obligation and arises from a past event, and its fair value can be measured reliably.

Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests

Acquisitions and/or disposals of non-controlling interests are accounted for as a transaction with equity holders in their
capacity as equity holders. Therefore, no goodwill is recognised or derecognised as a result of such transactions.

Acquisitions of achieved in stages

When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held interests in the acquired entity are
remeasured to their acquisition-date fair value, and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.


-----

SYNLAB AG

Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 are measured in accordance
with that standard.

**GOODWILL**

Goodwill is initially recognised and measured as set out above.

Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing,
goodwill is allocated to each of the group of CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cashgenerating units and groups of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more
frequently if there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.

If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first
to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on
the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed
in a subsequent period.

For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting
purposes corresponds to the CGUs described in Note 17, Goodwill. On disposal of a cash-generating unit, the
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

**INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES**

An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence, which is the power to participate in the financial
and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.

The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity
method of accounting. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognised in the consolidated
statement of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the profit or loss and
other comprehensive income of the associate. Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in an
associate is not recognised separately. When the Group’s share of losses of an associate exceeds the Group’s interest
in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in
the associate), the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to
the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or losses are made.

When a Group entity transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with
the associate are recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the
associate that are not related to the Group.

**REVENUE**

The Group earns revenues from a wide range of analysis and diagnostic testing services, which are invoiced to
insurance companies, hospitals, individuals, pharmacies, and national health entities.

Those services include mainly analysis and diagnostic testing services for human medicine, and in particular clinical
biological testing, including routine and specialty tests, anatomical pathology, histological or cytological testing and the
diagnostic imaging using medical and molecular imaging technologies, as well as testing services for veterinary
medicine.

The Group applies the principles set out in IFRS 15 for revenue recognition by using the following five steps:


-----

SYNLAB AG

1. Identify the contract(s) with a customer.

2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract.

3. Determine the transaction price.

4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.

5. Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

In general, contracts with customers are clustered in major revenue streams and their substreams. The revenue
recognition is outlined below for each separately.

Usually, the activities performed to generate revenue might include e.g. logistics, analytics and the provision of a result.
However, the service promised to the customer is an analysis (even in the case of multiple parameters), i.e. the
combined output of several activities that are either not capable of being distinct or not distinct within the context of the
contract (because they are highly interrelated). As a result, each contract (order) has only one performance obligation.

In order to determine the transaction price, the nature, timing and amount of consideration promised by a customer
are taken into account, as well as variable consideration, significant financing components and non-cash consideration,
if applicable. Amounts collected on behalf of third parties are excluded.

**Human medicine**

_Health insurance funds_

Generally, the contractual basis for revenue from health insurance funds comes from framework contracts and/or from
statutory regulations that define general terms and conditions that are applied to individual orders to perform an
analysis.

The basis for remuneration with respect to revenues differs by country, type of analysis and/or contract type. For
contracts that – despite fixed prices per analysis – contain elements that cause variability such as e.g. volume-based
discounts, allocated budgets/caps, and quotation rates, the amount of consideration will be estimated based on the
expected value and historical experience.

The (estimated) transaction price per analysis is recognised once the results of the analysis have been validated and
reported to the requester.

_Doctors_

In most cases SYNLAB acts as a principal whereas the doctor (as an agent) arranges the sale with the patient (while
using the results for their diagnosis). Each patient (customer) enters into a contract with SYNLAB as soon as the doctor
transmits the laboratory analysis form (order) with the required services and the patient information on behalf of the
patient. As a result, each order is considered to be a contract with the customer. Accordingly, SYNLAB generally
invoices the beneficiary (i.e. the patient) for laboratory services. For contracts where the doctor does not act as an
agent and is invoiced by SYNLAB the doctor is considered to be the customer.

The basis for remuneration per analysis and patient is generally based on regulated tariffs, i.e. medical fee schedules.

The (estimated) transaction price per analysis is recognised once the results of the analysis have been validated and
reported to the requester.


-----

SYNLAB AG

Any payments made to the doctor with respect to the collaboration agreement (e.g. signing fees or allowances per
analysis) reduce the transaction price. Depending on their nature, they either reduce revenue by order or over the
contract duration.

_Private patients_

Private patients are invoiced directly and, even if an insurance company might refund the private patient for the costs
incurred, the claim to consideration is against the private patient.

The transaction price for an analysis is based on medical fee schedules and, therefore, fixed upfront without later
adjustments. As each contract (order) has only one performance obligation, there is no need to allocate the transaction
price (per analysis).

The transaction price per analysis is recognised once the results of the analysis have been validated and reported to
the requester.

_Hospitals_

In the case of contracts with hospitals, SYNLAB often provides more than one service to the customer and/or delivers
more than one good. Therefore, in these cases, two or more contracts entered into at or near the same time with the
same hospital (or related parties of the hospital) have to be combined and accounted for as a single contract if (i) the
contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective; (ii) the amount of consideration to be paid
in one contract depends on the price or performance of the other contract; or (iii) the goods or services promised in
the contracts are considered to be a single performance obligation.

The activities performed to generate revenue might include e.g. logistics, analytics and the provision of a result. With
respect to lab operations, there are three major types of service arrangements:

Type 1: SYNLAB operates an external lab (outside the hospital’s premises). Accordingly, the arrangement typically
includes logistics services (transportation of samples from the hospital to the external lab).

Type 2: SYNLAB operates a lab on the hospital’s premises to meet quality standards (e.g. response times) or for
economic reasons (e.g. to reduce transportation cost), but is not legally bound to do so. SYNLAB has not promised to
operate a lab on the hospital’s premises and the hospital has no enforceable right to demand in-house lab operations.

Type 3: SYNLAB operates a lab on the hospital’s premises because it has promised to do so and the hospital has an
enforceable right to demand in-house lab operations.

For type 1 and type 2 arrangements, the service promised to the customer is an analysis, i.e. the combined output of
several activities that are either not capable of being distinct or not distinct within the context of the contract (because
they are highly interrelated). As a result, each contract (order) has only one performance obligation.

For type 3 arrangements, the promise to the customer constitutes the complete outsourcing of in-house lab operations
for a specified period of time. This bundled service also includes incidental services that are highly interrelated to the
outsourcing of in-house lab operations. Therefore, there is only one performance obligation, which is the operation of
the hospital’s in-house lab (including all analyses performed).

In type 1 and 2 arrangements, the transaction price for an analysis is typically based on medical fee schedules. In
addition, there might be volume-based discounts, allocated budgets/caps, quotation rates or other clauses that might


-----

SYNLAB AG

cause variability even if the price per analysis due to the medical fee schedule is fixed. In these cases, the amount of
consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for providing each analysis shall be estimated.

Type 3 arrangements typically include an annual fixed amount of consideration that might be constant or increase or
decrease from period to period. In addition, there is typically a variable component based on the number and complexity
of analyses actually performed within each period. Accordingly, the amount of consideration to which the entity will be
entitled in exchange for transferring the lab operation services to the hospital shall be estimated.

In each type of arrangement discussed above, there is only one performance obligation. In the case of type 1 and type
2 arrangements, the obligation is to perform an analysis. There is no need to allocate the (estimated) transaction price
(per analysis). In the case of type 3 arrangements, the obligation is to operate the hospital’s in-house lab for a specified
period of time. The transaction price shall be estimated for the total service period.

With respect to type 1 and type 2 arrangements, the (estimated) transaction price (per analysis) is recognised once
the results of the analysis have been validated and reported to the requester.

In type 3 arrangements, SYNLAB performs recurring services in relation to the in-house lab operations, which are
received and simultaneously consumed by the hospital. Thus, the performance obligation is satisfied over time (total
service period) and revenue shall be recognised by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that
performance obligation.

_Other labs, public agencies and other companies_

The contracting party ordering an analysis is the customer according to IFRS 15. In general, the contractual basis for
revenues from other labs, public agencies and other companies comes from general service agreements.

The activities performed to generate revenue might include e.g. logistics, analytics and the provision of a result.
However, the service promised to the customer is an analysis (even for multiple parameters), i.e. the combined output
of several activities that are either not capable of being distinct or not distinct within the context of the contract (because
they are highly interrelated). As a result, each contract (purchase order) has only one performance obligation. As each
contract (purchase order) has only one performance obligation, there is no need to allocate the (estimated) transaction
price (per analysis).

The basis for remuneration with respect to revenue from other labs, public agencies and other companies is the prices
stated in the contract. In general, the price for each kind of analysis is fixed.

With respect to revenue from other labs, public agencies and other companies, the (estimated) transaction price (per
analysis) is recognised once the results of the analysis have been validated and reported to the customer.

_Revenue from veterinary medicine_

In general, revenue from veterinary medicine is based on an offer and an acceptance with reference to a price list.
Typically, there is a standard price list with fixed prices for each kind of analysis.

The activities performed to generate revenue might include e.g. logistics, analytics and the provision of a result.
However, the service promised to the customer is an analysis (even for multiple parameters), i.e. the combined output
of several activities that are either not capable of being distinct or not distinct within the context of the contract (because
they are highly interrelated). As a result, each acceptance (order) has only one performance obligation.


-----

SYNLAB AG

As each acceptance (order) has only one performance obligation, there is no need to allocate the (estimated)
transaction price (per analysis). With respect to revenue from veterinary medicine, the transaction price (per analysis)
is recognised once the results of the analysis have been validated and reported to the customer.

_Revenue from trading goods_

The contracting party ordering the trading goods is the customer according to IFRS 15. The contractual basis for
revenue from trading goods can be a stand-alone contract or part of another contract (e.g. with hospitals or doctors).

Typically, trading goods are both capable of being distinct and distinct within the context of the contract. Accordingly,
each trading good is considered to be a separate performance obligation.

The basis for remuneration with respect to revenues from trading goods is the prices stated in the contract. In general,
the price for each trading good is fixed and – if the contractual basis is part of another contract – not interrelated to
other goods or services in that contract. Accordingly, there is no variability in consideration.

In general, the prices for trading goods as stated in the contract reflect the stand-alone selling price for such trading
goods, i.e. the price at which SYNLAB would sell the trading goods separately to another customer with similar
characteristics.

With respect to trading goods (that are considered to be a separate performance obligation), the transaction price for
the trading goods is recognised on delivery of the trading goods to the customer.

**LEASES**

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether the contract is or contains a lease. The Group recognises a
right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease arrangements in which it is the lessee,
except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets
(defined as all leases of assets with an original price of up to EUR 5,000.00 or local currency equivalent). For shortterm and low-value leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic
benefits from the leased assets are consumed.

Lease liabilities
When initially recognised, the lease liability is valued at the present value of the lease payments not yet made on the
provision date and discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:

- fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives;

- variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the
commencement date;

- the amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

- the exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and

- payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the
lease.

Variable rents that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and the
right of use asset. The related payments are recognised as an expense in the period in which the event or condition
that triggers those payments occurs.


-----

SYNLAB AG

The lease liability is presented as a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position. The lease liability
is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective
interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made.

The Group remeasures the lease liability and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset
whenever:

- the lease term has changed or there is a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which
case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.

- the lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a
guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is measured by discounting the revised lease payments
using the initial discount rate (unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating interest rate, in
which case a revised discount rate is used).

- a lease contract is modified, and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case
the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.

Lease payments

Lease payments included in the measurement of the liability comprise:

- fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;

- variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the
commencement date;

- the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option;

- payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the
lease; and

- the amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

- lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease and residual value guarantees.

The lease liability is subsequently measured after the commencement date by:

- increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest method);

- reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made.

Lease modifications

Modifications of leases are assessed to ascertain whether the modification should be accounted for as a separate
lease agreement or, effectively, a continuation of the existing lease.

Lease modifications are accounted as separate leases when both of the following conditions are met:

- the modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets; and

- the consideration for the lease increases by an amount commensurate with the stand-alone price for the increase
in scope and any appropriate adjustments to that stand-alone price to reflect the circumstances of the particular
contract.

When lease modifications are not accounted for as a separate lease at the effective date of the lease modification, the
Group

- allocates the consideration in the modified contract by applying the requirements of IFRS 16.13 to 16;

- determines the lease term of the modified lease by applying the requirements of IFRS 16.18 and 19; and


-----

SYNLAB AG

- remeasures the lease liability by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.

The Group accounts for the remeasurement of the lease liability as follows:

- for lease modifications that decrease the scope of the lease, by decreasing the carrying amount of the right of use
asset to reflect the partial or full termination of the lease. Any gain or loss relating to the partial or full termination
of the lease is recognised in profit or loss; and

- for all other lease modifications, by making a corresponding adjustment to the right of use asset and lease liability.

Right of use assets

The right of use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at
or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs. They are
subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Whenever the Group incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which
it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, a provision
is recognised and measured under IAS 37. To the extent that the costs related to a right of use asset, the costs are
included in the related right of use asset, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories.

Right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. If
a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset, or if the cost of the right of use asset reflects that the Group
expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right of use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying
asset. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease.

The right of use assets are presented as a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position.

The Group applies IAS 36 to determine whether a right of use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified
impairment loss as described in the policy on property, plant and equipment.

Short-term lease

The Group makes use of the short-term lease exemption for all leases that, as at the commencement date, have a
lease term of 12 months or less, including any extension options. Rentals for short-team leases are recognised as an
operating expense in profit or loss.

**FOREIGN CURRENCIES**

The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic
environment in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the
results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in euros, which is the functional currency of the
Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.

Foreign currency transactions and balances

In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s
functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the
transactions. At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are
retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.

Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates
prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical

SYNLAB AG

cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in
which they arise.

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign
operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.

Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates
fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity
(attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate).

Differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity are
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.

On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal
involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, or a partial disposal of an interest in a joint
arrangement or an associate that includes a foreign operation of which the retained interest becomes a financial asset),
all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the
Company are reclassified to profit or loss.

This year, Turkey was assessed as a hyperinflationary country. The Turkish Institute of Statistics reported a three-year
cumulative inflation rate of 109% for March 2022, and the country’s economy has been classified as hyperinflationary
since 30 June 2022. If the functional currency of an entity is that of a hyperinflationary economy, the accounting rules
of IAS 29 must be applied as if the currency of the economy had always been hyperinflationary (retrospective
application). IAS 29 was applied for the first time as if Turkey had always been classified as a hyperinflationary


-----

SYNLAB AG

economy. The net gains or losses from the ongoing inflation of non-monetary assets and liabilities as well as equity
and all items in the statement of income are recognised in profit or loss in other operating income. The financial
statements of these subsidiaries are generally based on the historical cost concept. Due to changes in the general
purchasing power of the functional currency, these financial statements had to be adjusted to the measurement unit
applicable on the reporting date. Comparative figures that previously corresponded to a non-hyperinflationary currency
do not need to be adjusted (unlike in the individual financial statements of Turkish companies). The total restatement
effect from the ongoing inflation is equal to 0.8 M€ for the period ended 31 December 2022 and is recognised in “other
operating income - Income from foreign currency transactions” line item.

The price index applicable to Turkey was 1.128,45 points as at 31 December 2022 (686,95 points as at 31
December 2021).

###### FINANCE INCOME AND FINANCE COSTS

Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested, dividend income, gains on hedging instruments that are
recognised at fair value in profit or loss and foreign currency gains. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in profit
or loss, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date that the Group’s
right to receive payment is established.

Finance costs comprise the cost of net debt and other financial expenses. Cost of net debt includes interest expense
on borrowings and financial leases, as well as expenses related to derivatives. Other financial expenses mainly include
the unwinding of the discount on provisions. Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition,
construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
The Group does not own any qualifying assets.

###### RETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS 

Depending on the laws and practices in force in the countries where the Group operates, Group companies have legal
obligations in terms of pensions, early retirement payments and retirement bonuses. Such obligations are generally
state-managed defined contribution plans, but the Group is also affected by post-employment or post-retirement
employees’ benefits.

#### Defined contribution plans

Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognised as an expense when employees have
rendered service entitling them to the contributions. Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit plans are
accounted for as payments to defined contribution plans where the Group’s obligations under the plans are equivalent
to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan.

#### Defined benefit plans and similar obligations

For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit
method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. Remeasurements
comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets
(excluding interest) are recognised immediately in the statement of financial position with a charge or credit to other
comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements recognized in other comprehensive income
are not reclassified. Past service cost is recognised in profit or loss when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs,
or when the Group recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits, if earlier. Gains or losses on the
settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised when the settlement occurs. Net interest is calculated by applying
a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are split into three categories:


-----

SYNLAB AG

- service cost, which includes current service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on curtailments and
settlements;

- net interest expense or income; and

- remeasurements.

The Group recognises service cost within profit or loss as payroll-related expenses (see Note 8). Net interest expense
or income is recognised within finance costs (see Note 13). The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the
consolidated statement of financial position represents the deficit or surplus in the Group’s defined benefit plans. Any
surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of
refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans. Details of the assumptions used are included
in Note 27 to the financial statements.

A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of the
termination benefit and when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs. Discretionary contributions made
by employees or third parties reduce service cost upon payment of these contributions to the plan. When the formal
terms of the plans specify that there will be contributions from employees or third parties, the accounting treatment
depends on whether the contributions are linked to service, as follows:

- If the contributions are not linked to service, they are reflected in the remeasurement of the net defined benefit
liability (asset).

- If contributions are linked to service, they reduce service cost.

###### TAXATION

#### Current income taxes

The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
statement of income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and
it also excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

The Group adopted IFRIC 23. IFRIC 23 sets out how to determine the accounting tax position when there is uncertainty
over income tax treatments. The Interpretation requires the Group to:

- Determine whether uncertain tax positions are assessed separately or as a group; and

- Assess whether it is probable that a tax authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment used, or proposed to be
used, by an entity in its income tax filings:

`o` If yes, the Group should determine its accounting tax position consistently with the tax treatment used or
planned to be used in its income tax filings.

`o` If no, the Group should reflect the effect of uncertainty in determining its accounting tax position using
either the most likely amount or the expected value method.

#### Deferred tax

According to IAS 12 the balance sheet liability method is used for deferred tax accounting. Deferred taxes are
recognized for temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the
consolidated statement of financial position, and for tax losses and interest carryforwards Deferred tax liabilities are


-----

SYNLAB AG

generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it
is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects
neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group can control the reversal of the temporary difference
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising
from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent
that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary
differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled, or the
asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited
in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income.

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the way
the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

In accordance with IAS 12, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.

#### Current tax and deferred tax for the year

Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial
accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination.

#### Value-added tax (VAT)

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated VAT, unless the VAT incurred is not
recoverable from the taxation authority. The main SYNLAB Group activities being related to medical services are
exempt from VAT in most of the countries in which the Group operates. In this case the Group cannot recover VAT
applicable to charges and expenses relating to those VAT exempt activities and it is recognised as part of the cost of
the acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense. In the case of Group companies for which partial reimbursement
of VAT is possible, the non-reimbursable portion of VAT is not deducted.

The VAT amount to be refunded by or paid to the tax authority is recognised in the statement of financial position under
“Other current assets” or under “Other liabilities”.

SYNLAB AG

###### PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset, and subsequent expenditure is
capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.

Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.

If material parts of property, plant and equipment must be replaced at regular intervals or have different useful lives,
the Group capitalises such parts as separate assets (major components) with specific useful lives or depreciation
periods.

Other maintenance and repair costs are recorded in profit or loss. The net present value of expected costs for disposal
of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the criteria for recognition have been fulfilled.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when the asset is permanently withdrawn
from use and no future economic benefits are expected. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant
and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant
and equipment, and are recognised net within other operating income in profit or loss.

###### DEPRECIATION

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives, using
the straight-line method.

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period,
with the effect of any changes in estimates accounted for on a prospective basis.

The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:

- Land and buildings: 15 to 50 years

- Technical machines and equipment: 3 to 10 years

- Vehicle fleet: 3 to 7 years

- Other fixed assets: 2 to 10 years

###### INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets are recognised for the first time at acquisition cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a
business combination is calculated as the fair value on the date of acquisition.

Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets with finite useful lives acquired separately or in a business
combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

Amortisation is charged to the statement of income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives.


-----

SYNLAB AG

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

- Customer relationships: 3 to 25 years

- Trademark (own brand): indefinite

- Property rights and similar rights: 3 to 6 years

- Software: 1 to 7 years

Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. An internally
generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) is
recognised if, and only if certain conditions have been demonstrated. Expenditure on software development is
capitalised when it is probable that the project will, after considering its commercial and technical feasibility, be
completed and generate future economic benefits and the costs can be measured reliably.

During the initial purchase price allocation when setting up the SYNLAB Group, the SYNLAB brand was identified as
an intangible asset by the acquirer, SYNLAB Limited, which was an independent third party in this process, at that
time. As the SYNLAB brand has existed since the creation of the company in 1998, and as SYNLAB is the largest
European laboratory operator with a global presence, an indefinite useful life has been retained.

The amount initially recognised for internally generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from
the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internally generated
intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it is
incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, internally generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately.

Intangible assets are derecognised either upon disposal or when no economic benefits are expected to flow from
further use or from the disposal of the recognised asset. Profit or loss arising from the derecognition of the asset are
recorded in the statement of income as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of
the asset in the period in which the asset is derecognised.

###### IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL

At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss. An intangible asset with
an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset
may be impaired.

The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of the fair value of an asset or a cash-generating unit (CGU) less
cost of sale and the value in use. The recoverable amount must be determined for each individual asset unless a
particular asset does not generate any cash flows that are largely independent of other assets or other groups of
assets, in which case the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs. If the
carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its respective recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and is reduced
to the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is
carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.

Value in use is the net present value of future expected cash flows using a discount rate before tax that reflects market
expectations with respect to the interest rate effect and the specific risk of the asset. Recent market transactions, if
applicable, are taken into consideration when determining the fair value less any cost of sale. If there are no such


-----

SYNLAB AG

identifiable transactions, a suitable valuation model is used. This is based on valuation multiples or other available
indicators of fair value.

Assets other than goodwill are assessed at every reporting date to determine whether there are indications that a
previously recorded impairment loss no longer exists or has been reduced. If such indications are present, the Group
assesses the recoverable value of the asset or the CGU. Any previously recorded impairment losses are only reversed
if a change in the assumptions that formed the basis for the determination of the recoverable amount has taken place
since recording the last impairment loss. The impairment reversal is limited by the fact that the carrying amount of an
asset may exceed neither its recoverable amount nor the carrying value that would have remained after scheduled
depreciation if in prior years no impairment losses for the asset had been recorded.

###### INVENTORIES

Inventories consist of raw materials (“reagents”) and consumables and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable
value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted
average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and
selling expenses.

###### FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly
attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or
financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of
financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statement of financial position when,
and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

###### FINANCIAL ASSETS

Ordinary purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular way
purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame
established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.

All recognised financial assets are measured subsequently in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value,
depending on the classification of the financial assets.

Classification of financial assets

Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are measured subsequently at amortised cost:

- the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect
contractual cash flows; and

- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.


-----

SYNLAB AG

The Group has an immaterial amount of debt financial assets that are recognised at fair value through other
comprehensive income (FVTOCI). By default, all other financial assets are measured subsequently at fair value
through profit or loss (FVTPL).

1) Amortised cost and effective interest method

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating
interest income over the relevant period. For financial assets, the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts
estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective
interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts), excluding expected credit losses, through the
expected life of the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the gross carrying amount of the debt
instrument on initial recognition.

The amortised cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured at initial recognition
minus the principal repayments, plus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference
between that initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance. The gross carrying amount of a
financial asset is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any loss allowance. Interest income is
recognised using the effective interest method for debt instruments measured subsequently at amortised cost. Interest
income is recognised in profit or loss and is included in the "net finance costs – interest income" line item. For these
financial instruments, the Group measures the loss allowance equal to the 12-month expected credit losses, as there
has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.

2) Financial assets at FVPL

Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortised cost, are subsequently measured at
FVTPL and are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any fair value gains or losses
recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss includes any dividend or interest earned
on the financial asset. Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 33.

A financial asset is held for trading if:

- it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling it in the near term; or

- on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and
for which the Group has evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or

- it is a derivative (except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging
instrument).

Financial assets are categorised into current and non-current assets in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Current financial assets comprise:

- financial assets with a settlement or maturity date within 12 months of the statement of financial position date.


-----

SYNLAB AG

#### Equity instruments

 Equity instruments designated as at FVTOCI

On initial recognition, the Group may make an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to designate
investments in equity instruments as at FVTOCI. Designation at FVTOCI is not permitted if the equity investment is
held for trading or if it is contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination.

Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently,
they are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognised in other
comprehensive income. The cumulative gain or loss is not to be reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the equity
investments, instead, it is transferred to retained earnings.

Dividends on these investments in equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9, unless
the dividends clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Dividends are included in the “finance
income” line item (Note 12) in profit or loss.

The Group has designated all investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading as at FVTOCI.

#### Impairment of financial assets

The Group has adopted the simplified expected credit loss model for its trade receivables. To measure the expected
credit losses, trade accounts receivable have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days
past due. Moreover, reasonable and supportable information (if available without undue cost or effort) at the reporting
date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions have been taken into account
in the calculations. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit
risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument.

The Group writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty
and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, such as when the debtor has been placed under liquidation or has
entered into bankruptcy proceedings. Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under
the Group’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are
recognised in profit or loss.

Definition of default

The Group considers the following as constituting an event of default for internal credit risk management purposes, as
historical experience indicates that financial assets that meet either of the following criteria are generally not
recoverable:

- information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its
creditors, including the Group, in full (without taking into account any collateral held by the Group).

The Group writes off a trade receivable only when the trade receivable is uncollectable and there is information
indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, such as when
the debtor has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings. Other overdue trade
receivables are not considered written off, since there is, in fact, no risk of default and only a risk of late payment. In
general, there are longer payment settlement periods for trade receivables, as the business partners are commonly


-----

SYNLAB AG

represented by institutional organisations such as public and private hospitals, public health insurance funds and public
health agencies. Payments are generally secured in terms of contract arrangements.

Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is more than
90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging
default criterion is more appropriate.

#### Derecognition of financial assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or
when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another
entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to
control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for
amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred
financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for
the proceeds received. On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortised cost, the difference between the
asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognised in profit or loss. On
derecognition of an investment measured at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the
investment revaluation reserve is not reclassified to profit or loss, but is transferred to retained earnings.

###### FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY

Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance
of the contractual arrangement.

#### Financial liabilities

All financial liabilities are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method or at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities include borrowings, trade and other payables, derivative financial instruments and other financial
liabilities.

Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the liability is (i) contingent consideration of an acquirer in a
business combination, (ii) held for trading or (iii) designated as at FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as held for
trading if it has been acquired principally for the purpose of repurchasing it in the near term, or on initial recognition it
is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern
of short-term profit; or it is a derivative, except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee or a designated and effective
hedging instrument. All other financial liabilities are held at amortised cost.

Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL are measured at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on changes in fair
value recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the
financial liability.

Financial liabilities that do not meet the criteria to be FVTPL are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs,
and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense
recognised on an effective yield basis.

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating
interest expense over the relevant period. On initial recognition, any issue or redemption premiums and discounts and
issuing costs are added to or deducted from the nominal value of the borrowings concerned. These items are taken
into account when calculating the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts


-----

SYNLAB AG

estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter
period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.

Financial liabilities are categorised into current and non-current liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial
position. Current financial liabilities comprise:

- financial liabilities with a settlement or maturity date within 12 months of the statement of financial position date;
and

- financial liabilities in respect of which the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for at
least 12 months after the statement of financial position date.

#### Derecognition of a financial liability

The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled
or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the
consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss.

#### Derivative financial instruments

The Group may enter into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange
rate risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently
remeasured to their fair value at each reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.

A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset, whereas a derivative with a negative fair value
is recognised as a financial liability. Derivatives are not offset in the financial statements unless the Group has both
the legal right and intention to offset them. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if
the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within
12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.

The Group does not apply any hedge accounting.

#### Embedded derivatives

An embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid contract that also includes a non-derivative host – with the effect
that some of the cash flows of the combined instrument vary in a way similar to a stand-alone derivative.

Derivatives embedded in hybrid contracts with a financial asset host within the scope of IFRS 9 are not separated. The
entire hybrid contract is classified and subsequently measured at either amortised cost or fair value as appropriate.
Derivatives embedded in hybrid contracts with hosts that are not financial assets within the scope of IFRS 9 (e.g.
financial liabilities) are treated as separate derivatives when they meet the definition of a derivative, their risks and
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts, and the host contracts are not measured at fair
value.

An embedded derivative is presented as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the
hybrid instrument to which the embedded derivative relates is more than 12 months and is not expected to be realised
or settled within 12 months.

###### CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, bank current accounts, and other bank deposits and short-term
investments considered to be readily convertible into a known amount of cash and where the risk of a change in their
value is deemed to be negligible based on the criteria set out in IAS 7.

Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are recorded
under “Short-term borrowings” but included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the
statement of cash flows.

###### PROVISIONS

A provision is recognised if the Group has a present (legal or constructive) obligation arising from a past event,
expenditure of resources with an economic benefit to fulfil the obligation is likely, and a reliable assessment of the
amount of the obligation is possible. If an accrued liability is expected to be reimbursed at least in part (e.g. liabilities
covered under an insurance policy), the reimbursement is classified as a separate asset, provided that there is a high
probability of it occurring. The expense for such a provision is reported in the consolidated statement of income less
any reimbursement.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation
at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is
measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, the carrying amount is the present value of
those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material for a cash outflow after more than one year).
Discount rates reflect current assessments of the time value of money and risks that are specific to the liability and not
included in expected cash flows. The unwinding of the discount is recorded as finance costs.

A provision for restructuring is only recognised when the Group has a formalised restructuring plan setting out detailed
requirements regarding the business unit or part of the business unit concerned, the site and the number of employees
concerned, as well as a detailed estimate of associated cost and a reasonable time schedule. The employees
concerned must justifiably expect that the restructuring will take place, or it must have already begun.

###### SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

Share-based payment arrangements in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity
instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions, regardless of how the equity
instruments are obtained by the Group. The expenses also include any social charges to be paid on the shares granted.

For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the goods or services acquired, measured initially
at the fair value of the liability. At reporting date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value
of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the year.

Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair
value of the equity instruments at the grant date. Fair value is determined using a suitable option pricing model. The
fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. Details regarding the determination of the fair
value of equity-settled share-based transactions are set out in Note 27, Share-based payments.

The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each
reporting date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the
effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised


-----

SYNLAB AG

in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to
equity reserves.

This vesting period ends at the first possibility to exercise the option (i.e. when the employee concerned is irrevocably
entitled to exercise the option). The cumulative expenses recorded for equity-settled share-based payment
transactions thereby reflect, at any reporting date up to the date of first possibility of exercising the option, the vesting
period already expired as well as the number of equity instruments which, based on the best estimate of management,
will eventually vest. However, the amount by which the Group’s income is reduced or increased reflects the change in
cumulative expenses reported at the beginning versus the end of the reporting period.

Forfeited equity instruments granted for remuneration are not recorded as expense. An exception is granted for equity
instruments granted for which non-forfeitability is based on certain market or non-vesting conditions. These equity
instruments granted are deemed to be exercisable regardless of whether the market or non-vesting conditions are
fulfilled, as long as all performance and service conditions have been fulfilled.

If the underlying conditions of an equity-settled share-based payment transaction are changed, expenses are recorded
in the minimum amount of costs that would have been incurred if contractual conditions had not been changed,
provided that the original conditions of the remuneration agreement are fulfilled. The Company also records the effect
of changes that increase the fair value of the share-based payment or are related to any other benefit for the employee,
valued at the date of the change.

If an equity-settled share-based payment agreement is cancelled, this is treated as if the option had been exercised
on the day of cancellation. Expenditure not yet recognised is recorded immediately. This applies to all remuneration
agreements for which non-vesting conditions on which either the Company or the employee have an influence have
not been fulfilled. However, if the cancelled remuneration agreement, either equity or cash-settled, is replaced by
another remuneration agreement declared on the day it is granted as replacement for the cancelled remuneration
agreement, the cancelled agreement and the new remuneration agreement are recorded as a change to the original
remuneration agreement with an impact limited to the incremental fair value granted, if any, during replacement.

###### NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN PARTNERSHIPS/PUT OPTIONS

Pursuant to the rules prescribed by IAS 32, non-controlling interests in partnerships for which minority partners have
a right of termination are recorded as a liability. In the same manner, shares for which the minority shareholders have
been granted a put option by the majority partner are to be recognised at the fair value of the purchase price as an
obligation. If this is done for a business combination, the business combination is accounted for as if the non-controlling
interests had already been acquired. As a result, goodwill is recognised in full. Such shares are shown on the Group
statement of financial position as a liability under “Other liabilities”. Income from these shares which can be withdrawn
by the minority partner is shown in the consolidated statement of income in “Other financial expenses”.

###### ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT 

In the analysis of the Group’s operating results, we present certain non-IFRS measures as (i) they are used by
management to measure operating performance, in presentations to our board members, and as a basis for strategic
planning and forecasting, and (ii) they represent similar measures that are widely used by certain investors, securities
analysts and other parties as supplemental measures of performance. These measures enhance management’s and
investors’ understanding of our financial performance by excluding items that are outside of ongoing operations such
as acquisition-related costs including integration costs, strategic project costs (e.g. the IPO in 2021), impairment and
reversal of impairment of non-operational assets, income taxes and costs of capital.


-----

SYNLAB AG

We believe that adjusted operating profit is widely used by investors to measure our operating performance and can
vary substantially from company to company depending on the accounting methods, book value of assets and capital
structure or method by which assets were acquired. This adjusted measure eliminates potential differences in
performance caused by variations in capital structures (affecting net finance costs), tax positions (such as the
availability of net operating losses against which to relieve taxable profits), the cost and age of tangible assets (affecting
relative depreciation expense) and the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable (affecting relative amortisation
expense). This adjusted measure also eliminates the effect of additional specific items that are considered to hinder
comparison of the trading performance of our business year on year.

However, non-IFRS measures are not measures or adjustments determined based on IFRS or any other internationally
accepted accounting principles, and such items should not be considered as an alternative to the historical financial
results or other indicators of our performance based on IFRS measures. Due to differences in the way our non-IFRS
measure is calculated, the non-IFRS measure, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
as presented by other companies. Even though non-IFRS measures are used by management to assess ongoing
operating performance and these types of measures are commonly used by investors, they have important limitations
as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of SYNLAB’s results as
reported under IFRS.

In calculating adjusted operating profit certain items are added back.

Adjusted Operating Profit

- Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)

- Share of loss of associates and other non-controlling interest

- Acquisition and integration-related costs

- Other non-recurring costs from strategic projects (see Note 5)

- Less depreciation and amortisation of all items, except for amortisation of customer relationships

Adjusted operating profit is the Group’s segment performance measure and has therefore been disclosed in Note 5.

###### SEGMENT INFORMATION

In accordance with IFRS 8, the reportable segments are components of the Group that engage in business activities
and whose operating results based on the internal reporting are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decisionmaker.

Segment performance is mainly assessed based on total revenue and adjusted operating profit and is measured in
line with the statement of income in the consolidated financial statements. All costs initially borne by the head office
are allocated to those segments when directly attributable. General costs are assigned to the segments on a revenue
basis, whereas costs with a closer relationship to single segments are allocated on a case-by-case scenario. The
Group’s financing (including finance costs and finance income) and income taxes are centrally managed on a Group
basis and are not allocated to operating segments.

This is the basis on which internal reports are provided to the chief operating decision-maker for assessing
performance and determining the allocation of resources within the Group.


-----

SYNLAB AG

###### DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUES

A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both financial
and non-financial assets and liabilities.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within
the three-level fair value hierarchy.

For assets or liabilities repeatedly reported in the financial statements, the Group determines any hierarchy level reclassification by re-evaluating the existing classification at the end of each reporting period. Such revaluation is based
on the lowest-level input parameters which are essential for fair value measurement.

#### Property, plant and equipment

The fair value of property, plant and equipment recognised as a result of a business combination is based on market
values. The market value of property is the estimated amount that would be received to sell a property in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of items of plant, equipment, fixtures
and fittings is based on the market approach and cost approaches using quoted recent market prices for similar items
when available and current replacement cost when appropriate.

#### Trade and other receivables

The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the
market rate of interest at the reporting date. The net carrying value is considered as a reasonable estimate of their fair
value considering the short payment and settlement periods applied by the Group. This fair value is determined for
disclosure purposes.

#### Derivatives

The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on broker quotes. Those quotes are tested for reasonableness on an ad
hoc basis by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using
market interest rates for a similar instrument at the measurement date. Fair values also reflect the credit risk of the
instrument and include adjustments to take account of the credit risk of the Group entity and counterparty when
appropriate.

#### Non-derivative financial liabilities

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal
and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.

#### Share-based payment transactions

The fair value of employee share options is generally measured using a binomial lattice model. Measurement inputs
include the share price on the measurement date, the exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on
weighted average historic volatility of similar quoted entities), the weighted average expected life of the instruments
(based on historical experience and general option holder behaviour), expected dividends and the risk-free interest
rate (based on government bonds). Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the transactions are
not taken into account in determining fair value.

On 17 January 2022, we established a new company in Belgium called SYNLAB Flanders SRL. However, we only
have 64.0% control of this company. The minority shareholders paid in 0.9 M€ at the time of incorporation.
We show this cash inflow for Belgium in the cash flow line “Proceeds from non-controlling interests”.

As of 30 September 2022, the Group sold its veterinary business in Ireland and United Kingdom for strategic
purposes. This deal included Synlab VPG Limited and VLSI Limited entity. The portion of that gain attributable to
measuring any investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value at the date when control is lost was
follows 70.5 M€. In consolidated statement of income, the profit is shown under line “profit on disposal of
investment”. For this transaction, we received a cash inflow of 79.7 M€ and show the amount in the cash flow line
"Sale of subsidiaries, net of cash disposed and changes in debt".

**4.2 Acquisitions**
The main acquisitions and corporate structuring activities undertaken during the reporting period are shown below,
by country. The Group has continued its external growth strategy with several laboratory bolt-ons and acquisitions.
As standalone would have been immaterial from the point of view of the group, so we have combined all other
acquisitions in the financial year.

All acquisitions in the period earn revenues mainly from genetic, medical or pathology analyses. Through these
acquisitions the Group expects to reduce costs through economies of scale, and the goodwill thus represents the fair
value of the expected synergies resulting from the acquisitions.

The fair value of the trade accounts receivable amounts to 8.0 M€. The gross amount of trade accounts receivable is
8.4 M€. The impairment of trade accounts receivable amounts to 0.4 M€

Goodwill amounting to 95.5 M€ reflects the provisional value of expected benefits from the Group acquisitions
including potential synergies. The allocation of additional goodwill per CGU group is as follows:

Apart from asset deals in Germany, most of the goodwill recognised is expected to be non-deductible for tax
purposes.

All deals have contributed 42.0 M€ to revenue with 0.3 M€ consolidated net profit for the period from continuing
operations since their acquisition.

If the deals had been acquired as at the beginning of the year, revenue would have been 41.4 M€ higher and

#### 5. Segmental analysis

The information by geographical segment presented below corresponds to the information used by Group
management to allocate resources to the various segments and to assess each segment's performance. The Group
uses Adjusted Operating Profit as a key measure of the segments’ results as it reflects the segments’ underlying
performance for the financial period under review.

Adjusted Operating Profit is one of the consistent measures within the Group. The policies applied to determine the
operating segments presented are set out in Note 3, “Significant accounting policies”, in the Segment information
section. Prior year comparatives only include the results of continued operations.

According to IFRS 8.23 assets and liabilities for each reportable segment should be reported if such amounts are
regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. Amounts in the statement of financial position are not reported
according to segment since they are currently not used for steering the Group, and the information cannot be made
available with reasonable effort.

The segment results and the reconciliation of the segment measure to the respective statutory items included in the
Group statement of income are as follows:

Goodwill values for the acquisitions made during the period ended 31 December 2022 are provisional and subject to
modification in the twelve months period following the acquisition date.


###### IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR CASH-GENERATING UNITS CONTAINING GOODWILL 

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units or groups of cash-generating units
(“CGUs”) defined at the level of main countries or geographical zones, which represent the lowest level within the
Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.


The CGUs and group of CGUs for the year ended 31 December 2022 are Germany, France, South and North & East.

This CGUs and group of CGUs definition is consistent with the current operating segment structure of SYNLAB Group

and directly results from its reorganization in 2020. Consequently, the current CGUs and group of CGUs structure

reflects the change in management approach and approach in monitoring the results of the Group.

testing model are as follows:

###### RECOVERABLE AMOUNT

The recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit was based on its value in use which was determined by
discounting the future cash flows generated from the continuing use of the unit. The main assumptions on which the
value in use of a cash generating unit is based are the discount rate and trends in volumes, prices and direct costs
(inflation) over the period.

The calculation of the value in use was based on the following key assumptions:

- The Group’s latest available five-year business plan shows trends in volumes, prices and direct costs based on
past trends and the future market outlook which includes a specific level of uncertainties. This five-year business
plan was reviewed in the current context of difficult economic environment in some European countries.

- The cash flow projections for the years 2023 to 2027 also include:

`o` taxes impact by applying the latest enacted rate per country;

`o` working capital; and

`o` capital expenditures

- The terminal value is then calculated by discounting the forecast flows of the past year (2027 as the steady state
of the respective CGU) using a sustainable growth rate between 1,6% and 2,0% (2021: 0.7% and 1.1%) depending

on the cash-generating unit. This percentage is management’s best estimate of the inflationary growth effects
based on the long-term inflation rates for each CGU.

- The discount rate is based on the respective CGU’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC), including a
leveraged beta, market risk premium, country risk premium and cost of debt.

- The discount rates used are post-tax discount rates applied to post tax cash flows. Applying those rates results
in a value in use materially consistent to those computed using pre-tax discount rates applied to pre-tax cash
flow. (as required by IAS 36).

###### RESULT OF FULL YEAR IMPAIRMENT TESTING

Based on the impairment test model calculation performed, the recoverable amount for the CGU Germany amounts
to 753M€ and there was an impairment of 213M€ recognized for the CGU Germany.

The impairment in Germany has been largely the consequence of the overall geopolitical situation which affected our
German CGU in two (2) ways. Firstly, the rise in the yield of the 30-year German government bond increased the
WACC of the CGU and secondly, the current high inflationary environment weakened our outlook for the German
CGU.

The financial plans are also based on assumptions about the effects of climate change and the influence of other
sustainability-relevant aspects on the business development of SYNLAB.
For the SYNLAB Group, climate-related risks as a result of the necessary implementation of regulatory requirements
to promote a circular economy and limit climate change did not have any significant impact on the determination of the
recoverable amounts of the CGUs or groups of CGUs.

###### SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

A post-tax discount rate increase of 1% point would lead to a goodwill impairment in Germany & France where it would
lead to impairment of respectively 106M€ and 125M€ being recognized.

A 5% decrease in the forecasted EBITDA over the forecast’s horizon included in the terminal value would lead to a
goodwill impairment for Germany & France where it would lead to an impairment of 71M€ and 67M€ being recognized
respectively.

The only temporary difference which results in a material deferred tax balance relates to intangible assets. Other types
of temporary differences have been grouped into single categories of other deferred tax assets and liabilities.

At the end of the financial year, there were loss and interest carryforwards totaling 295.7 M€, of which interest
carryforwards amounted to 119.4 M€ (2021: 507.6 M€, of which interest carryforwards amounted to 311.5 M€). The
recognition of these assets, and the non-recognition of assets in respect of tax losses and interest carryforwards, is
based on the estimate of the Management Board of SYNLAB on the probability of being able to use these items (prior
to their expiration), including consideration of current levels of utilization, forecast operating results and the level of
deferred tax liabilities recognized in the particular territory / tax grouping. Deferred Tax Assets totaling 13.1 M€ (2021:
2.4 M€) have been recognized on losses. Deferred tax assets have not been recognized in respect of losses of 132.6
M€ (2021: 186.8 M€), which are available for indefinite carry forward. These losses have arisen mainly in the UK,
Spain, Germany and France. Whilst there is potential for the losses to be utilized against future taxable profits, no
deferred tax asset is recognized on the basis that it is not probable that the entities will generate taxable profits in
accordance with IAS 12.

The Group has also previously incurred interest expense in excess of the maximum available to be offset against
current profits in a number of territories. An amount of 119.4 M€ (2021: 311.5 M€) is available for indefinite carry
forward depending on local regulations, primarily in Spain, and France. The decrease compared to 2021 relates to a
change in our assessment on the use of interest carried forward in Germany. Deferred tax assets totaling 1.6 M€
(2021: 1.6 M€) have been recognized on excess interest amounts in companies in France which are forecasting excess
interest capacity. Deferred tax assets have not been recognized in respect of excess interest amounts of 113.1 M€
(2021: 305 M€) because excess interest capacity is not currently forecasted for future periods.

At 31 December 2022, the retained earnings of subsidiaries consolidated by the group include undistributed earnings
that will be subject to tax if remitted to the shareholder company. Deferred tax liabilities of 0.9 M€ (2021: 4.1 M€) were
recognized in 2022 for planned dividend payments by subsidiaries within the foreseeable future. No deferred tax liability
has been recognized on undistributed earnings of 10.7 M€.

#### 25. Trade accounts receivable

Net trade accounts receivable break down into the following Segments:


**As at 31 December 2022**


**€000** **Gross** **allowance** **Net**

Germany 107,088 (3,652) 103,436

France 79,593 (10,550) 69,043

South 196,983 (35,690) 161,293

**Total** **501,470** **(58,381)** **443,089**

There has been no change in the estimation techniques or significant assumptions made during the current reporting
period.

The Group writes off a trade receivable when there is information indicating that the debtor is in severe financial
difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, e.g. when the debtor has been placed under liquidation or has
entered into bankruptcy proceedings.

As a result of the billing processes and billing cycles in the various countries and businesses, there are 99.4 M€ (2021:
150.7 M€) of accrued income not yet billed to customers included in trade accounts receivables.

The ageing of trade accounts receivable at the reporting date was as follows:

The actual write-off relating to trade receivables as at 31 December 2022 amounts to 3.8 M€ (2021: 3.1 M€). There
was no material individual impairment of trade receivables.

The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk due to a large number of private customers and individually
non-significance of amounts due. The Group performs continuous credit evaluations of its receivables.

Trade receivables are exposed to a lower default risk, when they are less than 12 months past due. The provision
rates vary in this ageing group from 0.1% to 20% in exceptional cases. Trade receivables are considered to be exposed
to a higher default risk, when they are more than 12 months past due. The provision rates vary in this ageing group
from 60% to 90%.

Allowances for credit losses for trade accounts receivable are disclosed in the operating result. Subsequently incurred
credit losses and written-off amounts are recorded in the same income statement line.

#### 28. Employee benefits liabilities

Most of the Group’s employees are covered by state pension and collective plans managed by third parties if required
under local legislation. Those plans are defined contribution plans.

In addition to these statutory pension schemes, a provision for pensions and other post-employment benefits is
recorded in the IFRS consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022, 31 December 2021 based
on an actuarial expert opinion for the following obligations:

###### OBLIGATIONS IN SWITZERLAND

In general, employers in Switzerland must offer a pension plan to their employees in accordance with the Federal Law
on Occupational Retirement, Survivors’, and Disability Pension Plans (BVG). Employees whose salary exceeds a
particular threshold – which is redefined periodically – participate in the pension plan. The BVG requires a minimum
plan, the "BVG minimum", which must be covered in any case.

The Group’s pension plans in Switzerland are contribution-based plans with a guarantee of a minimum interest credit
and fixed conversion rates at retirement. The pension plans also provide benefits in case of disability and death. The
Group as a sponsoring employer is affiliated with various collective foundations and fulfils its legal obligation by means
of a defined benefit plan. Each collective foundation is responsible for the governance of the plan and the board is
composed of an equal number of representatives from the employers and employees chosen from all affiliated
companies.

Under the BVG, the pension plan must always be fully funded on a static basis. The Group is exposed to the risk that
in the case of a funding deficit, recovery measures must be taken which encompass additional financing through
employer or reduction of benefits (or both). Such a risk may occur in cases where the life expectancy of plan
participants is higher than expected. Furthermore, the underlying plan assets may develop differently than expected.

The Group pension obligations and ongoing service cost were calculated using the projected unit credit method,
applying a discount rate of 2.3% (2021: 0.4%) and a salary increase rate of 1.9% (2021: 1.2%) p.a. Staff turnover
assumptions are based on the demographic BVG 2020, (2021: BVG 2020). The individual values range from between
1.7% and 31.0%. Mortality, disability, and withdrawal probabilities were calculated in accordance with the new
demographic tables BVG 2020, CMI 1.3% (2021: BVG 2020, CMI 1.3%).

Long-services award commitments (“jubilee awards”) in Switzerland are based on collective or other agreements
granting employees long-term claims depending on their remuneration levels and duration of service. Provisions for
long-service awards were calculated applying a discount rate of 2.3% (2021: 0.4%), a salary increase rate of 1.9%
(2021: 1.2%), and a staff turnover rate per BVG 2020 of between 1.7% and 31.0%.

###### OBLIGATIONS IN FRANCE

In France, the Group provides retirement benefits, that are based on various collective bargaining agreements. The
corresponding plans are mostly fully unfunded. The Group is exposed to the risk that the salary increase could be
higher than expected. In France, the life expectancy is less important in terms of risk exposure given that the benefit
is paid as a lump sum.

Based on a collective agreement, a payment is granted to staff when they retire depending on their remuneration levels
and duration of service. Provisions were calculated based on the following actuarial assumptions: voluntary departure,
discount rate amounting to 4.0% (2021: 1.1%), inflation rate of 2.0% (2021: 2.0%), salary increase between 3.0%,
holding entities only 2.0% (2021: 2.0%) p.a., age at retirement phased depending on birth date with a maximum of 65
years for employees and 67 years for executives; social charge rate 47.5% (2021: 46.5%) and low staff turnover rate.

SYNLAB AG

###### OBLIGATIONS IN ITALY

Pursuant to statutory regulations (Trattamento di Fine Rapporto, TFR), employees are entitled to a one-time severance
payment when they leave the Company. The amounts depend on the employee’s term of service and salary level.
Provisions were calculated based on following actuarial assumptions: discount rate of 3.9% (2021 1.0%), inflation rate
of 2.0% (2021: 1.7%) and a salary increase of 1.5% (2021: 2.0%) p.a.

###### OTHER OBLIGATIONS

In certain other countries, there are legal obligations to make a one-time salary-based severance payment to a retiring
employee (Austria, Ecuador) or when they leave the Company (United Arab Emirates, Mexico). The Group also
assumed pension obligations from defined benefit plans for a few executive staff because of specific agreements in
Ecuador, Germany and the UK.

The sensitivity analyses above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on the defined
benefit obligation because of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period. The
sensitivity analyses are based on a change in a significant assumption, keeping all other assumptions constant. The
sensitivity analyses may not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that
changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another.

SYNLAB AG

#### 29. Share-based payment schemes

SYNLAB AG has set up various long-term, share-based payment schemes for the SYNLAB Group starting in the
financial year 2021. During the financial year 2022, new tranches under the existing programmes as well as a new
program, the employee participation programme (EPP), were granted. The grant dates were as follows:

1. LTIP (long-term incentive plan) for the Management Board, grant date: 1 May 2022

2. LTIP for senior executives, grant date: 1 May 2022

3. Virtual LTIP for employees, grant date: 1 May 2022

4. EPP for employees, grant dates: 7 January 2022 and 7 July 2022

According to the terms and conditions of the first three programmes, share-based commitments may in general be
settled in cash or in shares of SYNLAB AG (settlement option). However, the Supervisory Board and the Management
Board have determined in their respective resolutions that the settlement will be made through shares in SYNLAB AG.
Consequently, all three programmes are treated as equity-settled. The EPP program was defined as equity-settled in
its plan documentation.

Share-based commitments may be forfeited if the beneficiary's employment ends before the end of the vesting period.
The share-based commitments are subject to a vesting period of two to four years and grant an entitlement to
compensation which the beneficiaries will receive after the vesting period without making a payment.

During the valuation of the 2022 grants for the two LTIP programmes, it was noted that the definitions of the
programmes were not mathematically completely unambiguous. This was finally clarified by the Supervisory Board of
SYNLAB AG and resulted in a higher number of performance share units (PSU) for the Management Board and the
senior executives in connection with the 2021 grants. However, it did not change the total fair value of the programmes
or the expenses recorded in the 2021 financial statements. The changes were as follows:

**Updated calculation prepared** **Original calculation**
**in 2022** **prepared in 2021**

Number of PSUs Management Board 147,899 117,420

Number of PSUs senior executives 86,575 68,734

Weighted average fair value of a PSU € 13,86 € 17,46

The prior-year information below was adjusted accordingly where applicable.

LTIP for the Management Board

The awards are granted in the form of PSUs and are linked to performance criteria. For the share awards granted in
the past financial year, 40% of the target amount was linked to the development of SYNLAB's share price (total
shareholder return, TSR), and 60% of the target amount is linked to SYNLAB's relative share price development
compared to the development of the MSCI Europe Health Care Equipment & Services sector index (TSR target). The
range of target achievement of the individual performance criteria is from 0% to 300%. The vesting period is two years
(2021: three years). The fair value of these entitlements was 2.05 M€ (2021: 2.05 M€) and was determined based on
a Monte Carlo valuation model. The weighted average fair value of a PSU was 4.52 € (2021: 13.86 €). An expected

volatility of 30.0 % (2021: 30.0 %) and a price of 14.19 € per SYNLAB share (2021: 19.75 €) were used in this model.
The expected volatility was derived from historical volatilities. A risk-free interest rate of 0 % to 2.9 % (2021: 0.9 % to

- 0.6 %) and an expected dividend yield of 2.4 % (2021: 2.0 %) were applied. Assumptions on correlations between
the SYNLAB share price and the development of the MSCI Index were determined on the basis of historical price
developments.

LTIP for senior executives

The awards for senior executives are also linked to performance criteria. Both the determination or allocation of the
target amount and the determination of the fair value are identical to the LTIP for the Management Board. However,
the vesting period for this plan extends over four years (2021: four years). The fair value of these entitlements was
1.4 M€ (2021: 1.2 M€). The weighted average fair value of a PSU was also 4.52 € (2021: 13.86 €).

Virtual LTIP for employees

In the past financial year, 313,059 virtual share awards (2021: 271,490) were granted to various employees of the
SYNLAB Group. These are not linked to performance criteria but include a service criterion. The vesting period is four
years (2021: four years). The fair value of these entitlements amounted to 4.1 M€ (2021: 4.5 M€) and was determined
on the basis of a valuation model. The weighted average fair value of a virtual share award was 12.94 € (2021: 16.53 €).
A price of 14.19 € per SYNLAB share on the grant date (2021: 17.95 €), a risk-free interest rate of 0.6 % (2021: 0.6 %) and an expected dividend yield of 2.4 % (2021: 2.0 %) were used in this model.

EPP for employees

In the past financial year, 10,719 free shares were granted in connection with the first tranche (T1) and 11,729 free
shares were granted under the second tranche (T2) of the EPP program to employees of the SYNLAB Group. These
are not linked to performance criteria but include a service criterion. Following a modification of the programme during
the year, the vesting period is now two years instead of the originally planned three years. The fair value of these
entitlements amounted to 0.2 M€ (T1) and 0.2 M€ (T2) respectively and was determined on the basis of a valuation
model. The weighted average fair value of a virtual share award was 21 € (T1) and 16.12 € (T2). A price of 21.94 €
(T1) and 16.93 € (T2) per SYNLAB share on the grant date, a risk-free interest rate of -0.5 % (T1) and 0.9 % (T2) and
an expected dividend yield of 4.2 % (T1) and 6.6 % (T2) were used in this model.

The other provisions mainly relate to provisions for litigation. In the normal conduct of its business, the Group is involved
in legal proceedings relating to different matters: anti-trust, personnel, damages, and other claims with uncertainties
about the amount or timing of the outflows. According to management and as confirmed by legal counsel, the recorded
provision is considered to be sufficient to cover probable losses.

SYNLAB AG

#### 31. Litigations and Contingent liabilities

Group companies are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. To a large
extent, these concern professional liability and HR related matters, as well as inquiries from public authorities and
health insurance carriers regarding, among other things, billing modalities. Other than that, legal disputes of Group
companies in particular involve tax, social security, customs, data protection, regulatory, anti-trust and merger control
authorities and related topics. For the associated financial risks, provisions are made by the Group companies on a
case-by-case basis, if necessary, which are taken into account in the consolidated financial statements.

Additionally, the Group operates in a regulated industry. As such, in the ordinary course of business, the Group is
subject to national and local regulatory scrutiny, supervision and controls. There are no contingent liabilities recognised
as at the year ended 31 December 2022.

In the context of the external growth strategy of the new combined SYNLAB Group, contingent consideration may arise
in the scope of business combinations and is required to be recorded at fair value as at the date of acquisition. For
contingent consideration, that is dependent on the fulfilment of performance targets, especially earn-out arrangements,
the amount is recorded as purchase price contingent consideration whereas fixed amounts are recorded as payables
related to acquisitions of subsidiaries.

The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risks
and credit risk.

###### LIQUIDITY RISK

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is


-----

SYNLAB AG

to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both
normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
This planning considers the maturity of both its financial assets, and its projected cash flow from operations.

Typically, the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period
of 60 days, including the servicing of financial obligations. In addition, the Group maintains a line of credit (revolving
credit facility) under which drawings could be made for financing acquisitions or for general financing purposes. Refer
to Note 27 Borrowings and other financial liabilities for details on the maturities of financial indebtedness, as well as
for a description of the covenants in place with the RCF agreement. Under these covenants, the Group may be unable
to draw on the undrawn facility if it does not respect contractual requirements.

The Group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using a systematic liquidity planning scheme. This scheme considers
the maturity of its financial investments and assets, as well as the projected cash flows from operations.

The prospective liquidity analysis for non-derivative financial liabilities is as follows:

**Cash flow - remaining period**

###### MARKET RISK – INTEREST RATE RISK 

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, will affect the Group’s income or the value
of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk
exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.

SYNLAB AG

The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Term Loan tranches and
to the debt drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility (RCF).

As at the reporting date, the interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments was:


**As at 31 December**


**€000** **2022** **2021**

**Fixed-rate instruments**


Financial liabilities 692,453 617,060

**Variable-rate instruments**


Financial assets 541,684 443,747

Financial liabilities 1,421,039 1,409,760

Under the Group’s current financing strategy, Term Loans held by SYNLAB Bondco Plc bear floating interest at 6M
EURIBOR + 2.50% for a tranche of 320 M€ (TLB5) and 6M EURIBOR + 2.50% for a tranche of 385 M€ (TLB4). The
Term Loan held by SYNLAB AG (TLA) bear floating interest at 6M EURIBOR + 1.25% for a nominal amount of 735 M€.
The Group does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Due to the Group’s specific interest rate risk position based currently on a floating-rate funding structure, risk
management policies require the monitoring of interest rate changes.

Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments

From a cash perspective, all interest paid by SYNLAB on its financing debt instruments in 2022 was contractually
based on a EURIBOR reference rate set at zero. The currently ongoing 6M EURIBOR increase already had an impact
on the interest paid in 2022 and will increasingly impact the interest to be paid by SYNLAB in 2023.

On an annual basis, a 6M EURIBOR reference at 1% or an increase by 1% would have led to an overall additional
payment of 14.4 M€ on the Term Loans. If the RCF were to be drawn at its maximum amount of 485 M€, exposure to
interest risk rate on financial liabilities would amount to a 4.85 M€ for an increase in the variable interest rate of 100
basis points. That exposure to interest rate risk on financial liabilities would be partly compensated for by the positive
effect on financial income generated by cash equivalents, which are mostly based on variable-rate instruments. This
analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.

At the beginning of 2022, the Group entered into an interest rate hedging contract with the aim of containing the rise
in the EURIBOR base reference rate. In the event of an assumed increase of 6M EURIBOR reference of 1%, the
benefit of the hedging contract would have been 4.5 M€, decreasing the calculated additional interest payment from
14,4 M€ to 9.9 M€.

###### MARKET RISK – FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK 

The Group has been exposed to limited foreign exchange risk, given that the SYNLAB Group is so far mostly present
in European countries which are part of the Eurozone, except for the UK operations (which are exposed to foreign
exchange risk in respect of the British pound), the Swiss operations (which are exposed to the Swiss franc), certain
Northern or Eastern Europe countries, and the Rest of the World cash generating unit. Furthermore, the Group has
subsidiaries in Latin America, especially in Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Mexico, and is therefore exposed to foreign
exchange risk in respect of the Brazilian real, the Colombian peso, the Chilean peso and the Mexican peso. Non-euro

denominated total revenue represented, in aggregate, approximately 28% of the Group’s total revenue for the year
ended 31 December 2022.

The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency by
the year-end and adjusts their translation for a 5% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes
external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a
currency other than the currency of the lender or the borrower. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit
and 5% gain in the currency unit against the relevant currency. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a
change in CLP, BRL and GBP exchange rates with all other variables held constant. The Group’s exposure to
movements in all other currencies is not material.

###### CREDIT RISK

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet
its contractual obligations. It arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and investment securities.
Detailed quantitative information on credit risk is provided in Note 25 Trade accounts receivable.

###### TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. Due to the
large numbers of customers and individually immateriality of amounts due, the Group has no significant concentrations
of credit risks. The Group has adopted the simplified expected credit loss model for its trade receivables. The Group

always measures the loss allowance for trade receivable at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. To measure the expected
credit losses, trade accounts receivable have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days
past due. The computation of expected credit losses is performed by means of a default risk matrix, which is based on
the historical default rates grouped by trade receivable class and maturity buckets. Moreover, reasonable and
supportable information (if available without undue cost or effort) as at the reporting date about past events, current
conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions have been taken into account in the calculations. The amount
of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of
the respective financial instrument.

###### INVESTMENTS AND CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

The Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty. The Group limits its exposure to credit risk
by investing mainly in liquid securities with counterparties that have a high credit rating. Management actively monitors
its investments and does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit
risk at the reporting date was:


**As at 31 December**


**€000** **2022** **2021**

Trade accounts receivable 443,089 632,395

Other current assets 47,299 62,272

Cash and cash equivalents 541,684 443,747

Other non-current assets 80,519 44,050

**Total** **1,112,591** **1,182,464**

###### FAIR VALUES 

The basis for determining fair values is disclosed in Note 3 Determination of fair values.

Fair value of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis

Some of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting
period. They consist mainly of shares and other securities <20%, call options on non-controlling interests with an
agreed price determination formula, and contingent consideration recorded in a business combination (as detailed in
Note 32 Trade payables and other liabilities) which are all categorised within level 3 and for which fair values have
been usually determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on a discounted cash flow
analysis, with the most significant input being the discount rate that reflects the credit risk of counterparties. Embedded
derivatives that were separated from the host contract are categorised within level 2. The Bachelier model is used for
the valuation of the embedded derivatives; the main parameters are the nominal amount, the floor, the length of a
single floorlet, the risk-free interest rate, the EURIBOR forward rates as well as the volatility of the EURIBOR forward
rates.

Reconciliation of Level 2 fair value measurements

The total fair value gains or losses on embedded derivatives are disclosed in Note 12 Net finance costs.

Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements

The total fair value gains or losses on contingent consideration recognised in the statement of income are included in
the table below. The fair value of contingent consideration is mainly dependent on the results of the acquired entities
in a certain period after the acquisition and will be adjusted based on actual figures and amended projections. A higher
result will usually lead to higher contingent consideration, lower results will lead to lower contingent consideration. In
many cases, however, a certain bandwidth of possible outcomes is defined in the contracts, which limit the movement
of the contingent consideration. The total fair value gains or losses on contingent consideration recognised in the
statement of income are included in the specific aggregate acquisition-related expenses detailed in Note 5.

There were no transfers between Level 2 and 3 during the current or prior year.

The notional amount of financial instruments designated at fair value through profit and loss outstanding at the end of
the reporting period was (4.9) M€ (2021: 50.5 M€).

The Group measures derivative financial instruments, a non-controlling interest in a partnership (puts on NCI) and
contingent consideration recorded in business combinations at fair value through profit and loss.

The fair value of non-controlling interests in a partnership was measured based on the compensation formula set forth
in the partnership agreement and in consideration of the Company’s planning and market interest rates. The fair value
thus measured is therefore classifiable within level 3. The discounted cash flow method was used to capture the
present value of the expected future economic benefits that will flow out of the Group as a result of the contingent
consideration. The fair value arising from liabilities related to business combinations is derived from valuation
techniques and includes inputs that are not based on observable market data (level 3).

#### 37. Related party disclosures

According to IAS 24, related parties include those companies and persons where one person or company has the
ability to control the other party or exercise significant influence over its financial and operating policies. Significant
influence can be exercised in a number of ways, often through a seat on the management and/or supervisory body,
but also through intra-group transactions of significant size or the exchange of management personnel. Significant
influence can be established through shareholdings, bylaws or contractual agreements. In the case of share ownership,
significant influence is presumed in accordance with the requirements of IAS 28 if the shareholder directly or indirectly
holds 20 % or more of the voting rights, unless this presumption can be clearly rebutted. Significant influence is
irrefutably presumed if the policy of the company can be influenced, for example, by a corresponding appointment to
the supervisory bodies.

Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries and between subsidiaries have been eliminated on
consolidation and are not discussed in this note.

With regard to SYNLAB AG and the SYNLAB Group, Cinven is able to exercise significant influence due to its
shareholding (via Cinven Capital Management (V) General Partner Limited and Ephios Luxembourg S.à r.l.,
Luxembourg, the Company's largest shareholder). Cinven and other significant shareholders are therefore to be
classified as a related party.

SYNLAB AG prepares the consolidated financial statements for the largest and the smallest group of companies to
which the Company belongs as parent company. These consolidated financial statements are filed with the electronic
Federal Gazette.

**Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) in the German language on the German version of the consolidated**

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

To SYNLAB AG, Munich/Germany

**REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF THE GROUP**
**MANAGEMENT REPORT**

**Audit Opinions**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of SYNLAB AG, Munich/Germany, and its subsidiaries (the

Group) which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2021, the consolidated statement of profit
and loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated

statement of cash flows for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2021, and the notes to the
consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have

audited the group management report of SYNLAB AG, Munich/Germany, for the financial year from 1 January to
31 December 2021. In accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the

consolidated corporate governance statement included in section 7 of the group management report.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRS as adopted by
the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB and, in
compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the
Group as at 31 December 2021 and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to
31 December 2021, and

- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position. In
all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements,
complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future
development. Our audit opinion of the group management report does not include an opinion on the content of
the consolidated corporate governance statement and the separate combined non-financial group report,
referenced in the group management report.

Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 German Commercial Code (HGB), we declare that our audit has not led to
any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group
management report.

SYNLAB AG

**Group Management Report**
**As at 31 December 2021**

**Basis for the Audit Opinions**

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance
with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014; referred to subsequently as “EU Audit
Regulation”) and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits
promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles
are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of
the Group Management Report” section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in
accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have
fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in

accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit
services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have

obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial
statements and on the group management report.

**Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the
consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2021. These matters were

addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our audit
opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.

In the following we present the key audit matters we have determined in the course of our audit:

1. Recoverability of goodwill

2. Capital reorganisation as part of a non-cash capital increase

3. Requirement for estimates in connection with the determination and cut-off of realised revenue in Germany

Our presentation of these key audit matters has been structured as follows:

a) description (including reference to corresponding information in the consolidated financial statements)

b) auditor’s response


-----

SYNLAB AG

**Group Management Report**
**As at 31 December 2021**

**1. Recoverability of goodwill**

a) As at 31 December 2021, goodwill totals mEUR 2,440 (31 Dec. 2020: mEUR 2,212), which overall include four
cash-generating-units (“CGU”) and groups of CGUs, respectively.

As at 31 December 2021, the executive directors of the parent company carried out impairment tests of
goodwill in compliance with IAS 36 (impairment of assets), by means of a detailed measurement of the value
in use of the CGUs and CGU groups, respectively, by using the discounted cash flow model. The
determination of the value in use is based on the planning of SYNLAB AG’s executive directors, which
consists of a three-year plan (budget for 2022 and strategic medium-term planning 2023 to 2024) as well as a
projection for two more years, which is continued with assumptions on long-term growth rates. In this case, the

budget and the medium-term planning are approved by the supervisory board and the executive board,
respectively.

In so doing, the executive directors concluded that there is no need for impairment.

The result of the impairment tests highly depends on the executive directors’ assessment of future cash
inflows to the respective CGUs and CGU groups as well as of the discount rate (weighted average cost of

capital) and hence is subject to significant uncertainty. This issue was of particular importance within the
scope of our audit considering the existing uncertainties and discretionary scope and due to the complexity of

the measurement model the measurement was based on.

Information provided by the executive directors of the parent company on the recoverability of goodwill as well
as their impairment tests are included in sections 2.6 and 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial

statements.

b) First, we developed an understanding of the relevant methods the executive directors applied as well as of the
assumptions and data sources used relating to the measurement of goodwill. This also included the manner
and ways of ascertaining the planning figures for future cash inflows as well as ascertaining the discount rates.


-----

SYNLAB AG

**Group Management Report**
**As at 31 December 2021**

According to our audit strategy we have conducted scaled audit procedures in accordance with our risk
assessment. Our risk assessment was primarily based on headroom and sensitivity analyses. Our audit
procedures, which were conducted step-by-step, are described below. When conducting the impairment tests,
we integrated internal measurement specialists into our audit team. With their help, we audited whether the
essential parameters used during the calculations such as for example the used discount rates and
sustainable growth rates in the perpetual pension as well as the planned cash inflows were appropriate, by
comparing these values with the multi-year budget figures for 2022 to 2026 adopted by the executive directors
as well as by checking the plausibility of the measurement assumptions made based on general and industryspecific market forecasts and expectations as well as publicly available forecasts from financial analysts
regarding SYNLAB AG. Apart from that, we examined the accuracy of the forecasts over time. We scrutinised
the planned revenues using internal evidence and provided information as well as publicly available external
market assessments all the while considering internal and publicly available external sources regarding their
assessment on the development of the coronavirus pandemic and its economic impact.

In addition, we examined the allocation of corporate assets and corporate costs to the CGUs and CGU
groups, respectively. Considering that even relatively small changes of the discount rate may have a
significant impact on the determined amount of the Company’s value, we also made the parameters used to
determine each discount rate (WACC) including the resulting weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
plausible based on own control and comparison calculations, respectively.

Finally, we examined the information provided by the executive directors in the notes to the consolidated

financial statements regarding the measurement of goodwill as well as the information provided on the
impairment tests with regard to their completeness and compliance with the requirements of IAS 36.

**2. Capital reorganisation as part of a non-cash capital increase**

a) SYNLAB AG was established as a ready-made company under the company “ISARSMARAGD AG”. After
Ephios Luxembourg S.à.r.l., Luxembourg/Luxembourg, obtained any and all shares, the articles of association

were amended by resolution of the general meeting held on 11 January 2021. The commercial register was
notified of the new establishment from an economic perspective on 4 March 2021. The company
ISARSMARAGD AG was renamed to SYNLAB AG by resolution of the general meeting held on 18 March
2021.

A non-cash capital increase was carried out by resolution of the extraordinary general meeting held on 27 April
2021. This capital increase was achieved by the former shareholders of SYNLAB Limited, London/Great
Britain, contributing their respective shares in SYNLAB Limited to SYNLAB AG as part of a contribution
agreement in exchange for the corresponding number of new shares in SYNLAB AG. As of this point in time,
SYNLAB AG consequently has to be regarded as parent company of SYNLAB Group. SYNLAB AG’s
shareholder structure after the contribution in kind is identical to the former shareholder structure of SYNLAB
Limited.


-----

SYNLAB AG

**Group Management Report**
**As at 31 December 2021**

The executive directors characterised this non-cash capital increase as capital reorganisation. Hence, as of
27 April 2021, any and all assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated financial statements of SYNLAB
Limited were transferred to the consolidated financial statements of SYNLAB AG and continued at their
carrying amounts (including comparative values as at 31 December 2020). Moreover, the consolidated
financial statements of SYNLAB AG for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 do not only include
income and expenses for SYNLAB Group as of the date of the contribution of the shares on 27 April 2021, but
they rather include SYNLAB Group’s income and expenses for the entire calendar year from 1 January to
31 December 2021 (including comparative values for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2020).

In so doing, the question arose whether the regulations of IFRS 3 (business combinations) had to be applied

or if the matter had to be classified as a transaction under common control for which the IFRS 3 regulations
are not applicable.

In case the IFRS 3 do not apply, the IFRS do not contain any specific regulations on the recognition of such

transactions in the balance sheet. In this case, according to IAS 8 (accounting policies, changes in accounting
estimates and errors), an accounting method would have to be developed and applied, providing relevant and

reliable information to the users of the financial statements for their economic decision-making process. This
would also entail the question how to present the reporting period and the comparative period for the

consolidated financial statements of SYNLAB AG for the financial year ended 31 December 2021.

In light of the potential lack of explicit IFRS regulations for the presentation of the transaction in the balance
sheet, existing discretionary scope and the significance for understanding the assets, liabilities, financial

position and financial performance of the Group for the users of the consolidated financial statements due to
the complexity of this matter, it was of particular importance during our audit.

Information provided by the parent company’s executive directors regarding the capital reorganisation are
included in section 1 of the notes to the financial statements.

b) While auditing this matter, we integrated internal IFRS specialists into our audit team. Within the scope of our
audit procedure, we examined to which extent the matter classifies as a reversed acquisition or as a business
combination under common control and whether the IFRS 3 have to be applied. Afterwards, we acknowledged
to which extent the executive directors developed and applied an accounting method providing relevant and
reliable information to the users of the consolidated financial statements for their economic decision-making
process.

For this reason, we have obtained an understanding of the internal documentation and the corresponding
explanations provided by the Company regarding the chosen accounting method and we have critically
reviewed and acknowledged the contractual bases (contribution agreement) and the resolutions of the general
meetings as well as further documents and evidence, the capital measures taken and implemented were
based on. Furthermore, we discussed applicable legal balance-sheet related literature and professional legal

directives as well as obtained expert knowledge from internal IFRS specialists we contacted and evaluated the
gathered information and facts.


-----

SYNLAB AG

**Group Management Report**
**As at 31 December 2021**

Based on the result of the assessment of the approach chosen by SYNLAB AG’s executive directors to
represent the transaction as a capital reorganisation and hence outside of the regulations of IFRS 3 in
accordance with IAS 8 para. 10 et seq., we reviewed the transfer of the values from the consolidated financial
statements of SYNLAB Limited as well as the information provided by the executive directors of the parent
company in the notes to the consolidated financial statements regarding the capital reorganisation.

**3. Requirement for estimates in connection with the determination and cut-off of realised revenue in**
**Germany**

a) The Group generates revenue with a wide range of clinical laboratory and medical diagnostic services for
insurance companies, hospitals, individuals, pharmacies and national health organisations. These services are

primarily provided in the area of human medicine but are also provided in the area of veterinary medicine.

On the one hand, the agreed accounting modalities are based on the respective country-specific conditions for
publicly regulated healthcare systems as well as on individual agreements concluded with any natural person
or legal entity outside of the publicly regulated healthcare system on the other hand. The accounting
processes resulting from the complex accounting laws – particularly in Germany – require estimates be made
to a significant extent at the end of the financial year when determining and cutting-off realised revenue.

In Germany, significant revenue estimates are necessary in the following areas:

i) Realisation of revenue in connection with tests performed but not yet finally billed.

These revenues are subject to risks regarding their measurement as assumptions on the determination of
average prices are to be made. When budgets are agreed upon, assumptions for forecasts for the
budgeted period have to be calculated additionally due to regular pricing depending on the volume.
Moreover, when dealing with regulated prices, assumptions on the consideration of billing restrictions need
to be considered. These estimates are particularly complex, especially in the German part of the Group,
due to the multitude of existing regulations.

ii) Revenue and quotes for services, respectively, that are billed via the public health insurance’s system
depend on doctors’ performance requirements in connection with set budgets public health insurance
companies have in due consideration of the according restriction instruments, which are only determined
well after the service has been rendered. The estimate is made considering historic information and values
as well as current expectations the executive directors have.

The Group revenue for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 includes cut-off revenue of mEUR 235.7.
Based on the estimate, the revenue share in Germany amounts to mEUR 178.8.


-----

SYNLAB AG

**Group Management Report**
**As at 31 December 2021**

This matter constitutes a key audit matter from our point of view, as a large extent of judgement is necessary
regarding the executive directors’ estimates and the results of these estimates are significant for the financial
statements overall. In light of the existing discretionary scopes and due to the complexity of the determining
methods and models, which served as basis, this matter was of particular importance during our audit.

Information provided by the parent company’s executive directors on estimates when determining and cutting
off of revenue are included in sections 2.6 and 3 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

b) We tested the design and implementation of accounting-related internal controls and the general IT controls
from selected laboratory information, billing and accounting systems as well as regarding estimated revenues.
In addition, we developed an understanding of the relevant methods, assumptions and data sources used by
the executive directors regarding the estimated revenues. In order to assess the quality of the estimates in the
past, we have conducted retrospective analyses while critically assessing deviations. In so doing, we
conducted the following audit procedures all the while maintaining professional judgement: Validation with
average prices, that we have ascertained ourselves from the billed population, plausibility checks based on
historic information and on external market data, regulations and agreements as well as understanding the
executive directors’ billing method.

**Other Information**

The executive directors and the supervisory board are responsible for the other information. The other information

comprises:

- the report of the supervisory board,

- the separate combined non-financial group report pursuant to Sec. 315b and 315c HGB, referenced in the group
management report, which will probably be provided to us after the date of this Independent Auditor’s Report,

- the consolidated corporate governance statement included in the group management report,

- the executive directors’ confirmation regarding the consolidated financial statements and the group management
report pursuant to Section 297 (2) sentence 4 and Section 315 (1) sentence 5 HGB, and

- all other parts of the annual report,

- but not the consolidated financial statements, neither the audited content of the group management report, nor
our auditor’s report thereon.

The supervisory board is responsible for the report of the supervisory board. The executive directors and the
supervisory board are responsible for the statement pursuant to Section 161 AktG regarding the German Corporate
Governance Code, which is included in the consolidated corporate governance statement, which in turn is part of the
group management report (section 7). Other than that, the executive directors are responsible for the other
information.


-----

SYNLAB AG

**Group Management Report**
**As at 31 December 2021**

Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the
other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion
thereon.

In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, to
consider whether the other information

- is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report or our
knowledge obtained in the audit, or

- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

**Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial**

**Statements and the Group Management Report**

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all
material respects, with IFRS as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law
pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these
requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the
Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined
necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related
to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of
accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic
alternative but to do so.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that as a
whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the
consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the
opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such
arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group
management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide
sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.

The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

SYNLAB AG

**Group Management Report**
**As at 31 December 2021**

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group**
**Management Report**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a
whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the
consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal
requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an
auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group
management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards
for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material
misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.

We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also

- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group
management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those

risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud

may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.

- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of

arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on

the effectiveness of these systems.

- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of
estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

- conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that
may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of
our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as
a going concern.


-----

SYNLAB AG

**Group Management Report**
**As at 31 December 2021**

- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in
a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial
position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and with the
additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB.

- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities
within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group
management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We
remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.

- evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its

conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

- perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group

management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant
assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper

derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on
the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that

future events will differ materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we
identify during our audit.

We provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence
requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to
bear on our independence, and where applicable, the related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the current period and are therefore the key audit
matters. We describe these matters in the auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about
the matter.

SYNLAB AG

**Group Management Report**
**As at 31 December 2021**

In addition, the executive directors of the Company are responsible for such internal controls that they have
considered necessary to enable the preparation of ESEF documents that are free from material intentional or
unintentional non-compliance with the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section 328 (1)
HGB.

The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part of the
financial reporting process.

**Group Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the ESEF Documents**

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from material
intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB. We exercise professional
judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also

- identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of

Section 328 (1) HGB, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit on the ESEF documents in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion

on the effectiveness of these controls.

- evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e. whether the provided file containing the ESEF

documents meets the requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the
balance sheet date, on the technical specification for this electronic file.

- evaluate whether the ESEF documents enable a XHTML reproduction with content equivalent to the audited
consolidated financial statements and to the audited group management report.

- evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance with
the requirements of Articles 4 and 6 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the
balance sheet date, enables an appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML
reproduction.

**Further information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation**

We were elected as Group auditor by the general meeting on 6 April 2021. We were engaged by the supervisory

**Group Management Report**
**As at 31 December 2021**

**OTHER MATTER – USE OF THE AUDITOR’S REPORT**

Our auditor’s report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited
group management report as well as with the audited ESEF documents. The consolidated financial statements and
the group management report converted into the ESEF format – including the versions to be published in the Federal

SYNLAB AG

#### 1. Reporting entity

The consolidated financial statements were prepared by SYNLAB Aktiengesellschaft (hereinafter: “AG” and “the
Company”), the ultimate parent company of the SYNLAB Group. The Group consolidated financial statements as at
and for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2021 consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries
(together referred to as the “Group” and individually as “Group entities”) and include the Group’s interest in associates.

The SYNLAB Group is the largest European private supplier of medical diagnostic services, primarily involved in clinical
diagnostics testing and screening services. The Group, which is based in Germany, employs approximately 30,000
people and benefits from a pan-European network across 36 countries. The Group is currently active in Austria,
Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland,
France, Germany, Ghana, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Mexico, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Panama, Peru,
Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, U.A.E., Ukraine and the United
Kingdom. The address of SYNLAB AG is Moosacher Straße 88, 80809 Munich, Germany.

During the extraordinary general meeting of SYNLAB AG on 27 April 2021, the Company’s share capital was increased
by way of a non-cash capital increase. The registration of the non-cash capital increase in the Commercial Register
was effective on 28 April 2021. During this transaction the shares of SYNLAB Limited, London, United Kingdom, were
contributed to SYNLAB AG. SYNLAB Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in the United
Kingdom under the Companies Act and is registered under the number 09630775 (England and Wales) and has its
registered address in London, United Kingdom. With this transaction SYNLAB AG became the new ultimate parent of
the SYNLAB Group.

At the time of the contribution SYNLAB AG did not have any own business or operations. Additionally, the shareholders
of SYNLAB AG were the same as for SYNLAB Limited before. Therefore, this transaction was a transaction under
common control (IFRS 3.2(c)) and IFRS 3 Business Combinations is not applicable. This transaction is classified as a
pure capital reorganisation under IFRS accounting and the predecessor approach is applied. Following this approach,
the consolidated financial statements of the entity SYNLAB Limited are carried over and the 2020 consolidated financial
statements of SYNLAB Limited are used as comparative financial statements for the 2021 consolidated financial
statements of SYNLAB AG.. SYNLAB Limited Group financials are available at the website of UK Companies House
(https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09630775/filing-history).

The Company’s ultimate parent company during the majority of the year 2021 was Cinven Capital Management (V)
General Partner Limited. Due to a reduction in shareholdings, Cinven Capital Management (V) General Partner Limited
is no longer the ultimate parent company after November 25, 2021.

#### 2. Basis of preparation

Due to rounding, numbers presented throughout this and other documents may not add up precisely to the totals
provided and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.

###### 2.1 Statement of compliance

The consolidated financial statements relate to SYNLAB AG, Munich, Germany (commercial register number HRB
246540), and its subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union (EU), and the additional
requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315 e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The
consolidated financial statements comply with IFRS as published by the International Accounting Standards Board
(IASB). The consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Management Board on March 15, 2022.
SYNLAB prepares and publishes the consolidated financial statements in euros (€)

###### 2.2 IFRS basis adopted

From 1 January 2021, the following new standards and amendments are effective and did not have a material impact
on the Group’s consolidated Financial Statements:

    - Reference rate reform - phase 2 (amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16)

    - Amendment to the references in the standards to the financial reporting framework.

    - COVID-19 Related Rental Concessions after 30June 2021 (Amendment to IFRS16)

2.2.2 New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet applicable

A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31
December 2021, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.

    - References to the Framework (Amendments to IFRS 3) with amendments to IFRS 3 Business
Combinations

    - Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37)

    - Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards - 2018-2020 Cycle

    - Amendments to IFRS 17

    - Deferred Taxes on Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12)

    - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1)

The directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial
statements of the Group in future periods.

###### 2.3 Basis of measurement 

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following items
in the statement of financial position:


-----

SYNLAB AG

- derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and

- certain long-term financial assets are measured at fair value.

###### 2.4 Functional and presentation currency

These consolidated financial statements are presented in euro, which is the Company’s functional currency. All
financial information presented in euro has been rounded to the nearest thousand.

###### 2.5 Going Concern

The financial statements of the Group have been prepared on a going concern basis.

At 31 December 2021, the Group had net assets of 2,255.7M€ (31 December 2020: 1,203.6M€) and net current assets
of 356.8 M€ (31 December 2020: 853.8 M€). The group reported an operating cash flow for the year ended 31
December of 2021 1,011.7 Mio.€ (31. December 2020: 520.4 Mio.€), cash flow from investing activities -381.0 M€ (31
December 2020 : 421.1 M€), cash flow from financing activities -1,104.1 M€ (31 December 2020 : -261.8 M€) and
cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period 443.5 M€ (31 December 2020: 904.7 M€).

The Directors consider the going concern basis to be appropriate following their assessment of the Group’s financial
position and its ability to meet its obligations as and when they fall due. The Directors have also considered the wider
operational consequences and ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic:

Testing and particularly medical testing is a resilient and defensive market, which has historically had limited impact
from past economic or capital market downturns.

SYNLAB business assumptions about COVID-19 testing are as follows: a long-term view that an endemic virus could
generate around 150 M€ of testing revenue on an annual basis and a shorter-term view that additional use cases (such
as track & trace, safe at work, immunity testing, …) represent 350 M€ of additional revenue. SYNLAB can use its
existing capacity -already mostly amortized- to perform the testing in relation to these revenue levels. The Group will
maintain a certain COVID-19 capacity as long as medically necessary and will adjust capacity if COVID-19 volumes
are durably lower.

###### 2.6 Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of the consolidated Group financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates
and assumptions in applying the Group’s accounting policies to determine the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various
other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions to accounting
estimates applied prospectively.

**2.6.1 Critical accounting judgements**
In applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has applied judgement in the following areas that have a
significant impact on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.

###### LEASES

The evaluation whether or not the exercise / non-exercise of purchase or extension / termination options is “reasonably
certain” may require substantial judgement.


-----

SYNLAB AG

The Group reassess whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination
option, upon the occurrence of either a significant event or a significant change in circumstances that:

- is within the control of the lessee; and

- affects whether the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option not previously included in its determination
of the lease term, or not to exercise an option previously included in its determination of the lease term.

The Group revise the lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a lease. For example, the noncancellable period of a lease will change if one of the following occurs:

- the lessee exercises an option not previously included in the entity’s determination of the lease term;

- the lessee does not exercise an option previously included in the entity’s determination of the lease term;

- an event occurs that contractually obliges the lessee to exercise an option not previously included in the entity’s
determination of the lease term; or

- an event occurs that contractually prohibits the lessee from exercising an option previously included in the entity’s
determination of the lease term.

The lease term may also be revised following a reassessment as to whether an extension option is reasonably certain
to be exercised, or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised.

###### BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Parent Company, and each of those
companies over which it exercises control. Control over an entity exists when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over
the entity. When the Group has less than a majority of voting or similar rights in an entity, the Group considers all
relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an entity, including the contractual
arrangements, and voting rights and potential voting rights. The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an entity
if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to the elements of control. This assessment is key in certain
jurisdictions where the regulations governing the ownership and certification of laboratories require the Group to hold
each clinical laboratory or a limited number of the clinical laboratories through a separate subsidiary. Certain countries
also regulate the corporate form through which laboratories may be held, such as “MVZs” (Medizinisches
Versorgungszentrum) in Germany and “SELs” (société d’exercice libéral) in France. See Note 3 Basis of consolidation
policy for further information.

**2.6.2 Key sources of estimation**

Information about assumptions and estimation concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation at the
reporting date, that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next financial year are included
in the following notes.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

###### REVENUE ESTIMATION

The Group earns revenues from a wide range of analysis and diagnostic testing services, which are invoiced to a range
of customers including insurance companies, hospitals, individuals, pharmacies, and National Heath organisations.
The most significant areas of revenue estimation in the Group relate to:


-----

SYNLAB AG

a) revenue recognised based on as yet, unconfirmed public health budgets, where revenue is estimated based on
historical patterns together with other publicly available information (Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Spain being
the most significant segments of the business impacted); and

b) accrued revenue based on complete but unbilled tests, where the calculation of the value of those tests include a
level of estimation based on

  - pricing mechanisms as agreed during contract negotiations and used to calculate average prices;

  - historical experience; and

  - actual work performed (e.g. analyses completed).

Based on historical data and experience, the measures are reliable and the economic benefits associated with the
revenue recognised based on these measures are probable to flow to the entity.

Please refer to Note 3 for further details.

###### GOODWILL AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL

The Group determines on an annual basis whether goodwill is impaired. The determination as to whether goodwill has
been impaired involves estimation of the key inputs in the impairment process including:

- the forecast cash flows and management assumptions for revenue growth and EBITDA margin used in making the
determinations which are based on financial budgets covering a five year period;

- the key assumptions in calculating the discount rates applied to each cash generating unit or group of cash
generating units (“CGUs”), in particular the risk free rate, equity risk premium, size premium and tax rates which
are used in the calculation; and

- the terminal growth rates applied to each of the CGUs.

Please refer to Note 17 Goodwill.

###### ACQUISITIONS

Acquisition accounting involves estimation in determining the fair value of the intangible assets through a purchase
price allocation assumed in a business combination and the fair value of the consideration payable. The key areas of
estimation include:

- estimates in accounting for any unusual terms and conditions in the respective share purchase agreement (“SPA”),
including contingent consideration. These amounts are contingent on the acquired business meeting agreed
performance targets. At the date of the acquisition, the Group reviews the profit and cash forecasts for the acquired
business and estimates the amount of contingent consideration that is likely to be due. See Note 31 Trade Payables
and other Liabilities; and

- the key assumptions within the fair value calculation of the intangible assets through a purchase price allocation,
specifically the discount rates, revenue growth rates and future cash flow forecasts.

Please refer to Note 4 Significant events and Note 18 Intangible assets.


-----

SYNLAB AG

###### PENSION AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS

The determination of pension and other post-employment benefit obligations and expenses for defined benefit plans
is dependent on a number of estimates and assumptions, including the discount rate and future mortality rate. The
changes in assumptions and actuarial estimates may affect the benefit obligation, future expense and future cash flow.
Refer to Notes 3 and 27.

#### 3. Significant accounting policies

The accounting policies adopted for the preparation of the IFRS consolidated financial statements of SYNLAB AG are
described below.

The accounting policies have been applied consistently by Group entities and have not changed from those applied in
the 2020 consolidated financial statements of SYNLAB Limited. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out
below.

**BASIS OF ACCOUNTING**

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial
instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies
below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and
services.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or
estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into
account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account
when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in
these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions
that are within the scope of IFRS 2, leasing transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 16, and measurements that
have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in IAS 2 or value in use in IAS 36.

In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the
degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair
value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:

- Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can
access at the measurement date;

- Level 2 inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly or indirectly; and

- Level 3 unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, notably SYNLAB's own data.


-----

SYNLAB AG

**BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by
the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved when the Company direct or
indirect:

- has the power over the investee;

- is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee; and

- has the ability to use its power to affects its returns.

When the Company direct or indirect has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it considers that it has
power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities
of the investee unilaterally. The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not
the Company's voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including:

- the size of the Company's holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote
holders;

- potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties;

- rights arising from other contractual arrangements including articles of association, shareholders agreement; and

- any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Company has, or does not have, the current ability to
direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made.

Regulations governing the ownership and certification of laboratories in certain jurisdictions require the Group to hold
each clinical laboratory or a limited number of the clinical laboratories through a separate subsidiary. Certain countries
also regulate the corporate form through which laboratories may be held, such as “MVZs” (Medizinisches
Versorgungszentrum) in Germany and “SELs” (société d’exercice libéral) in France.

In France, the Group is subject to regulatory constraints on the ownership of share capital and voting rights of SELs
operating clinical laboratories by persons other than laboratory doctors and laboratory companies. Indeed laboratory
doctors practising in the SEL should have the majority of voting rights and the majority of the share capital since the
French law on medical biology adopted on 30 May 2013 (which includes a grandfathering clause for existing SELs,
which are operating under a different ownership structure with the majority of their share capital held by laboratory
companies as of the date of enactment). To comply with such regulatory constraints, the Group has put in place a
specific corporate structure pursuant to which, and subject to a few exceptions, the Group, directly or indirectly, hold
the maximum % of shares authorised by the law (up to 99.9% of share capital for historical SELs owned before May
2013 and 49.9% of share capital for SELs acquired since May 2013) while some of the laboratory doctors practising
in said SEL hold the remaining shares. However, in all instances, the Group has been granted substantially all of the
economic rights which is implemented through the issuance of preferred shares when laboratory doctors practicing in
said SEL hold more than 50% of the share capital. The Group has therefore put in place mechanisms that grant it
substantially all of the economic rights in such SELs and allow it to control the relevant activities, in accordance with
the French regulatory framework, and fully consolidate its French network. The control exercised over French
subsidiaries is based on specific governance mechanisms and contractual agreements with laboratory doctors
practicing in the SEL, qualified by the Group as de facto control.

In Germany, due to German fee regulations, local physicians outsource a wide range of laboratory procedures to
medical collaborative laboratories (“CLs”), which may also be responsible for billing. The sole shareholders of such
CLs are local physicians co-operating to provide the required services in an economically viable way. The SYNLAB


-----

SYNLAB AG

Group as a laboratory services provider thus sometimes has to cooperate based on contractual agreements with these
CLs to render services. As a consequence of these contracts most of the benefits from the CL’s business operations
accrue to the Group, i.e. the Group has put in place mechanisms that grant it the majority of the economic rights in
such CLs and allow it to control the relevant activities, in accordance with the German regulatory framework. The
Group therefore considers it has control over the CLs even though it does not legally own a shareholding and fully
consolidates those entities.

The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that
control commences until the date that it ceases.

All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between the
members of the Group are eliminated on consolidation.

The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are
changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.

Non-controlling interests (“minority interests”) represent the part of total income or loss, and of total equity not held by
the Group and are identified separately from the amounts attributable to the owners of the Company in the Income
Statement, Statement of Comprehensive Income, Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Financial Position.

Those interests of minority interests that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share
of net assets upon liquidation may initially be measured at fair value or at the minority interests’ proportionate share of
the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-byacquisition basis. For medical biology companies, whether controlled de jure or de facto, minority interests of other
shareholders, i.e. laboratory doctors, must be assessed based on the financial rights attached to their shares rather
than the % of share capital or voting rights. The Group has an immaterial amount of minority interests.

**BUSINESS COMBINATIONS**

Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired,
are accounted for using the acquisition method at the acquisition date, being the date on which control is obtained.
The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of
the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners
of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related
costs, such as finder’s fees, legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional and consulting fees are expensed
as incurred and are presented in a dedicated aggregate “acquisition and disposal related items” line in the other
operating expenses section within the consolidated statement of income.

The Group measures goodwill as the difference between: (a) the sum of (i) the fair value of the consideration
transferred, (ii) the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquire, (iii) the acquisition date fair value
of any previously held interest in the acquired business; and (b) the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date.

If at the reporting date the fair values of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities can only
be established provisionally, then these values are used. If we obtain new information within twelve months of the
acquisition date, these fair value adjustments are treated as adjustments to goodwill. Knowledge of facts and
circumstances that existed at the acquisition date is recognized in the consolidated income statements.


-----

SYNLAB AG

When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes an asset or liability resulting from
a contingent consideration arrangement (e.g. earn out), the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisitiondate fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a business combination. Any subsequent
changes after closing date are recognised in profit or loss and are presented in the dedicated aggregate “Acquisitions
related expenses” line. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not re-measured.

A contingent liability assumed in a business combination is recognised only if such a liability represents a present
obligation and arises from a past event, and its fair value can be measured reliably.

Acquisitions and disposal of non-controlling interests

Acquisitions and/or disposal of non-controlling interests are accounted for as a transaction with equity holders in their
capacity as equity holders. Therefore no goodwill is recognised or derecognised as a result of such transactions.

Acquisitions of achieved in stages

When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously-held interests in the acquired entity is
remeasured to its acquisition date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss.

Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 are measured in accordance
with that Standard.

**GOODWILL**

Goodwill is initially recognised and measured as set out above.

Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing,
goodwill is allocated to each of the group of CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cashgenerating units and groups of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more
frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.

If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first
to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on
the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed
in a subsequent period.

For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting
purposes corresponds to the CGUs described in Note 16 Goodwill. On disposal of a cash-generating unit, the
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

**INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES**

An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence, which is the power to participate in the financial
and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.

The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity
method of accounting. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognied in the consolidated
statement of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group's share of the profit or loss and
other comprehensive income of the associate. Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in an
associate is not recognised separately. When the Group's share of losses of an associate exceeds the Group's interest


-----

SYNLAB AG

in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group's net investment in
the associate), the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to
the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or losses are made.

When a group entity transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with
the associate are recognised in the Group's consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the
associate that are not related to the Group.

**REVENUE**

The Group earns revenues from a wide range of analysis and diagnostic testing services, which are invoiced to
insurance companies, hospitals, individuals, pharmacies, and National Health entities.

Those services include mainly analysis and diagnostic testing services for human medicine with notably the clinical
biological testing, including routine and specialty tests (esoteric), anatomical pathology, histological or cytological
testings and the diagnostic imaging using medical and molecular imaging technologies, but also testing services for
veterinary medicine.

The Group applies the principles set out in IFRS 15 for revenue recognition by using the following five steps:

1. Identify the contract(s) with a customer.
2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
3. Determine the transaction price.
4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.
5. Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

In general, contracts with customers are clustered in major revenue streams and their substreams. The revenue
recognition is outlined below for each separately.

Usually, the activities performed to generate revenues might include e.g. logistics, analytics and the provision of a
result. However, the service promised to the customer is an analysis (even for multiple parameters), i.e. the combined
output of the several activities, which are either not capable of being distinct or not distinct within the context of the
contract (due to high interrelation). As a result, each contract (order) has only one performance obligation.

For the determination of the transaction price the nature, timing and amount of consideration promised by a customer
are taken into account, and - if applicable – also variable consideration, significant financing components and noncash consideration. Amounts collected on behalf of third parties are excluded.

**Human medicine**

_Health insurance funds_

Generally, the contractual basis for the revenue from health insurance funds comes from frame contracts and/or from
regulatory rulings that define general terms and conditions that are applied to individual orders to perform an analysis.

The basis for remuneration with respect to revenues differs by country, type of analysis and/or contract type. For
contracts that – despite fixed prices per analysis- contain elements that cause variability such as e.g. volume based
discounts, allocated budgets/caps, quotation rates, the amount of consideration will be estimated based on the
expected value and historical experience.


-----

SYNLAB AG

The (estimated) transaction price per analysis is recognised once the results of the analysis have been validated and
reported to the requester.

_Doctors_

In most cases SYNLAB acts as a principal whereas the doctor (as an agent) is arranging the sale with the patient
(while using the results for his diagnosis). Each patient (customer) enters into a contract with SYNLAB as soon as the
doctor transmits the laboratory analysis form (order) with the required services and the patient information on behalf
of the patient. As a result, each order is considered to be a contract with the customer. Accordingly, SYNLAB is
generally invoicing the beneficiary (i.e. the patient) for laboratory services. For contracts where the doctor does not act
as an agent and is invoiced by SYNLAB he or she is considered to be the customer.

The basis for remuneration per analysis and patient is generally based on regulated tariffs, i.e. medical fee schedule.

The (estimated) transaction price per analysis is recognised once the results of the analysis have been validated and
reported to the requester.

Any payments made to the doctor with respect to the collaboration agreement (e.g. signing fees or allowances per
analysis) reduce the transaction price. Depending on their nature they either reduce revenue by order or over the
contract duration.

_Private patients_

Private patients are invoiced directly and even if an insurance company might refund the private patient for the costs
incurred, the claim to consideration is against the private patient.

The transaction price for an analysis is based on medical fee schedules and thus, fixed upfront without later
adjustments. As each contract (order) has only one performance obligation, there is no need to allocate the transaction
price (per analysis).

The transaction price per analysis is recognised once the results of the analysis have been validated and reported to
the requester.

_Hospitals_

In case of contracts with hospitals, SYNLAB often provides more than one service to the customer and/or delivers
more than one good. Therefore, in these cases, two or more contracts entered into at or near the same time with the
same hospital (or related parties of the hospital) have to be combined and accounted for the contracts as a single
contract if (i) the contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective; (ii) the amount of
consideration to be paid in one contract depends on the price or performance of the other contract; or (iii) the goods
or services promised in the contracts are considered to be a single performance obligation.

The activities performed to generate revenues might include e.g. logistics, analytics and the provision of a result. With
respect to lab operations, there are three major types of service arrangements:

Type 1: SYNLAB operates an external lab (outside the hospital’s premises). Accordingly, the arrangement typically
includes logistic services (transportation of samples from the hospital to the external lab).


-----

SYNLAB AG

Type 2: SYNLAB operates a lab onsite the hospital’s premises to meet quality standards (e.g. response times) or for
economic reasons (e.g. to reduce transportation cost), but is not legally bound to do so. SYNLAB has not promised to
operate a lab onsite the hospital’s premises and the hospital has no enforceable right to demand in-house lab
operations.

Type 3: SYNLAB operates a lab onsite the hospital’s premises because it has promised to do so and the hospital has
an enforceable right to demand in-house lab operations.

For type 1 and type 2 arrangements, the service promised to the customer is an analysis, i.e. the combined output of
the several activities, which are either not capable of being distinct or not distinct within the context of the contract (due
to high interrelation). As a result, each contract (order) has only one performance obligation.

For type 3 arrangements, the nature of the promise to the customer is to a complete outsourcing of in-house lab
operations for a specified period of time. This bundled service also includes incidental services that are highly
interrelated to the outsourcing of in-house lab operations. Thus, there is only one performance obligation, which is the
operation of the hospital’s in-house lab (including all analysis performed).

In type 1 and 2 arrangements the transaction price for an analysis is typically based on medical fee schedules. In
addition, there might be volume based discounts, allocated budgets / caps, quotation rates or other clauses that might
cause variability even if the price per analysis due to the medical fee schedule is fixed. In this cases, the amount of
consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for providing each analysis shall be estimated.

Type 3 arrangements typically include an annual fixed amount of consideration that might be constant or increasing or
decreasing from period to period. In addition, there is typically a variable component based on the number and
complexity of analysis actually performed within each period. Accordingly, the amount of consideration to which the
entity will be entitled in exchange for transferring the lab operation services to the hospital shall be estimated.

In each type of arrangement discussed above, there is only one performance obligation. In case of type 1 and type 2
arrangements, the obligation is to perform an analysis. There is no need to allocate the (estimated) transaction price
(per analysis). In case of type 3 arrangements, the obligation is to operate the hospital’s in-house lab for a specified
period of time. The transaction price shall be estimated for the total service period.

With respect to type 1 and type 2 arrangements, the (estimated) transaction price (per analysis) is recognised once
the results of the analysis have been validated and reported to the requester.

In type 3 arrangements, SYNLAB performs recurring services in relation to the in-house lab operations, which are
received and simultaneously consumed by the hospital. Thus, the performance obligation is satisfied over time (total
service period) and revenue shall be recognised by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that
performance obligation.

_Other labs, public agencies and other companies_

The contracting party ordering an analysis is the customer according to IFRS 15. In general, the contractual basis for
the revenue from other labs, public agencies and other companies comes from general service agreements.

The activities performed to generate revenues might include e.g. logistics, analytics and the provision of a result.
However, the service promised to the customer is an analysis (even for multiple parameters), i.e. the combined output
of the several activities, which are either not capable of being distinct or not distinct within the context of the contract


-----

SYNLAB AG

(due to high interrelation). As a result, each contract (purchase order) has only one performance obligation. As each
contract (purchase order) has only one performance obligation, there is no need to allocate the (estimated) transaction
price (per analysis).

The basis for remuneration with respect to revenues from other labs, public agencies and other companies are the
prices stated in the contract. In general, the price for each kind of analysis is fixed.

With respect to revenues from other labs, public agencies and other companies, the (estimated) transaction price (per
analysis) is recognised once the results of the analysis have been validated and reported to the customer.

_Revenues veterinary medicine_

In general, the revenue from veterinary medicine is based on an offer and an acceptance with reference to price list.
Typically, there is a standard price list with fixed prices for each kind of analysis.

The activities performed to generate revenues might include e.g. logistics, analytics and the provision of a result.
However, the service promised to the customer is an analysis (even for multiple parameters), i.e. the combined output
of the several activities, which are either not capable of being distinct or not distinct within the context of the contract
(due to high interrelation). As a result, each acceptance (order) has only one performance obligation.

As each acceptance (order) has only one performance obligation, there is no need to allocate the (estimated)
transaction price (per analysis). With respect to revenues from veterinary medicine, the transaction price (per analysis)
is recognised once the results of the analysis have been validated and reported to the customer.

_Revenues from trading goods_

The contracting party ordering the trading goods is the customer according to IFRS 15. The contractual basis for the
revenue from trading goods can be a standalone contract or part of another contract (e.g. with hospitals or doctors).

Typically, trading goods are both capable of being distinct and distinct within the context of the contract. Accordingly,
each trading good is considered to be a separate performance obligation.

The basis for remuneration with respect to revenues from trading goods are the prices stated in the contract. In general,
the price for each trading good is fixed and – in case the contractual basis is part of another contract – not interrelated
to other goods or services in that contract. Accordingly, there is no variability in consideration.

In general, the prices for trading goods as stated in the contract reflect the stand alone selling price for such trading
good, i.e. the price at which SYNLAB would sell the trading good separately to another customer with similar
characteristics.

With respect to trading goods (that are considered to be a separate performance obligation), the transaction price for
the trading good is recognised on delivery of the trading good to the customer.

**LEASES**

The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of the contract. The Group recognises a
right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease arrangement in which it is the lessee,
except for short- term leases defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets


-----

SYNLAB AG

(defined as all lease of assets with an original price from up to EUR 5,000.00 or local currency equivalent). For short
term and low value leases, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic
benefits from the leased assets are consumed.

Lease liabilities
When initially recognized, the lease liability is valued at the present value of the lease payments not yet made on the
provision date and discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise

- fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives;

- variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the
commencement date;

- the amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

- the exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and

- payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the
lease.

Variable rents that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement the lease liability and the
right of use asset. The related payments are recognised as an expense in the period in which the event or condition
that triggers those payments occurs.

The lease liability is presented as a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position. The lease liability
is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective
interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made.

The Group remeasures the lease liability and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset
whenever

- the lease term has changed or there is a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which
case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.

- the lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a
guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is measured by discounting the revised lease payments
using the initial discount rate (unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating interest rate, in
which case a revised discount rate is used).

- A lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case
the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.

Lease payments

Lease payments included in the measurement of the liability comprise:

- Fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;

- Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the
commencement date;

- The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option;

- Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the
lease; and

- The amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

- Lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease; and residual value guarantees.


-----

SYNLAB AG

The lease liability is subsequently measured after the commencement date by

- increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest method);

- reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made.

Lease modifications

Modifications of leases are assessed whether the modification should be accounted for as a separate lease agreement
or, effectively, a continuation of the existing lease.

Lease modifications are accounted as separate leases when both of the following conditions are met:

- The modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets; and

- The consideration for the lease increases by an amount commensurate with the stand-alone price for the increase
in scope and any appropriate adjustments to that stand-alone price to reflect the circumstances of the particular
contract.

When lease modifications are not accounted for as a separate lease at the effective date of the lease modification, the
Group:

- Allocates the consideration in the modified contract by applying the requirements of IFRS 16.13 to 16;

- Determines the lease term of the modified lease by applying the requirements of IFRS 16.18 and 19; and

- Re-measures the lease liability by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate.

The Group accounts for the re-measurement of the lease liability as follows:

- For lease modifications that decrease the scope of the lease, by decreasing the carrying amount of the right of
use asset to reflect the partial or full termination of the lease. Any gain or loss relating to the partial or full termination
of the lease are recognised in profit or loss; and

- For all other lease modifications, making a corresponding adjustment to the right of use asset and lease liability.

Right of use assets

The right of use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payment made at
or before the commencement day and less any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs. They are
subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Whenever the Group incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which
it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, a provision
is recognised and measured under IAS 37. To the extent that the costs related to a right of use asset, the costs are
included in the related right of use asset, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories.

Right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. If a
lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right of use asset reflects that the Group expects
to exercise a purchase option, the related right of use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset.
The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease.

The right of use assets are presented as a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position.


-----

SYNLAB AG

The Group applies IAS 36 to determine whether a right of use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified
impairment loss as described in the ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ policy.

Short-term lease

The Group makes use of the “short-term” lease exemption for all leases that at commencement date have a lease
term of 12 months or less, including any extension options. Rentals for short team leases are recognised as an
operating expense in profit or loss.

**FOREIGN CURRENCIES**

The individual financial statements of each group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic
environment in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the
results and financial position of each group company are expressed in Euros, which is the functional currency of the
Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.

Foreign currency transactions and balances

In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s
functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the
transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies
are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.

Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates
prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical
cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in
which they arise.

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the group’s foreign
operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.

Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates
fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity
(attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate).

Differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity are
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.

On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal
involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, or a partial disposal of an interest in a joint
arrangement or an associate that includes a foreign operation of which the retained interest becomes a financial asset),
all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the
Company are reclassified to profit or loss.

###### FINANCE INCOME AND FINANCE COSTS

Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested, dividend income, gains on hedging instruments that are
recognised at fair value in profit or loss and foreign currency gains. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in profit
or loss, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date that the Group’s
right to receive payment is established.


-----

SYNLAB AG

Finance costs comprise the cost of net debt and other financial expenses. Cost of net debt includes interest expense
on borrowings and financial leases, as well as expenses related to derivatives. Other financial expenses mainly include
unwinding of the discount on provisions. Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition,
construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
The Group does not own any qualifying assets.

###### RETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS 

Depending on the laws and practices in force in the countries where the Group operates, Group companies have legal
obligations in terms of pensions, early retirement payments and retirement bonuses. Such obligations are generally
state defined contribution plans, but the Group is also affected by post-employment or post-retirement employees’
benefits.

Defined contribution plans

Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognised as an expense when employees have
rendered service entitling them to the contributions. Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit plans are
accounted for as payments to defined contribution plans where the Group’s obligations under the plans are equivalent
to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan.

Defined benefit plans and similar obligations

For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit
Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. Remeasurements
comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets
(excluding interest) are recognised immediately in the statement of financial position with a charge or credit to other
comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements recognized in other comprehensive income
are not reclassified. Past service cost is recognised in profit or loss when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs,
or when the Group recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits, if earlier. Gains or losses on
settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised when the settlement occurs. Net interest is calculated by applying
a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are split into three categories:

- service costs, which includes current service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on curtailments and
settlements;

- net interest expense or income; and

- remeasurements.

The Group recognises service costs within profit or loss as payroll related expenses (see note 8). Net interest expense
or income is recognised within finance costs (see note 13). The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the
consolidated statement of financial position represents the deficit or surplus in the Group’s defined benefit plans. Any
surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of
refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans. Details of the assumptions used are included
in note 27 to the financial statements.

A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of the
termination benefit and when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs. Discretionary contributions made
by employees or third parties reduce service cost upon payment of these contributions to the plan. When the formal
terms of the plans specify that there will be contributions from employees or third parties, the accounting depends on
whether the contributions are linked to service, as follows:


-----

SYNLAB AG

- If the contributions are not linked to services they are reflected in the remeasurement of the net defined benefit
liability (asset).

- If contributions are linked to services, they reduce service costs.

###### TAXATION

Current income taxes

The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it
further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

The Group adopted IFRIC 23. IFRIC 23 sets out how to determine the accounting tax position when there is uncertainty
over income tax treatments. The Interpretation requires the Group to:

- Determine whether uncertain tax positions are assessed separately or as a group; and

- Assess whether it is probable that a tax authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment used, or proposed to be
used, by an entity in its income tax filings:

`o` If yes, the Group should determine its accounting tax position consistently with the tax treatment used or
planned to be used in its income tax filings.

`o` If no, the Group should reflect the effect of uncertainty in determining its accounting tax position using
either the most likely amount or the expected value method.

Deferred tax

According to IAS 12 the balance sheet liability method is used for deferred tax accounting. Deferred taxes are
recognized for temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the
consolidated statement of financial position, and for tax losses and interest carryforwards Deferred tax liabilities are
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it
is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects
neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group can control the reversal of the temporary difference
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising
from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent
that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary
differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.


-----

SYNLAB AG

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled, or the
asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited
in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income.

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the way
the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and
liabilities.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax
assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and
the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

In accordance with IAS 12, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Current tax and deferred tax for the year

Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial
accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination.

Value-added tax (VAT)

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated VAT, unless the VAT incurred is not
recoverable from the taxation authority. The main SYNLAB Group activities being related to medical services are
exempt from VAT in most of the countries in which the Group operates. In this case the Group cannot recover VAT
applicable to charges and expenses relating to those VAT exempt activities and it is recognised as part of the cost of
the acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense. In the case of Group companies for which partial reimbursement
of VAT is possible, the non-reimbursable portion of VAT is not deducted.

The VAT amount to be refunded by or paid to the tax authority is recognised in the statement of financial position under
“Other current assets” or under “Other liabilities”.

###### PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and subsequent expenditure is
capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.

Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.

If material parts of property, plant and equipment must be replaced at regular intervals or have different useful lives,
the Group capitalises such parts as separate assets (major components) with specific useful lives or depreciation
periods.

Other maintenance and repair costs are recorded in profit or loss. The net present value of expected costs for disposal
of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the criteria for recognition have been fulfilled.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when the asset is permanently withdrawn
from use and no future economic benefits are expected. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant
and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant
and equipment, and are recognised net within other operating income in profit or loss.


-----

SYNLAB AG

###### DEPRECIATION

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives, using
the straight-line method.

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period,
with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:

- Land and buildings 15 to 30 years;

- Technical machines and equipment 3 to 10 years;

- Vehicle fleet 3 to 5 years; and

- Other fixed assets 2 to 10 years.

###### INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets are recognised for the first time at acquisition cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a
business combination is calculated as the fair value at date of acquisition.

Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets with finite useful lives acquired separately or in a business
combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

- Customer relationships 3 to 25 years;

- Trademarks 1 to 10 years;

- Trademark (own brand) indefinite;

- Property rights and similar rights 3 to 6 years; and

- Software 1 to 7 years.

Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. An internallygenerated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) is
recognised if, and only if certain conditions have been demonstrated. Expenditure on software development is
capitalised when it is probable that the project will, after considering its commercial and technical feasibility, be
completed and generate future economic benefits and the costs can be measured reliably.

During the initial purchase price allocation when setting up the SYNLAB Group, the SYNLAB brand was identified as
an intangible asset by the acquirer SYNLAB Limited, which was an independent 3[rd] party in this process, at that time.
As the SYNLAB brand exists since the creation of the company in 1998 and SYNLAB is the largest European laboratory
operator with a global presence, an indefinite useful life has been retained.

The amount initially recognised for internally-generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from
the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internally-generated
intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it is


-----

SYNLAB AG

incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, internally-generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately.

Intangible assets are derecognised either upon disposal or when no economic benefits are expected to flow from
further use or from the disposal of the recognised asset. Profit or loss arising from the derecognition of the asset are
recorded in the income statement as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the
asset in the period in which the asset is derecognised.

###### IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL

At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss. An intangible asset with
an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset
may be impaired.

The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of the fair value of an asset or a cash generating (“CGU”) unit less
cost of sale and the value-in-use. The recoverable amount must be determined for each individual asset unless a
particular asset does not generate any cash flows that are largely independent of other assets or other groups of
assets, in which case, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs. If the
carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its respective recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and is reduced
to recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is
carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.

Value-in-use is the net present value of future expected cash flows using a discount rate before tax that reflects market
expectations with respect to the interest rate effect and the specific risk of the asset. Recent market transactions, if
applicable, are taken into consideration when determining the fair value less any cost of sale. If there are no such
identifiable transactions, a suitable valuation model is used. This is based on valuation multiples or other available
indicators of fair value.

Assets other than goodwill are assessed at every reporting date as to whether there are indications that a previously
recorded impairment loss no longer exists or has been reduced. If such indications are present, the Group assesses
the recoverable value of the asset or the CGU. Any previously recorded impairment losses are only reversed if a
change in the assumptions that formed the basis for the determination of the recoverable amount has taken place
since recording the last impairment loss. The impairment reversal is limited by the fact that the carrying amount of an
asset may neither exceed its recoverable amount nor the carrying value that would have remained after scheduled
depreciation if in previous years no impairment losses for the asset had been recorded.

###### INVENTORIES

Inventories consist of raw materials (“reagents”) and consumables and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable
value. Cost comprises direct materials and where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted
average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and
selling expenses.

###### FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.


-----

SYNLAB AG

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly
attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or
financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of
financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and
only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

###### FINANCIAL ASSETS

Ordinary purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular way
purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame
established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.

All recognised financial assets are measured subsequently in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value,
depending on the classification of the financial assets.

Classification of financial assets

Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are measured subsequently at amortised cost:

- The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect
contractual cash flows; and
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

The Group has an immaterial amount of debt financial assets that are recognised as fair value through other
comprehensive income (FVTOCI). By default, all other financial assets are measured subsequently at fair value
through profit or loss (FVTPL).

1) Amortised cost and effective interest method

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating
interest income over the relevant period. For financial assets the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts
estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective
interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) excluding expected credit losses, through the
expected life of the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the gross carrying amount of the debt
instrument on initial recognition.

The amortised cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured at initial recognition
minus the principal repayments, plus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference
between that initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance. The gross carrying amount of a
financial asset is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any loss allowance. Interest income is
recognised using the effective interest method for debt instruments measured subsequently at amortised cost. Interest
income is recognised in profit or loss and is included in the "net finance costs – interest income" line item. For these
financial instruments, the Group measures the loss allowance equal to the 12 month expected credit losses, as there
has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.


-----

SYNLAB AG

2) Financial assets at FVPL

Financial assets, that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortised cost, are subsequently measured at
FVTPL and are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any fair value gains or losses
recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss includes any dividend or interest earned
on the financial asset. Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 32.

A financial asset is held for trading if:

- It has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling it in the near term; or

- On initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and
has evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or

It is a derivative (except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging
instrument).

Financial assets are categorised into current and non-current assets in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Current financial assets comprise:

- Financial assets with a settlement or maturity date within 12 months of the statement of financial position date

Equity instruments

Equity instruments designated as at FVTOCI

On initial recognition, the Group may make an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to designate
investments in equity instruments as at FVTOCI. Designation at FVTOCI is not permitted if the equity investment is
held for trading or if it is contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination.

Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently,
they are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other
comprehensive income. The cumulative gain or loss is not be reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the equity
investments, instead, it is transferred to retained earnings.

Dividends on these investments in equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9, unless
the dividends clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Dividends are included in the ‘finance
income’ line item (Note 12) in profit or loss.

The Group has designated all investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading as at FVTOCI.

Impairment of financial assets

The Group has adopted the simplified expected credit loss model for its trade receivables. To measure the expected
credit losses, trade accounts receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days
past due. Moreover, reasonable and supportable information (if available without undue cost or effort) at the reporting
date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions have been taken into account


-----

SYNLAB AG

in the calculations. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit
risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument.

The Group writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty
and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, e.g. when the debtor has been placed under liquidation or has entered
into bankruptcy proceedings. Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the
Group’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised
in profit or loss.

Definition of default

The Group considers the following as constituting an event of default for internal credit risk management purposes as
historical experience indicates that financial assets that meet either of the following criteria are generally not
recoverable:

  - Information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay
its creditors, including the Group, in full (without taking into account any collateral held by the Group).

The Group writes off a trade receivable only when the trade receivable is uncollectable and there is information
indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, e.g. when the
debtor has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings. Other overdue trade receivables
are not considered written-off, since there is, in fact, no risk of default and only a risk of late payment. In general, there
are longer payment settlement periods for trade receivables, as the business partners are commonly represented by
institutional organizations such as public and private hospitals, public health insurance funds and public health
agencies. Payments are generally secured in terms of contract arrangements.

Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is more than
90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging
default criterion is more appropriate.

Derecognition of financial assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or
when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another
entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to
control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for
amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred
financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for
the proceeds received. On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortised cost, the difference between the
asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognised in profit or loss. On
derecognition of an investment in equity instrument which the Group has elected on initial recognition to measure at
FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the investments revaluation reserve is not reclassified
to profit or loss, but is transferred to retained earnings.

###### FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY

Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance
of the contractual arrangement.


-----

SYNLAB AG

Financial liabilities

All financial liabilities are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method or at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities include borrowings, trade and other payables, derivative financial instruments and other financial
liabilities.

Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the liability is (i) contingent consideration of an acquirer in a
business combination, (ii) held for trading or (iii) it is designated as FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as held for
trading if it has been acquired principally for the purpose of repurchasing it in the near term, or on initial recognition it
is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern
of short-term profit, or it is a derivative, except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee or a designated and effective
hedging instrument. All other financial liabilities are held at amortised cost.

Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL are measured at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on changes in fair
value recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in the profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on
the financial liability.

Financial liabilities that do not meet the criteria to be FVTPL are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs
and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense
recognised on an effective yield basis.

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating
interest expense over the relevant period. On initial recognition, any issue or redemption premiums and discounts and
issuing costs are added to/deducted from the nominal value of the borrowings concerned. These items are taken into
account when calculating the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts
estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter
period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.

Financial liabilities are categorised into current and non-current liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial
position. Current financial liabilities comprise:

- Financial liabilities with a settlement or maturity date within 12 months of the statement of financial position date;
and

- Financial liabilities in respect of which the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for at
least 12 months after the statement of financial position date.

Derecognition of a financial liability

The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled
or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the
consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss.

Derivative financial instruments

The Group may enter into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange
rate risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently
remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.


-----

SYNLAB AG

A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value
is recognised as a financial liability. Derivatives are not offset in the financial statements unless the Group has both
legal right and intention to offset. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the
remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12
months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.

The Group does not apply any hedge accounting.

_Embedded derivatives_

An embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid contract that also includes a non-derivative host – with the effect
that some of the cash flows of the combined instrument vary in a way similar to a stand-alone derivative.

Derivatives embedded in hybrid contracts with a financial asset host within the scope of IFRS 9 are not separated. The
entire hybrid contract is classified and subsequently measured as either amortised cost or fair value as appropriate.
Derivatives embedded in hybrid contracts with hosts that are not financial assets within the scope of IFRS 9 (e.g.
financial liabilities) are treated as separate derivatives when they meet the definition of a derivative, their risks and
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not measured at fair
value.

An embedded derivative is presented as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the
hybrid instrument to which the embedded derivative relates is more than 12 months and is not expected to be realised
or settled within 12 months.

###### CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, bank current accounts, and other bank deposits and short-term
investments considered to be readily convertible into a known amount of cash and where the risk of a change in their
value is deemed to be negligible based on the criteria set out in IAS 7.

Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of Group’s cash management are recorded
under “Short-term borrowings” but included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the
statement of cash flows.

###### PROVISIONS

A provision is recognised if the Group has a present (legal or constructive) obligation arising from a past event,
expenditure of resources with economic benefit to fulfil the obligation is likely, and a reliable assessment of the amount
of the obligation is possible. If an accrued liability is expected to be reimbursed at least in part (e.g. liabilities covered
under an insurance policy), the reimbursement is classified as a separate asset, provided there is a high probability of
it occurring. The expense for such a provision is reported in the consolidated statement of income less any
reimbursement.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation
at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision
is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of
those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material for a cash outflow after more than one year).
Discount rates reflect current assessments of the time value of money and risks that are specific to the liability and not
included in expected cash flows. The unwinding of the discount is recorded as finance costs.


-----

SYNLAB AG

A provision for restructuring is only recognised when the Group has a formalised restructuring plan setting out detailed
requirements regarding the business unit or part of the business unit concerned, the site and the number of employees
concerned, as well as a detailed estimate of associated cost and a reasonable time schedule. The employees
concerned must justifiably expect that the restructuring will take place, or it must have already begun.

###### SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

Share-based payment arrangements in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity
instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions, regardless of how the equity
instruments are obtained by the Group. The expenses also include any social charges to be paid on the shares granted.

For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the goods or services acquired, measured initially
at the fair value of the liability. At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the
fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the year.

Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair
value of the equity instruments at the grant date. Fair value is determined using a suitable option pricing model. The
fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. Details regarding the determination of the fair
value of equity-settled share-based transactions are set out in Note 27, Share-based payments.

The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each
balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of
the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is
recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding
adjustment to equity reserves.

This vesting period ends at the first possibility to exercise the option, that is, when the employee concerned is
irrevocably entitled to exercise the option. The cumulative expenses recorded for equity-settled share-based payment
transactions thereby reflect at any reporting date up to the date of first possibility of exercising the option the vesting
period already expired as well as the number of equity instruments which, based on the best estimate of management,
will eventually vest. However, the amount by which the Group's income is reduced or increased reflects the change in
cumulative expenses reported at the beginning versus the end of the reporting period.

Forfeited equity instruments granted for remuneration are not recorded as expense. An exception is equity instruments
granted for which non-forfeitability is based on certain market or non-vesting conditions. These equity instruments
granted are deemed to be exercisable regardless of whether the market or non-vesting conditions are fulfilled, as long
as all performance and service conditions have been fulfilled.

If the underlying conditions of an equity-settled share-based payment transaction are changed, expenses are recorded
in the minimum amount of costs that would have been incurred if contractual conditions had not been changed,
provided that the original conditions of the remuneration agreement are fulfilled. The Company also records the effect
of changes that increase the fair value of the share-based payment or are related to any other benefit for the employee,
valued at the date of the change.

If an equity-settled share-based payment agreement is cancelled, this is treated as if the option had been exercised
on the day of cancellation. Expenditure not yet recognised is recorded immediately. This applies to all remuneration
agreements for which non-vesting conditions on which either the Company or the employee have an influence have
not been fulfilled. However, if the cancelled remuneration agreement, either equity or cash-settled is replaced by


-----

SYNLAB AG

another remuneration agreement declared on the day it is granted as replacement for the cancelled remuneration
agreement, the cancelled agreement and the new remuneration agreement are recorded as a change to the original
remuneration agreement with an impact limited to the incremental fair value granted, if any, during replacement.

###### NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN PARTNERSHIPS/PUT OPTIONS

Pursuant to the rules prescribed by IAS 32, non-controlling interests in partnerships for which minority partners have
a right of termination are recorded as a liability. In the same manner, shares for which the minority shareholders has
been granted a put option by the majority partner are to be recognised at the fair value of the purchase price as an
obligation. If this is done for a business combination, the business combination is accounted for as if the non-controlling
interests had already been acquired. As a result, goodwill is recognised in full. Such shares are shown on the Group
statement of financial position as a liability under “Other liabilities”. Income from these shares which can be withdrawn
by the minority partner is shown in the consolidated statement of income in “Other financial expenses”.

###### ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT 

In the analysis of the Group’s operating results, we present certain non-IFRS measures as (i) they are used by
management to measure operating performance, in presentations to our board members, and as a basis for strategic
planning and forecasting, and (ii) they represent similar measures that are widely used by certain investors, securities
analysts and other parties as supplemental measures of performance. These measures enhance management's and
investors' understanding of our financial performance by excluding items that are outside of ongoing operations such
as acquisition related costs including integration costs, strategic project costs (e.g. the IPO in 2021), impairment and
reversal of impairment of non-operational assets, income taxes and costs of capital.

We believe that Adjusted Operating Profit is widely used by investors to measure our operating performance and can
vary substantially from company to company depending on the accounting methods, book value of assets and capital
structure or method by which assets were acquired. This adjusted measures eliminates potential differences in
performance caused by variations in capital structures (affecting net finance costs), tax positions (such as the
availability of net operating losses against which to relieve taxable profits), the cost and age of tangible assets (affecting
relative depreciation expense) and the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable (affecting relative amortization
expense). This adjusted measure also eliminates the effect of additional specific items that are considered to hinder
comparison of the trading performance of our business year-on-year.

However, non-IFRS measures are not measures or adjustments determined based on IFRS or any other internationally
accepted accounting principles, and you should not consider such items as an alternative to the historical financial
results or other indicators of our performance based on IFRS measures. The non-IFRS measure, as defined by us,
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as presented by other companies due to differences in the way our
non-IFRS measure is calculated. Even though non-IFRS measures are used by management to assess ongoing
operating performance and these types of measures are commonly used by investors, they have important limitations
as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of SYNLAB's results as
reported under IFRS.

In calculating Adjusted Operating Profit certain items are added back

Adjusted Operating Profit

- Earnings before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation/Amortization/Impairment (EBITDA)

- Share of loss of associates and other non-controlling interest

- Acquisition and integration related costs


-----

SYNLAB AG

- Other non-recurring costs from strategic projects (see Note5)

- Less depreciation and amortization on all items, except for amortization on customer relationships

Adjusted Operating Profit is the group’s segmental performance measure and has therefore been disclosed in Note 5.

###### SEGMENT INFORMATION

In accordance with IFRS 8, the reportable segments are components of the Group that engage in business activities
and whose operating results based on the internal reporting are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decisionmaker.

Segment performance is mainly assessed based on total revenue and adjusted operating profit and is measured
consistently with the statement of income in the consolidated financial statements. All costs initially borne by head
office are allocated to those segments when directly attributable. General costs are assigned to the segments on a
revenue basis, costs with a closer relation to single segments are allocated on a case by case scenario. The Group’s
financing (including finance costs and finance income) and income taxes are centrally managed on a Group basis and
are not allocated to operating segments.

This is the basis on which internal reports are provided to the chief operating decision-maker for assessing
performance and determining the allocation of resources within the Group.

###### DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUES

A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both financial
and non-financial assets and liabilities.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within
the three-level fair value hierarchy.

For assets or liabilities repeatedly reported in the financial statements the Group determines any hierarchy level reclassification by re-evaluating the existing classification at the end of each reporting period. Such revaluation is based
on the lowest-level input parameters which are essential for fair value measurement.

Property, plant and equipment

The fair value of property, plant and equipment recognised as a result of a business combination is based on market
values. The market value of property is the estimated amount that would be received to sell a property in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of items of plant, equipment, fixtures
and fittings is based on the market approach and cost approaches using quoted recent market prices for similar items
when available and current replacement cost when appropriate.

Trade and other receivables

The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the
market rate of interest at the reporting date. The net carrying value is considered as a reasonable estimate of their fair
value considering the short payment and settlement periods applied by the Group. This fair value is determined for
disclosure purposes.


-----

SYNLAB AG

Derivatives

The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on broker quotes. Those quotes are tested for reasonableness on an adhoc basis by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using
market interest rates for a similar instrument at the measurement date. Fair values also reflect the credit risk of the
instrument and include adjustments to take account of the credit risk of the Group entity and counterparty when
appropriate.

Non-derivative financial liabilities

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal
and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.

Share-based payment transactions

The fair value of employee share options is generally measured using a binomial lattice model. Measurement inputs
include share price on measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted
average historic volatility of similar quoted entities), weighted average expected life of the instruments (based on
historical experience and general option holder behavior), expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate (based
on government bonds). Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the transactions are not taken
into account in determining fair value.

statement of income under other operating expenses, in the sub-item "acquisition and disposal-related items".

The fair value of the trade accounts receivables amounts to 4.0 M€. The gross amount of trade accounts receivables
amounts to 4.5 M€. The impairment of trade accounts receivables amounts to 0.5 M€

Goodwill amounting to 103.9 M€ reflects the provisional value of expected benefits from the Group acquisitions
including potential synergies. Goodwill was allocated to the cash-generating group South. The goodwill recognized is
expected to be non-deductible for tax purposes.

All deals have contributed 10.5 M€ to revenue with 0.8 M€ consolidated net profit for the period from continuing
operations since their acquisition.

###### 4.3 Acquisition Gruppo Tronchet, Italy

On 22 July 2021, we acquired Gruppo Tronchet, in Italy. The group included the legal entities listed below.

As a result of this acquisition, the Group expects to reduce costs through economies of scale and therefore the goodwill
represents the fair value of the expected synergies from the acquisitions.

The fair value of the trade accounts receivables amounts to 4.4 M€. The gross amount of trade accounts receivables
amounts to 4.8 M€. The impairment of trade accounts receivables amounts to 0.4 M€

Goodwill amounting to 56.4 M€ reflects the provisional value of expected benefits from the Group acquisitions including
potential synergies. Goodwill was allocated to the cash-generating group South. It is expected that the goodwill
recognized will not be deductible for tax purposes.

All deals have contributed 10.5 M€ to revenue with 0.9 M€ consolidated net profit for the period from continuing
operations since their acquisition.

If the deals had been acquired as at the beginning of the year, revenue would have been 14.7 M€ higher and
consolidated net profit for the period from continuing operations would have 2.3 M€ higher.

SYNLAB AG

The fair value of the trade accounts receivables amounts to 17.6 M€. The gross amount of trade accounts
receivables amounts to 19.0 M€. The impairment of trade accounts receivables amounts to 1.4 M€.

As required by the standard (IFRS 3.36), we have performed a reassessment of whether we have correctly identified
all assets acquired and all liabilities assumed and are required to recognize any additional assets or liabilities
identified in this review. However, we did not identify any missing assets or liabilities. The bargain purchase amounts
to (2.2) M€ and is recognized in acquisition related income.

All deals have contributed 155.8 M€ to revenue with 7.7 M€ consolidated net profit for the period from continuing
operations since their acquisition.

If the deals had been acquired as at the beginning of the year, revenue would have been 42.9 M€ higher and
consolidated net profit for the period from continuing operations would have been 5.4 M€ higher.

4.5 Other Acquisitions

The other acquisitions and corporate structuring activities undertaken during the reporting period are shown below, by
country. The Group has continued its external growth strategy with several laboratory bolt-on acquisitions. A deal
standalone would have been immaterial from the point of view of the group, so we have combined all other acquisitions.

All acquisitions in the period earn revenues mainly from medical or pathology analyses. Through these acquisitions
the Group expects to reduce costs through economies of scale, and the goodwill thus represents the fair value of the
expected synergies resulting from the acquisitions.

#### 5. Segmental analysis

The information by geographical segment presented below corresponds to the information used by Group
management to allocate resources to the various segments and to assess each segment's performance. The Group
uses Adjusted Operating Profit as a key measure of the segments’ results as it reflects the segments’ underlying
performance for the financial period under evaluation.

Adjusted Operating Profit is one of the consistent measures within the Group. The policies applied to determine the
operating segments presented are set out in SYNLAB Limited financials Note 3 “Significant accounting policies” in the
section Segment information. Prior year comparatives do not include results of the segment A&S since this is treated
as discontinued operations.

According to IFRS 8.23 assets and liabilities for each reportable segment shall be reported if such amounts are
regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. Balance sheet amounts are not reported according to segment
since they are currently not used for steering the Group, and the information cannot be made available with reasonable
effort.

The segment results and the reconciliation of the segment measure to the respective statutory items included in the
Group statement of income are as follows:

The detail of revenue by country is outlined in Note 6 Revenue.

The restructuring and other significant expenses line mainly includes expenses for strategic Group projects amounting
to 21.3 M€ (2020: 13.0 M€) and relate to the costs in connection with the IPO of SYNLAB AG. In the 2020 financial
year, the costs mainly related to strategic IT projects and the preparation for the exit of the financial investor. In addition,
restructuring, post-merger integration and other costs of 1.5 M€ (2020: 4.1 M€) are included, which are related to the
post-merger integration of acquisitions. In the 2020 financial year, the costs mainly related to asset write-offs, staff
redundancies in certain regions in which the Group operates and consulting costs in connection with various projects.
The net costs from merger and acquisition activities relate to legal and consultancy costs in the amount of 4.0 M€
(2020: 2.7 M€). In addition, expenses from changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are included in
the amount of 3.1 M€ (2020: 0.8 M€ income). This development was driven by the significant growth in sales and
earnings as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted earn-out agreements and put/call options for minority

SYNLAB AG

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit from continuing operations or the total profit after tax
attributable to ordinary shareholders of SYNLAB AG by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during
the financial year. Diluted earnings per share are calculated assuming that all potentially dilutive securities and sharebased payment plans are converted or exercised. The number of ordinary shares for the computation of earnings per
share in the previous year was determined due to the capital reorganization in terms of the initial public offering at
SYNLAB AG. Consequently, the shares of SYNLAB Limited were converted into 200.000.000 shares of SYNLAB AG.
This amount is respectively used for the previous year’s purposes. The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per
share is based on the following data:

Goodwill values for the acquisitions made during the period ended 31 December 2021 are provisional and subject to
modification in the twelve months period following the acquisition date.

###### IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR CASH-GENERATING UNITS CONTAINING GOODWILL 

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units or groups of cash-generating units
(“CGUs”) defined at the level of main countries or geographical zones, which represent the lowest level within the
Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.

The CGUs and group of CGUs for the year ended 31 December 2021 are Germany, France, South and North & East.

This CGUs and group of CGUs definition is consistent with the current operating segment structure of SYNLAB Group

and directly results from its reorganization in 2020. Consequently, the current CGUs and group of CGUs structure

reflects the change in management approach and approach in monitoring the results of the Group. The CGUs and

group of CGUs in 2020 were Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, Iberia, LatAm, North, CEMEA. Therefore, the current

CGUs and group of CGUs constellation was attained by means of aggregation of Italy, Switzerland, Iberia, LatAm into

the group South and North, CEMEA into the group North & East.

The carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each CGUs and group of CGUs and key assumptions of the impairment
testing model are as follows:

North & East 278,920 2.3% 8.4% 10.2%

**2,212,128**

**Recoverable Amount**

The recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit was based on its value in use which was determined by
discounting the future cash flows generated from the continuing use of the unit. The main assumptions on which the
value in use of a cash generating unit is based are the discount rate and trends in volumes, prices and direct costs
(inflation) over the period.

SYNLAB AG

The calculation of the value in use was based on the following key assumptions:

- The latest available Group’s 5-year business plan shows trends in volumes, prices and direct costs based on past
trends and on the future market outlook which include a certain level of uncertainties, especially in the current
context of economic difficult environment in certain European countries.

- The cash flows projections for the years 2022 to 2026 include also:

`o` Taxes impact by applying the latest enacted rate per country;

`o` Working capital; and

`o` Capital expenditures

- The terminal value is then calculated by discounting the forecast flows of the last year (2026 as the steady state
of the respective CGU) using a sustainable growth rate between 0.7% and 1,1% (2020: 1.5% and 2.3%) depending
on the cash generating unit. This percentage is management’s best estimate of the inflationary growth effects
based on the long-term inflation rates for each CGU.

- In the terminal value, a sustainable growth in earnings must be taken into account in the form of a growth factor,
which is deducted from the discount rate. The company has aligned its long term growth assumption on the
average long term growth assumption for German companies (not only health care companies) after the transfer
from a UK jurisdiction to a German jurisdiction during the financial year 2021. Studies in Germany have shown
that the profit growth of German companies has not reached the level of inflation in the long term. On average,
the profit growth was only 45% to 50% of the inflation rate. This leads to a reduction of the long term growth rates
compared to the previous year with approximately 50%.

- The discount rate is based on the respective CGU’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) including a
leveraged beta, market risk premium, country risk premium and cost of debt.

- Discount rates used are post-tax discount rates applied to post tax cash flows. Applying those rates result in
value in use materially consistent to those computed using pre-tax discount rates applied to pre-tax cash flow.
(as required by IAS 36).

###### RESULT OF ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING

Based on the impairment test model calculation performed, no impairment needs to be recognized.

###### SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

A post-tax discount rate increase of 1% point would not lead to a goodwill impairment in any of the CGUs or group of
CGUs, except for Germany, where it would lead to an impairment of 92 M€ being recognised.

A 5% decrease in the forecasted EBITDA over the forecast’s horizon included in the terminal value would not lead to
a goodwill impairment in any of the CGUs or group of CGUs, except for Germany, where it would lead to a goodwill
impairment of 73M€ being recognised

#### 20. Investments in associates

The Group’s investments in its associates (equity accounted investees) as at 31 December 2021 was 4.6 M€ (2020:
4.6 M€).

The main group investments in associates correspond to non-controlling investment in a French biology laboratory.

In addition, the Group owned interests of 33% in a local Economic Interest Group (called Consorzio in Italy), which
corresponds to entities in which support functions are pooled, working for both the Group’s laboratories and other
external entities. For those entities, the Group has significant influence but no control of the entities.

In 2021 the Group received dividends of 0.3 M€ (2020: 0.3 M€) from its investments in equity accounted investees.

Details of the Group’s associates at the end of the reporting period are as follows:

The only temporary difference which results in a material deferred tax balance relates to intangible assets. Other types
of temporary differences have been grouped into single categories of other deferred tax assets and liabilities.

At the end of the financial year, there were loss and interest carryforwards totaling 507.6 M€, of which interest
carryforwards amounted to 311.5 M€ (2020: 555.4 M€, of which interest carryforwards amounted to 380.3 M€). The
recognition of these assets, and the non-recognition of assets in respect of tax losses, is based on SYNLAB's board's
estimate of the probability of being able to use these losses (prior to the expiration of the losses), including
consideration of current levels of utilisation, forecast operating results and the level of deferred tax liabilities recognized
in the particular territory / tax grouping. Deferred Tax Assets totaling 2.4 M€ (2020: 3.4 M€) have been recognized on
losses. Deferred tax assets have not been recognized in respect of losses of 186.8 M€ (2020: 161.6 M€), which are
available for indefinite carry forward. These losses have arisen mainly in the UK, Spain, Germany and France. Losses
can be utilised in the future if taxable profits continue to be consistent with current year levels. Whilst there is potential
for the losses to be utilised against future taxable profits, no deferred tax asset is recognised on the basis that it is not
probable that the entities will generate taxable profits in accordance with IAS 12.

The Group has also previously incurred interest expense in excess of the maximum available to be offset against
current profits in a number of territories. An amount of 311.5 M€ (2020: 381.0 M€) is available for indefinite carry
forward depending on local regulations, primarily in Germany, Spain, and France. In addition, deferred tax assets
totaling 1.6 M€ (2020: 1.1 M€) have been recognized on excess interest amounts in companies in France which are
forecasting excess interest capacity. Deferred tax assets have not been recognized in respect of excess interest
amounts of 305 M€ (2020: 376.3 M€) either because excess interest capacity is not currently forecasted for future
periods or because the attributes are expected to be lost on a change in control before they can be utilized.

At 31 December 2021, the retained earnings of subsidiaries consolidated by the group include 15.3 M€ of temporary
differences on undistributed earnings that will be subject to tax if remitted to the shareholder company. Deferred tax
liabilities of 4.1 M€ (2020: nil) were recognized in 2021 for planned dividend payments by subsidiaries within the
foreseeable future.

#### 24. Trade accounts receivable

Net trade accounts receivable break down into the following Segments:


**As at 31 December 2021**


**€000** **Gross** **allowance** **Net**

Germany 178,969 (4,246) 174,722

France 91,359 (6,294) 85,065

North & East 169,112 (6,029) 163,083

South 237,416 (27,734) 209,682

**Total** **676,856** **(44,304)** **632,553**

There has been no change in the estimation techniques or significant assumptions made during the current reporting
period.

The Group writes off a trade receivable when there is information indicating that the debtor is in severe financial
difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, e.g. when the debtor has been placed under liquidation or has
entered into bankruptcy proceedings.

As a result of the billing processes and billing cycles in the various countries and businesses, there are 150.7 M€
(2020: 98.4 M€) of accrued income not yet billed to customers included in trade accounts receivables.

The ageing of trade accounts receivable at the reporting date was as follows:

The actual write-off relating to trade receivables as at 31 December 2021 amounts to 3.1 M€ (2020: 3.7 M€). There
was no material individual impairment of trade receivables.

The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk due to a large number of private customers and individually
non-significance of amounts due. The Group performs continuous credit evaluations of its receivables.

Trade receivables are exposed to a lower default risk, when they are less than 12 months past due. The provision
rates vary in this ageing group from 0.1% to 20% in exceptional cases. Trade receivables are considered to be exposed
to a higher default risk, when they are more than 12 months past due. The provision rates vary in this ageing group
from 60% to 90%.

Allowances for credit losses for trade accounts receivable are disclosed in the operating result. Subsequently incurred
credit losses and written-off amounts are recorded in the same income statement line.

#### 25. Cash and cash equivalents

The purpose is to reconcile cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet and in the consolidated statement of cash
flows in order to avoid any difference resulting from bank overdraft. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the
reporting period as shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows can be reconciled to the related items in the
consolidated statement of financial position as follows:

In May 2021 the Group issued two new financial debt instruments, both held by SYNLAB AG: a 500 M€ Revolving
Credit Facility (RCF) and a 735 M€ Term Loan A. Both financial debt instruments bear an initial floating interest rate
at 2.5% p.a. (subject to a margin ratchet) + Euribor (with a 0% floor) and mature in May 2026. The existing 250M€
RCF held by Synlab Bondco was cancelled and the not amortized part of the debt issuance costs of 1.4 M€ was
released in the profit and loss statement.

###### 735 M€ TERM LOAN A

Term Loan A, held by SYNLAB AG, is designated at amortized cost. Fees incurred in the issuance of the Term Loan,
currently amounting to 4.7 M€, have been capitalized as debt issuance costs and amortized over the maturity of the
financial instrument, using the effective interest rate method. The interest is paid semi-annually. Proceeds of this Term
Loan together with the cash on the balance sheet were used to repay the existing 850 M€ Senior Secured Floating
Rate Notes. This financial instrument has an embedded derivative (Euribor floored zero) that meets all criteria
according to IFRS 9 and was therefore separated from the host contract and measured at fair value through profit and
loss. All fair value changes of the embedded derivatives are recognized either in interest income or interest expense
line item.

###### 500 M€ REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY 

As of 31 December 2021, the facility was not drawn and accrued interest for non-utilization fee amounts to 0.4 M€.

###### 385 M€ TERM LOAN B4
Term Loan B4, held by SYNLAB Bondco Plc with a nominal amount of 385 M€ is designated at amortized cost. The
interest is paid semi-annually.

issuance costs amounting to 6.7 M€ were recognised in the profit and loss statement and were included in the "net
finance costs – interest expenses” line item.

###### DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

All Term Loans exhibit embedded derivatives due to the variable interest part being floored at zero (i.e., Euribor floored
zero). These embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and measured at fair value through profit and
loss. All fair value changes of the embedded derivatives are recognized either in interest income or interest expense
line item. The fair value of the embedded derivative liability as at 31. December 2021 is 19.0 M€.

SYNLAB AG

#### 27. Employee benefits liabilities

Most of the Group’s employees are covered by state pension and collective plans managed by third parties if required
under local legislation. Those plans are defined contribution plans.

In addition to these legal pension schemes, a provision for pensions and other post-employment benefits is recorded
in the IFRS consolidated statement of financial position as of 31 December 2021, 31 December 2020 based on an
actuarial expert opinion for the following obligations:

###### OBLIGATIONS IN SWITZERLAND

In general, employers in Switzerland must offer a pension plan to its employees in accordance with the Federal Law
on Occupational Retirement, Survivors’, and Disability Pension Plans (BVG). Employees whose salary exceeds a
particular threshold – which is redefined periodically – participate in the pension plan. The BVG requires a minimum
plan, the "BVG minimum", which must be covered in any case.

The Group’s pension plans in Switzerland are contribution-based plans with guarantee of a minimum interest credit
and fixed conversion rates at retirement. The pension plans also provide benefits in case of disability and death. The
Group as a sponsoring employer is affiliated to various collective foundations and fulfils the legal obligation by means
of a defined benefit plan. Each collective foundation is responsible for the governance of the plan and the board is
composed of an equal number of representatives from the employers and employees chosen from all affiliated
companies.

The pension plan must always be fully funded under BVG law on a static basis. The Group is exposed to the risk that
in case of an underfunding, recovery measures must be taken which encompass additional financing through employer
or reduction of benefits (or both). Such risk may occur in case when the life expectancy of plan participants is higher
than expected. Furthermore, the underlying plan assets may develop differently than expected.

The Group Pension obligations and ongoing service cost were calculated using the projected unit credit method,
applying a discount rate of 0.35% (2020: 0.10%) and a salary increase rate of 1.20% (2020: 1.00%) p.a. Staff turnover
assumptions is based on the demographic BVG 2020, (2020: BVG 2015). The individual values range from between
1.66% and 31.00% (2020: was between 1.23% and 29.59%). Mortality, disability, and withdrawal probabilities were
calculated in accordance with the new demographic tables BVG 2020, CMI 1.25% (2020: BVG 2015).

Long-services award commitments (“jubilee awards”) in Switzerland are based on collective or other agreements
granting employees long-term claims depending on their remuneration levels and duration of service. Provisions for
long-service awards were calculated applying a discount rate of 0.35% (2020: 0.10%), a salary increase rate of 1.20%
(2020: 1.00%), and a staff turnover rate per BVG 2020 of between 1.23% and 29.59% (2020: BVG 2015 of between
1.23% and 29.59).

###### OBLIGATIONS IN FRANCE

In France, the Group provides benefits in case of retirement, which are based on various collective bargaining
agreements. The corresponding plans are mostly fully unfunded. The Group is exposed to the risk that the salary
increase could be higher than expected. In France, the life expectancy is less important in terms of risk exposure given
that the benefit is paid as a lump sum.

Based on collective agreement, a payment is granted to staff when they retire depending on their remuneration levels
and duration of service. Provisions were calculated based on following actuarial assumptions: voluntary departure,
discount rate amounting to 1.10% (2020: 1.00%), inflation rate 2.00% (2020: 1.75%), salary increase between 2.00%


-----

SYNLAB AG

(2020: between 1.0% and 1,5%) p.a., age at retirement phased depending on birth date with a maximum of 65 years
for employees and 67 years for executives; social charge rate 46.49% (2020: 46.49%) and low staff turnover rate.

###### OBLIGATIONS IN ITALY

Pursuant to statutory regulations (Trattamento di Fine Rapporto, TFR), employees are entitled to a one-time severance
payment when they leave the Company. The amounts depend on the employee’s term of service and salary level.
Provisions were calculated based on following actuarial assumptions: discount rate of 1.00% (2020 0,85%), inflation
rate 1.70% (2020: 0.70%) and salary increase 2.00% (2020: 2.00%) p.a.

###### OTHER OBLIGATIONS

In certain other countries, there are legal obligations to make a one-time salary-based severance payment to a retiring
employee (Austria, Ecuador) or when they leave the Company (United Arab Emirates, Mexico). The Group assumed
also pension obligations from defined benefit plans for a few executive staff as a consequence of specific agreements
in Ecuador, Germany, Netherlands, Norway and UK. The plans in the United Kingdom come from the Viapath
acquisition.

The defined benefits plan for Netherlands and Norway and some Austrian, Germans, Italian and Swiss defined benefits
plans are included in our discontinued Note 15.

SYNLAB AG

#### 28. Share-based payment schemes

SYNLAB AG has set up various long-term, share-based payment schemes for the SYNLAB Group in the financial
year. These include the following programmes:

- LTIP (long term incentive plan) for the Management Board / grant date: 1 May 2021

- LTIP for senior executives / grant date: 1 May 2021

- Virtual LTIP for employees / grant date: 1 July 2021

According to the terms and conditions of the various programmes, share-based commitments may in general be settled
in cash or in shares of SYNLAB AG (settlement option). However, the Supervisory Board and the Management Board
have determined in their respective resolutions that the settlement will be made through shares in SYNLAB AG.
Consequently, all three programmes are treated as equity-settled.

Share-based commitments may be forfeited if the beneficiary's employment ends before the end of the vesting period.

The share-based commitments are subject to a vesting period of three to four years and grant an entitlement to
compensation which the beneficiaries will receive after the vesting period without making a payment.

LTIP for the Management Board

The awards are granted in the form of Performance Share Units (PSU) and are linked to performance criteria. For the
share awards granted in the past financial year, 40% of the target amount is linked to the development of SYNLAB's
share price (Total Shareholder Return “TSR”) and 60% of the target amount is linked to SYNLAB's relative share
development compared to the development of the MSCI Europe Health Care Equipment & Services sector index (TSR
target). The range of target achievement of the individual performance criteria is from 0% to 300%. The vesting period
is three years. The fair value of these entitlements was 2.05 M€ and was determined based on a Monte Carlo valuation
model. The weighted average fair value of a PSU was 17,46 €. An expected volatility of 30.0% and a price of 19.75 €
per SYNLAB share were used in this model. The expected volatility was derived from historical volatilities. A risk-free
interest rate of 0.9% to - 0.6% and an expected dividend yield of 2.0% were used in the model. Assumptions on
correlations between the SYNLAB share price and the development of the MSCI Index were determined on the basis
of historical price developments.

LTIP for senior executives

The awards for senior executives are also linked to performance criteria. Both the determination or allocation of the
target amount and the determination of the fair value are identical to the LTIP for the Management Board. However,
the vesting period for this plan extends over four years. The fair value of these entitlements was 1.2 M€. The weighted
average fair value of a PSU was also 17,46 €.

Virtual LTIP for employees

In the past financial year, 271,490 virtual share awards were granted to various employees of the SYNLAB Group.
These are not linked to performance criteria but include a service criterion. The vesting period is four years. The fair
value of these entitlements amounted to 4.9 M€ and was determined on the basis of a valuation model. The weighted


-----

SYNLAB AG

average fair value of a virtual share award was 19 €. A price of 17.95 € per SYNLAB share on the grant date, a riskfree interest rate of - 0.6% and an expected dividend yield of 2.0% were used in this model.

The share awards to the Management Board, senior executives and other eligible employees developed as follows:

**LTIP Management Board** **2021**

Shares outstanding at the beginning of the period 
Granted 117,420

Forfeited 
Shares outstanding at the end of the period 117,420

**Virtual LTIP** **2021**

Shares outstanding at the beginning of the period 
Granted 271,490

Shares outstanding at the end of the period 271,490

The total expense for the year 2021, which was recorded for those three plans amounted to 1.3 M€.

SYNLAB AG

In previous years, and thus in the predecessor group of SYNLAB Limited, the following share-based remuneration
plans existed until the contribution into SYNLAB AG and the IPO of SYNLAB AG:

Free Share Plan

A free share scheme existed between November 2014 and the 2018 financial year. The conditions included a
cumulative performance condition and an active employment period of two years with the obligation to retain the shares
for a certain period. By the 2018 financial year, a total of 139,000 free shares had been awarded under this programme,
the value of which was determined at the date of grant using a binomial model. These shares were exercised with the
IPO, thus settling the plan.

Management Package Plan

In November 2015, SYNLAB Limited introduced a management package by granting A ordinary shares to certain
managers. For certain beneficiaries, A ordinary shares were subscribed by a special entity (Management Co.) funded
by the managers, with the ordinary shares being acquired at fair value with a holding period of one year. Other
beneficiaries were granted A ordinary shares free of charge, subject to a one-year service condition and a one-year
holding period. The awards were conditional on being employed by the company at the time of exercise. The share
awards under this scheme as at 31 December 2020 were as follows. These shares were exercised with the IPO, thus
settling the plan:

**2020**

**A Ordinary Share Plan** **number of share options** **average exercise price**

Shares outstanding at the beginning of the period 1.220,835 1.69 €

Shares forfeited during the period - 
Shares outstanding at the end of the period 1.220,835 1.69 €

Range of exercise prices in EUR 1 € – 15.37 €

G Ordinary Share Plan

In December 2016, SYNLAB Limited granted 501,375 G ordinary shares to eligible employees. The vesting period for
these shares was four years. The fair value of the G shares granted was €1.55 and was determined using a binomial
model at the date of grant. In 2017, a further 370,000 G ordinary shares were granted. The average fair value of the
G shares granted was €3.91, determined at the date of grant using a binomial model. In 2018, SYNLAB Limited granted
a further 178,000 G ordinary shares. The average fair value of the G ordinary shares granted was €6.51, determined
at the date of grant using a binomial model. The awards were conditional on being employed by the company at the
time of exercise. The share awards under this scheme as at 31 December 2020 were as follows. These shares were
exercised with the IPO, thus settling the plan:

I Ordinary Share Plan

In 2018, SYNLAB Limited introduced a new class of shares " I Preference Ordinary Shares " and granted a further
375,000 I Preference Ordinary Shares, to key management personnel in 2019. The average fair value of the I
preference ordinary shares granted was €19.23, determined at the date of grant using a binomial model. I preferred
ordinary shares were granted on the condition that the holder is employed by the company at the time of exercise. The
I preference ordinary shares are entitled to participate in the income once the holders of the preference shares already
issued have received an income equal to the nominal value of the preference shares. The holders of the I Shares are
entitled to receive a certain percentage of the dividends paid to the holders of the Preference Shares already issued
and to participate in the returns to the holders of the Ordinary Shares on a pro rata basis according to the number of
shares issued. In 2020, SYNLAB Limited granted a further 19,222 I preference ordinary shares to management. The
average fair value of the I preference ordinary shares granted was €39.58, which was determined using a binomial
model at the date of grant. The share awards under this scheme as at 31 December 2020 were as follows. These
shares were exercised with the IPO, thus settling the plan:

###### OTHER PROVISIONS 

The other provisions mainly relate to provisions for litigation. In the normal conduct of its business, the Group is involved
in legal proceedings relating to different matters (personnel 0.2 M€, damages 0.8 M€ and other claims 0.4 M€) with
uncertainties about the amount or timing of the outflows. According to management and as confirmed by legal counsel,
the recorded provision is considered to be sufficient to cover probable losses.

#### 30. Litigations and Contingent liabilities

Group companies are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. To a large
extent, these concern professional liability and HR related matters, as well as inquiries from public authorities and
health insurance carriers regarding, among other things, billing modalities. Other than that, legal disputes of Group
companies in particular involve tax, social security, customs, data protection and merger control authorities and related
topics. For associated financial risks, provisions are being set by the Group’s entities based on individual case-by-case
assessments.

Additionally, the Group operates in a regulated industry. As such, in the ordinary course of business, the Group is
subject to national and local regulatory scrutiny, supervision and controls. There are no contingent liabilities recognised
as at the year ended 31 December 2021.

###### LIQUIDITY RISK

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial
liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is
to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both
normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
This planning considers the maturity of both its financial assets, and its projected cash flow from operations.

Typically, the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period
of 60 days, including the servicing of financial obligations. In addition, the Group maintains a line of credit (Revolving
Credit Facility) under which drawings could be made for financing acquisitions or for general financing purposes. Refer
to Note 26 Borrowings and other financial liabilities for detail of maturities of financial indebtedness, as well as for a
description of the covenants in place with the RCF agreement. Under these covenants, if the Group does not respect
contractual requirements, it may result in preventing of future drawing on the undrawn facility.

The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a systematic liquidity planning scheme. This scheme considers
the maturity of its financial investments and assets and the projected cash flows from operations.

Prospective liquidity analysis for non-derivative financial liabilities is as follows:

###### MARKET RISK – INTEREST RATE RISK 

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, will affect the Group’s income or the value
of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk
exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.

The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Term Loan tranches and
to the debt drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility (RCF).

At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments were:

**As at 31 December**

**€000** **2021** **2020**


**Fixed rate instruments**

Financial liabilities 617,060 1,856,122


**Variable rate instruments**

Financial assets 443,747 904,900

Financial liabilities 1,409,760 1,283,435

Under the Group’s current financing strategy, the Term Loans held by SYNLAB Bondco Plc bear floating interest at
2,5% for a tranche of 320 M€ (TLB5) and 2,5% for a tranche of 385 M€ (TLB4). The Term Loan held by SYNLAB AG
(TLA) bear floating interest at 1,25% for a nominal of 735 M€. The Group does not enter into financial instruments for
trading or speculative purposes.

Due to the Group’s specific interest rate risk position based on floating rate funding structure, risk management policies
require to monitor interest rate volatility.

Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments

On an annual basis, a 6M EURIBOR reference at 1% would have led to an overall additional payment of 14.4 M€ on
the Term Loans. If the RCF would be drawn for its maximum amount of 475 M€, exposure to interest risk rate on
financial liabilities would amount to a maximum of 4.75 M€ for an increase of variable interest rate of 100 basis points
(over a EURIBOR zero reference). That limited exposure to interest rate risk on financial liabilities would be
compensated by the positive effect on financial income generated by cash equivalents, which are mostly based on
variable rate instruments. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.

At the beginning of 2022, the Group entered into a new interest rate hedging contract. Following this subsequent event,
the interest rate risk for the Term Loans is decreasing and reducing the additional interest payment to 9.9 M€ in the
case of a 6M EURIBOR reference at 1%.

###### MARKET RISK – FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK 

The Group has been exposed to limited foreign exchange risk, given the SYNLAB Group is mostly present in European
countries which are part of the Eurozone, except for the UK operations which are exposed to foreign exchange risk in
respect of the British pound, the Swiss operations which are exposed to Swiss francs, certain Northern or Eastern
Europe countries and Rest of World cash generating unit. Furthermore, the Group has subsidiaries in Latin America
especially in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk in respect of the Brazilian

real, the Colombian peso and Mexican peso. Non-euro denominated total revenue represented, in aggregate,
approximately 23% of the Group’s total revenue for the year ended 31 December 2021.

The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their
translation at the year-end for a 5 per cent change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external
loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other
than the currency of the lender or the borrower. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit and where
currency units strengthens 5 per cent against the relevant currency. The following table demonstrates the sensitivity
to a change in FX-exchange rates of CHF, MXN and GBP with all other variables held constant. The Group’s exposure
to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.

###### CREDIT RISK

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet
its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and investment
securities. Detailed quantitative information on credit risk are provided in Note 24 Trade accounts receivable.

###### TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The Group
has no significant concentrations of credit risks due to the large numbers of customers and individually immateriality
of amounts due. The Group has adopted the simplified expected credit loss model for its trade receivables. The Group
always measures the loss allowance for trade receivables at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. To measure the
expected credit losses, trade accounts receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and
the days past due. The computation of expected credit losses is performed by means of a default risk matrix, which is
based on the historical default rates grouped by trade receivables class and aging buckets. Moreover, reasonable and
supportable information (if available without undue cost or effort) at the reporting date about past events, current

conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions have been taken into account in the calculations. The amount
of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of
the respective financial instrument.

###### INVESTMENTS AND CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

The Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty. The Group limits its exposure to credit risk
by investing mainly in liquid securities with counterparties that have a high credit rating. Management actively monitors
its investments and does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit
risk at the reporting date was:

**As at 31 December**

Trade accounts receivables 632,395 534,810

###### FAIR VALUES 

The basis for determining fair values is disclosed in Note 3 Determination of fair values.

Fair value of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis

Some of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting
period. They consist mainly of shares and other securities <20%, call options on non-controlling interests with agreed
price determination formula as well as contingent consideration recorded in a business combination (as detailed in
Note 31 Trade payables and other liabilities) which are all categorised within level 3 and for which fair values have
been usually determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on a discounted cash flow
analysis, with the most significant input being the discount rate that reflects the credit risk of counterparties. Embedded
derivatives that were separated from the host contract are categorized within level 2. The Bachelier model is used for
the valuation of the embedded derivatives, the main parameters are the nominal amount, the floor, the length of a
single floorlet, the risk free interest rate, the EURIBOR forward rates as well as the volatility of the EURIBOR forward
rates.

Reconciliation of Level 2 fair value measurements

The total fair value gains or losses on embedded derivatives are disclosed in Note 12 Net finance costs.

Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements

The total fair value gains or losses on contingent considerations recognised in the statement of income are included
in the table below. The fair value of contingent considerations is mainly dependent on the results of the acquired
entities in a certain period after the acquisition and will be adjusted based on actuals and amended projections. Higher
result will usually lead to higher contingent considerations, lower results will lead to lower contingent considerations.
In many cases however a certain bandwidth of possible outcomes is defined in the contracts, which limit the movement

Change in fair value 3,126 (1,112)

**As at 31 December 2020** **9,964** **15,762**

The Group measures derivative financial instruments, a non-controlling interest in a partnership (puts on NCI) and
contingent consideration recorded in business combinations at fair value through profit and loss.

The fair value of non-controlling interests in a partnership was measured based on the compensation formula set forth
in the partnership agreement and in consideration of the Company’s planning and market interest rates. The fair value
thus measured is therefore classifiable to hierarchical level 3. The discounted cash flow method was used to capture
the present value of the expected future economic benefits that will flow out of the Group arising from the contingent
consideration. The fair value arising from liabilities related to business combinations is derived from valuation
techniques which includes inputs that are not based on observable market data (Level 3).

The notional amount of Financial Instruments designated at Fair Value through Profit and Loss outstanding at the end
of reporting period was 50.5 M€ (2020: 25.7 M€).

#### 34. Capital commitment and contingencies

###### OFF BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS GIVEN AND RECEIVED 

As of 31 December 2021, and 31 December 2020, the Group’s off-balance sheet commitments consist principally of
guarantees given in the course of its investing and financing activities, in particular securities provided to secure the
Senior Secured Notes, RCF and Term Loans.

Indeed, the obligations taken by SYNLAB Bondco PLC under the Senior Secured Notes indentures and by the
borrowing entities according to the RCF agreement and the Senior Secured Team Loan agreements, have been
guaranteed by a certain number of Group entities, called Guarantors.

The RCF and the Senior Secured Term Loans provide that the commitments from borrowers pursuant to the RCF and
Senior Facility Agreements are jointly guaranteed on the same basis as the Group’s Bonds: (i) by SYNLAB Bondco
PLC; and (ii) by some subsidiaries (together “Guarantors”) representing more than 50% of the Group Adjusted EBITDA.
The Collateral securing the obligations under the RCF and the Term Loans are the same as the ones securing the
obligations under the indentures relating to the High Yield Bonds. They are mainly composed of: (i) pledge over the
shares of certain Group companies; and (ii) the pledge over the long-term intercompany loans’ receivables under any
intra group loan in excess of 5.0 M€. Refer to Note 26 Borrowings and other financial liabilities for the details of the
covenants under the RCF and the Term Loans.

All securities contained in the above paragraph and related to financing activities have fallen in 2021 with regards to
the post-IPO RCF agreement and the repaid Term Loans and High Yield Bonds.

The new shares shall have a profit entitlement as from 1 January 2021. The registration of the non-cash capital
increase in the Commercial Register was effective on 28 April 2021. During this transaction the shares of SYNLAB
Limited, London, United Kingdom, were contributed to SYNLAB AG. SYNLAB Limited is a private company limited by
shares incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act and is registered under the number 09630775
(England and Wales).

During the extraordinary general meeting on 27 April 2021, it was also resolved to increase the Company’s share

On 27 April 2021, the general meeting furthermore authorised the executive board, with the approval of the supervisory
board, to increase the Company’s share capital one or several times until 26 April 2026 up to a maximum amount
equal to 50 percent of the Company’s share capital existing after the registration of the contributed capital increase
and the IPO capital increase (i.e. up to EUR 111,111,111.00) by issuing the related number of shares against cash
and/or non-cash capital contribution (“authorised capital 2021”). The registration of the authorised capital in the
Commercial Register was also effective on 28 April 2021.

###### CAPITAL RESERVE
In connection with the capital increases mentioned above, the premium was allocated to capital reserve. At the issuance price of
the shares, this resulted in an increase of capital reserve by EUR 3,776,927,774. Thereof €7.1 million financing related costs
had to be deducted according to IFRS.

###### RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

In connection with the aforementioned capital increase against contributions in kind, the shareholders of SYNLAB
Limited exchanged their shares in SYNLAB Limited for shares in SYNLAB AG at a ratio of 1:1 and thereby made their
contribution. This 1:1 exchange did not affect the shareholders' shareholding ratio.

Furthermore, the costs of the IPO were charged to the shareholders of SYNLAB Limited in the amount of 16.7 M€.

###### CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

The Company's objective is to maintain a strong equity base in order to maintain the confidence of shareholders,

#### 36. Related party disclosures

According to IAS 24, related parties include those companies and persons where one person or company has the
ability to control the other party or exercise significant influence over its financial and operating policies. Significant
influence can be exercised in a number of ways, often through a seat on the management and/or supervisory body,
but also through intra-group transactions of significant size or the exchange of management personnel. Significant
influence can be established through shareholdings, bylaws or contractual agreements. In the case of share ownership,
significant influence is presumed in accordance with the requirements of IAS 28 if the shareholder directly or indirectly
holds 20 per cent or more of the voting rights, unless this presumption can be clearly rebutted. Significant influence is
irrefutably presumed if the policy of the company can be influenced, for example, by a corresponding appointment to
the supervisory bodies.

Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries and between subsidiaries have been eliminated on
consolidation and are not discussed in this note.

With regard to SYNLAB AG and the SYNLAB Group, Cinven is able to exercise significant influence due to its
shareholding (via Cinven Capital Management (V) General Partner Limited and Ephios Luxembourg S.à r.l.,
Luxembourg, the Company's largest shareholder). Cinven as well as other significant shareholders are therefore to be
classified as a related party. In the 2021 financial year, a management service agreement existed until the IPO in April
2021, for which a total of 0.2 M€ was paid to Cinven. In addition, Cinven charged 0.2 M€ for services in connection
with the IPO. In addition, a portion of the costs of the IPO were passed on to the shareholders of SYNLAB AG on a
pro rata basis. SYNLAB AG received 16.7 M€ from this recharge.

SYNLAB AG prepares the consolidated financial statements for the largest and the smallest group of companies to
which the company belongs as parent company. These consolidated financial statements are filed with the electronic
Federal Gazette.

**INTEREST RATE CAP DERIVATIVE**

The SYNLAB Group entered into a new interest rate hedging contract on the nominal amount of 500 M € at the
beginning of 2022. Following this subsequent event, the interest rate risk for the Term Loans is decreasing and
reducing the additional interest payment to 9.9 M€ in the case of a 6M EURIBOR reference at 1%.

**BELARUS AND UKRAINE**

As a result of the belligerent actions between Russia and Ukraine involving Belarus, SYNLAB sites in Ukraine were
closed from the end of February 2022 and until further notice. However, this has a very limited impact on SYNLAB,
as the Group has no sales in Russia and only minor sales in Ukraine (below 2 M€) and Belarus (below 6 M€).
