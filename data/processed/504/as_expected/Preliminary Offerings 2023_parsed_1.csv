Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in the section entitled ""Risk Factors"" in this Offering Memorandum. For example, factors that could cause our actual results to vary from projected future results include, but are not limited to: - regulatory conditions in the markets in which we operate and our ability to comply and respond effectively to regulatory reforms; - decreases in government-controlled tariffs for clinical laboratory services; - efforts by third-party payers and health insurance companies to control healthcare spending and reimbursement levels; - weak economic conditions including economic downturns; - the impact of high inflation on material, personnel and operating expenses; - increased quality and price competition; - our ability to execute acquisitions and effectively integrate acquired businesses into our network; - the achievability of our cost savings objectives; - failure to manage or integrate acquisitions or achieve anticipated synergies; - failure to realize the full value of goodwill recorded; - negative market perceptions, particularly with respect to the safety, effectiveness and quality of our testing; - our dependence on large customer contracts; - our ability to retain or recruit experienced laboratory doctors; - our dependence on senior management, experienced laboratory professionals and key personnel; - our compliance with appropriate quality standards for our testing services; - business interruptions at our laboratory facilities and related reputational damage; - difficulties in collecting on customer debts; - disruption to our collection and transportation networks; - adverse results in material litigation; - the impact of extreme weather conditions on our activity levels; ----- - disruptions or higher costs due to labor disputes; - uninsured liabilities we may incur; - our exposure to cybersecurity risks; - failure to license new test or technology; - failure of our information technology systems; - failure to protect our trademarks in the countries in which we operate; - our compliance with or obligations under privacy, environmental, health and safety laws; - challenges to the organization and legal structure of our French operations and our dependence on laboratory doctors to check operations carried out by SELs (as defined herein); - failure of our internal controls, procedures, compliance systems and risk management systems; - failure to comply with tax legislation, including VAT and French payroll tax; - other risks related to our capital structure and the Notes; and - certain other risks set forth under the heading ""Risk Factors.""

These forward-looking statements may be included in, but are not limited to, press releases (including on our website), reports to our security holders and other communications.

504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,87,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS USED IN THIS OFFERING MEMORANDUM,87.2,Other Financial Measures,87.2.1,Non-IFRS Measures,"Throughout this Offering Memorandum, we present financial measures and adjustments that are not presented in accordance with IFRS, or any other internationally accepted accounting principles. Certain of these measures are termed ""Non-IFRS"" measures because they exclude amounts that are included in, or include amounts that are excluded from, the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, or are calculated using financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with IFRS. These Non-IFRS measures include base revenue, COVID-19 related revenue, Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma RunRate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Cash Conversion, Net Capex, net financial debt, Unlevered Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow and organic growth (collectively, the ""Non-IFRS Measures""). - ""Base revenue"" is our total revenue for a period minus COVID-19-related revenue for that period. - ""COVID-19-related revenue"" represents our revenue attributable to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including earnings from SARS-CoV-2 testing and related services, and also includes the temporary decline in our standard routine and specialty diagnostic testing activity that occurred in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. - ""Adjusted Operating Profit"" represents net profit for the period, less profit for the period from discontinued operations, before net finance costs, income tax expenses, amortization of customer relationships, restructuring and other significant expenses (mainly expenses for strategic projects), acquisition- and disposal-related (income)/expenses, impairment of non-current assets, customer relationship amortization and share-based payments. - ""Adjusted EBITDA"" represents net profit for the period, less profit for the period from discontinued operations, before net finance costs, income tax expenses, restructuring and other significant expenses (mainly expenses for strategic projects), acquisition- and disposal-related (income)/expenses, impairment of non-current assets, share-based payments and depreciation and amortization (amortization of customer relationships and operating depreciation and amortization). - ""Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA"" represents net profit for the period, less profit for the period from discontinued operations, before net finance costs, income tax expenses, restructuring and other significant expenses (mainly expenses for strategic projects), acquisition- and disposal-related (income)/expenses, impairment of non-current assets, share-based payments, depreciation and amortization (amortization of customer relationships and operating depreciation and amortization), covenant adjustments (including extraordinary items, share-based payments, start-up losses, the _pro _forma impact of in-year acquisitions and disposals and M&A synergies), management adjustments_ ----- (including M&A and restructuring-related severance, certain provisions, subsidies, write-offs and adjustments and one-off prior year expenses in each of our segments), pro forma adjustments (including public company costs, the full-year impact of acquisitions completed in the year and the impacts of the sales of our veterinary business and our businesses in Switzerland, Poland and Ukraine), illustrative runrate adjustments (including SALIX run-rate savings, anticipated productivity improvements in 2024 and run-rate margin adjustments for our Synnovis contract) and the removal of excess COVID-19 EBITDA. - ""Adjusted EBITDA Margin"" is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the applicable period. - ""Cash Conversion"" is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less Net Capex, divided by Adjusted EBITDA. - ""Net Capex"" is defined as cash outflow for the purchase of intangibles and property, plant and equipment, net of proceeds from the sale of intangibles and property, plant and equipment. - ""Net financial debt"" is external interest-bearing loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. - ""Unlevered Free Cash Flow"" is cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations, adjusted for purchase of intangibles and property, plant and equipment, net of proceeds from sale of intangibles and property, plant and equipment and lease repayments, less interest expenses on leases. - ""Free Cash Flow"" is cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations, adjusted for purchase of intangibles and property, plant and equipment, net of proceeds from sale of intangibles and property, plant and equipment, and lease repayments, further adjusted for interest paid, less interest received, less interest expenses on leases. - ""Organic growth"" between one accounting period (""period n"") and the prior comparative accounting period (""period n-1"") is determined as follows: - organic growth for acquisitions that took place during period n-1 is calculated by comparing (x) revenue in period n with (y) revenue in period n-1 adjusted for the effects of acquisitions (i.e., by adding back revenue from the acquisitions made during period n-1 prior to the date on which the relevant operations were added to the scope of consolidation). The full-year contribution from the acquisitions made during period n-1 consists of the estimate of revenue recognized by the newly acquired companies prior to the date on which they were added to the perimeter of consolidation; - organic growth for acquisitions that took place during period n is calculated by subtracting revenue generated by the businesses acquired between the date on which they joined the perimeter of consolidation and the end of period n; - organic growth for disposals that took place during period n is calculated by subtracting revenue generated by the businesses disposed of between the start of period n-1 and the date on which they exited the perimeter of consolidation; and - the percentage of organic growth is then calculated as the ratio of (x) revenue in period n restated for the acquisitions completed during period n divided by (y) revenue in period n-1 adjusted for the impact of the acquisitions completed during period n-1. We present these Non-IFRS Measures as they (i) are used by management to measure operating performance, including profitability and liquidity, in presentations to our board members, and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting, and (ii) represent similar measures that are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other parties as supplemental measures of performance. These measures enhance management's and investors' understanding of our financial performance, for example, by excluding items that are outside of ongoing operations such as income taxes, costs of capital and non-cash expenses. - As the impact of the COVID-19-pandemic on our revenue has largely subsided and normalized, we present our total revenue apportioned between base revenue and COVID-19-related revenue to allow investors to better evaluate our core underlying business. ----- - We believe that Adjusted Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are widely used by investors to measure our operating performance. Adjusted Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA can vary substantially from company to company depending on the accounting methods, book value of assets and capital structure or method by which assets were acquired. Adjusted Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA both eliminate potential differences in performance caused by variations in capital structures (affecting net finance costs) and tax positions (such as the availability of net operating losses against which to relieve taxable profits), while Adjusted EBITDA also eliminates potential differences in performance caused by the cost and age of tangible assets (affecting relative depreciation expense) and the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable (affecting relative amortization expense). Adjusted Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA also eliminate the effect of additional specific items that are considered to hinder comparison of the trading performance of our businesses either year-on-year or with other businesses. - Our _Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA is a quality of earnings metric provided as a tool for investors to assess the sustainability of our historical earnings and the achievability of future results as this metric adds back to Adjusted EBITDA certain adjustments that are permitted under our financing agreements for the purposes of covenant calculations; makes adjustments for additional one-off, nonrecurring or out-of-period adjustments; makes adjustments for expected acquisitions and disposals that have not yet been completed and includes an adjustment to remove certain public company costs that will no longer be incurred under private ownership; includes adjustments to illustrate the full-year impact on our cost base of either past, ongoing or future productivity or margin enhancements; and eliminates COVID-19-related EBITDA that is in excess of the expected normalized amount of COVID-19-related EBITDA going forward. - We use Adjusted EBITDA for the purposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA Margin. We present our Adjusted EBITDA Margin as a measure of our profitability from operations. The nearest measure under IFRS is profit margin, which is defined as profit for the period divided by revenue. - We present Cash Conversion as a measure of our liquidity. - We believe that Net Capex is useful to assist investors to understand our spending on IT, equipment and infrastructure and our commercial spending separately from our acquisition capital expenditure, which is primarily related to customer lists and associated goodwill from the acquisitions of laboratories. - Our net financial debt provides an indication of the overall strength of our balance sheet and can be used to assess the impact of our cash position as compared to our indebtedness. - We present Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow because we believe these measures are useful to investors to understand the funds that we have available both before and after we have met our financial obligations. - We present organic growth because it is an important element of our strategy that management measures and investors use to evaluate how testing volumes and pricing impact our revenue from one period to the next separately from the impact of the revenue contributions of businesses that we acquire during the relevant periods. However, these Non-IFRS Measures are not measures or adjustments determined based on IFRS or any other internationally accepted accounting principles, and you should not consider such items as an alternative to the historical financial results or other indicators of our performance based on IFRS measures. The Non-IFRS Measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as presented by other companies due to differences in the way our Non-IFRS Measures are calculated. Even though the Non-IFRS Measures are used by management to assess ongoing operating performance and liquidity and these types of measures are commonly used by investors, they have important limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. For example, some of the limitations for the Non-IFRS Measures include the following: - they exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; - they do not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; ----- - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our debts; and - the further adjustments made in calculating Adjusted Operating Profit are those that management consider are not representative of our underlying operations and therefore are, by definition, subjective in nature.

More than 27,000 employees, including over 2,000 medical experts, contribute every day to our worldwide success as we perform around 600 million laboratory tests per year. Our business is well-positioned to take advantage of the growing market for clinical laboratory and medical diagnostic services in Europe, which benefits from favorable structural trends, including an aging population, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, a growing focus on disease prevention, increasing outsourcing of clinical laboratory testing by hospitals and an additional need for advanced testing. We have been a pioneer in the consolidation trend in the European clinical laboratories market. Our expansion strategy is focused on adapting to local market environments while drawing from the strength of our pan-European support functions. Our market position and the scale of our laboratory network also allow us to benefit from favorable procurement conditions with suppliers, including through group-wide panEuropean framework supply agreements for reagents and equipment. Major parts of the European clinical laboratory and medical diagnostic services market remain fragmented, providing further meaningful opportunities for continued expansion. Our SALIX program consists of efficiency-enhancing and cost-savings initiatives relating to laboratory centralization; group-wide logistics management; and the optimization of staffing of laboratories and blood collection points. The SALIX program addresses all three of our primary cost groups (i.e., materials, personnel and other operating expenses). Having been implemented in 2017, with the first savings achieved in 2018, SALIX has generated approximately €140 million in total savings, including approximately €25 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 and approximately €30 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with further ongoing savings expected over the medium term. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded revenue of €2,691.1 million, with net profit (group share) amounting to €130.0 million. Our _Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA was €455.6 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, amounting to 17.6% of our revenue for the period. For a reconciliation of net profit to Adjusted Operating Profit and Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA, see ""—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data."" ----- We have a pan-European presence and hold a top three or top five market position by revenue within most of the markets where we operate.

504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Competitive Strengths,9.4.1,"We operate in the large, resilient and growing clinical laboratory services market, which has advantages for established market participants and is supported by strong non-cyclical growth trends that have been accelerated by COVID-19-pandemic tailwinds.","Our core markets have grown materially throughout the last decade and have proven resilient to economic cycles. The market is also expected to continue to benefit from favorable demographic factors, such as an aging population, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases as well as an increasing propensity of public healthcare providers to outsource diagnostic services to private sector companies, a shortage of experts and personnel specifically in molecular biology, genetics and pathology, a growing focus on disease prevention, increasing outsourcing of clinical laboratory testing by hospitals, a growing market for D2C services, precision medicine and digital, artificial intelligence (""AI"") and data services, the monetization of healthcare data and an increasing demand for fast servicing in specialized diagnostics. These are expected to be key growth drivers for the future. Medical diagnostics services are an essential part of the medical value chain, with approximately 70% of medical decisions based on laboratory results. The medical diagnostic testing market we address today is large, resilient and is expected to grow from a market value of approximately €28 billion in 2023 to approximately €34 billion by 2028, growing at an approximately 3–4% compound annual growth rate (""CAGR""). The medical diagnostics market in our core European countries (France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) is expected to grow at approximately a 2% CAGR from 2023 to 2028. Our established leadership position and reputation as a high quality provider in the medical diagnostics market affords us certain advantages that put us in prime position to grow with the market, which include: (i) economies of scale: significant benefits derived from experience in longer test series infrastructure (lower fixed cost per test) due to scale benefits in overhead and logistics; (ii) increasing regulation: established players are better equipped to deal with strict quality certification regimes, accreditation and guarantor requirements that create financial hurdles that are burdensome for smaller, or independent operators; (iii) know-how: large players are best positioned to acquire and retain skilled medical staff and specialists; (iv) reputation: the build-up of reputation as a reliable, high-quality service provider is time-consuming for new entrants (e.g., building up a referral network) resulting in a competitive advantage for established players; and (v) the _contractual nature of the B2B market: with excellence built into our services and strong relationships with_ physicians in the B2B market and NHS contracts, such as our Synnovis partnership agreement with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in South East London, we are well entrenched as incumbents with a strong knowledge of the hospital or provider situation. In addition to resilient market fundamentals, COVID-19 provided a strong tailwind to the diagnostic testing market during the pandemic and a testament to the counter-cyclical nature of the industry. While COVID19-related testing levels have now subsided and normalized, the industry is now benefitting from an increased focus on awareness and disease prevention. This is driving innovation on the provider side and is increasing access to diagnostic services across the globe, which is expected to continue to sustain volume growth in the long term. In addition, the temporary revenue increases resulting from SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-19-related services have allowed us to invest in our underlying business and ensure that our core services are well-funded going forward. Finally, the medical diagnostic services markets we serve are highly competitive and remain largely fragmented, providing significant opportunities for larger players like us to continue to consolidate the industry, entering new markets and reinforcing presence in existing markets. We believe that consolidation of the clinical laboratory testing market will allow large international laboratory consolidators like us, which benefit from high testing volumes across geographic markets, to further expand regional laboratory clusters, improve efficiency and decrease overall costs.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Competitive Strengths,9.4.2,"We are a global player in the medical diagnostics space and the market leader in Europe by revenue with comprehensive capabilities across a broad range of routine and specialty testing services and are well- diversified across geographies, channels and payers.","We are the largest clinical laboratory services company by revenue in Europe. Our revenue of €3,250.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 25% greater than that of the ----- second largest player in Europe and, like us, that player is estimated to have generated around one-quarter of its 2022 revenue from COVID-19-related services. We are present in all three of the largest EU markets by nominal GDP (i.e., France, Germany and Italy) and in the United Kingdom. We are one of the leaders in each of these four countries, which we consider our core markets, as well as in other geographies. In addition, we have established a strong presence in high-growth emerging markets across Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. In total, we are present in 33 countries across five continents. We have achieved leading positions in more than 20 countries, representing a significant proportion of the countries in which we operate. We draw numerous tangible scale benefits from our wide geographic footprint, leadership position in local markets and full range of services. These include: the ability to offer more competitive contractual terms to customers; enhanced procurement power; the ability to consolidate and automate procedures; the knowledge and resources to create new capabilities (e.g., in retail or hospital settings); the critical mass to build an integrated IT infrastructure; and the expertise to capitalize on opportunities for large-scale data analytics. Scale is a critical differentiator driving costs down and creating a competitive advantage compared to local and regional players. We bring deep understanding of different market needs across the B2B, B2C and D2C business models, adapting our services to local requirements to enhance patient experiences. This commercial and operational flexibility is a key enabler of our new business generation, customer and payer diversification and new market entry. We are well-diversified across the channels, with B2B contributing approximately 60% of our revenue and the remaining approximately 40% coming from B2C and D2C channels. Our strong reputation, market position and proven expertise and presence across all testing categories, enable us to attract and retain industry-leading medical experts and qualified specialists. As a result, we have cultivated a wide network of medical experts, significantly enhancing our medical capabilities and ability to innovate. Through close collaboration with research departments from universities and the pharmaceutical industry, we continuously enhance our diagnostic offering. Furthermore, we have accumulated vast expertise through our operational scale and global presence, which we leverage across markets. Our business also benefits from a wide payer base, including statutory and private insurance, hospital systems, individual clinics and out-of-pocket spending. Our pan-European presence and expertise across payer groups allows us to draw on our experience and know-how while entering new markets, adapt quickly to local conditions and create value. All of the above factors contribute to our well-balanced portfolio across business models, enabling us to serve across different markets. This also ensures diversification across geographies, channels, nature of contracts and types of tests, offering inherent stability and not materially exposing us to any single customer or market segment.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Competitive Strengths,9.4.3,Our customer-centric strategy is aimed at delivering above-market growth and is based on medical and operational excellence and highly skilled employees.,"Our strategy of customer-centric medical excellence has yielded tangible results, including unlocking additional organic revenue growth by providing a superior patient and clinician experience. We are capable of delivering a highly customized end-to-end customer journey that includes registration, sampling, diagnostics, reporting and consultation. We operate an efficient hub-and-spoke network of laboratories (including approximately 30 ""hub"" European reference laboratories and central laboratories and 420 ""spoke"" medical laboratories). Our ""hub"" laboratories consist of two European reference laboratories (near Stuttgart, Germany and near Barcelona, Spain) and additional central laboratories in all of our major countries, all of which perform specialty testing services on samples provided from other network laboratories. In addition, our ""spoke"" laboratories, which include regional laboratories, satellite laboratories and emergency laboratories, together with our point-ofcare testing capabilities, make up the backbone of our efficient hub-and-spoke model. Our ""centers of excellence"" located across our laboratory network deliver medical expertise for certain medical areas and have specialist diagnostic competencies. Through our laboratory network, we are able to offer a wide range of analytical and diagnostic testing services, conducting over 600 million tests per year, including more than 5,000 routine testing services in the field of clinical testing; genetic and anatomic pathology testing of both histological and cytological samples; and diagnostic imaging. In the year ended December 31, 2022, ----- our routine testing services provided approximately two-thirds of our revenue, while our specialty testing services and our other services (e.g., anatomic pathology, examinations, genetics and imaging) each represented approximately one-sixth of our revenue. We offer a tailored approach to prescribers and focus on retail management capabilities. Our business has a broad retail base with millions of patients and a large prescriber customer base. We develop innovative products and provide value-added solutions to hospitals, dialysis centers, polyclinics, outpatient clinics, laboratories and others via a variety of business models including point-of-care, management and supply, outsourcing, joint ventures and consulting services. We adapt our business models (B2B, B2C or D2C) to suit customer requirements, for example, by providing only certain specialty tests, entire laboratory outsourcing services or special consultancy services as necessary to meet the specific needs of our customers. This adaptability is one of our core strengths and is a testament to our customer-centric strategy. Medical excellence is at the core of our business. We offer a full spectrum of approximately 5,000 different testing services ranging from routine to highly specialized (including genetics, anatomic pathology, radiology and nuclear medicine) and we have established ourselves as the top European player in anatomic pathology and genetics. Our genetic testing capabilities include full exome sequencing, large gene panels and single genetic variants. We also have capabilities covering all anatomic pathology sub-specialties. We benefit from the shared medical knowledge of over 2,000 doctors and specialists and partnerships with leading medical universities, which have fostered innovation and contributed to 368 medical publications by SYNLAB scientists in 2022. In addition, we have built a large and highly integrated platform of laboratories on a global scale with a network of over 450 laboratories across 33 countries. This scale at global level creates unique advantages by allowing us to centralize administrative functions and reduce costs. We also leverage our experience across different countries to use the most optimal strategy for entry into new markets, addressing that market's unique structure and allowing us to drive above-market growth and efficient integration. Our extensive B2B operations, serving hospitals and physicians (e.g., in Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom), account for around 60% of our revenue. We deploy a variety of strategies including systematic campaigning by country to prescribers, developing demand management tools for clinicians and hospitals and delivering high-end medical capabilities, reinforcing our medical leadership reputation. Our global laboratory network and understanding of market segmentation positions us for rapid and professional expansion in attractive new markets and enhanced ability to estimate and realize synergies when acquisitions are made in new geographies. We also provide D2C operations focused on prevention and wellness that are paid out-of-pocket in Italy, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, France and Hungary. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated our unique medical, operational and commercial capabilities. We partnered with national healthcare systems and governments from the outset of the pandemic to develop tests and procedures, leveraging our innovation expertise and securing supply chains early to rapidly roll out testing internationally. This strengthened our position as a trusted medical partner and adviser globally and allowed us to win contracts with businesses, educational institutions and sports associations to safely get employees back to work, students back to school and athletes back on the playing field. Our customer-centric strategy has resulted in above-market growth in our key markets. For example, over the period from 2019 through 2023, our B2B business in Germany and the United Kingdom and our B2C business in France and Italy all grew at CAGRs exceeding the market CAGRs for the same period. Our German and UK B2B businesses generated revenue CAGRs of approximately 5% and 6%, respectively, while the underlying markets grew at approximately 2% and 5%, respectively (in each case, excluding SARS-CoV-2 testing revenue). Similarly, our French and Italian B2C businesses generated revenue CAGRs of approximately 2% and 6%, respectively, ahead of underlying market growths of approximately 1% and 3%, respectively (in each case, excluding SARS-CoV-2 testing revenue), over the period.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Competitive Strengths,9.4.4,"We have a strong financial profile, with profitability accelerating through robust organic growth, operational efficiencies, a disciplined approach to capital allocation and solid cash generation.","We have consistently demonstrated solid growth, increasing our total revenue by a CAGR of 11.3% between 2012 and 2022 (or 8.3% when excluding COVID-19-related revenue). We have largely exceeded long-term revenue growth guidance of 3%, recently having posted 5.1% growth between January 1, 2022 and September 30, 2023 (consisting of 1.6% of pricing growth and 3.5% of volume growth). ----- During the COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrated outstanding revenue growth, largely driven by our ability to capitalize on the SARS-CoV-2 testing opportunity and adapt to the changing macroeconomic environment. Between 2020 and 2022, our total COVID-19-related revenue was approximately €3.0 billion, with €618.0 million of COVID-19-related revenue in 2020, €1,579.0 million in 2021 and €€789.0 million in 2022. Over the same period our Adjusted EBITDA Margin averaged 27.1% and our Cash Conversion averaged 84.5%. While our COVID-19-related revenue declined in 2022 from its peak in 2021, our base revenue from our core business (excluding COVID-19-related revenue) posted 6.2% year-on-year revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2022, as a result of positive volume developments in routine (excluding SARS-CoV2) and specialty testing as well as positive price impacts driven by price indexation to inflation in certain regions while experiencing reimbursement reduction in others. Overall, revenue for our core business (excluding COVID-19-related revenue) grew at a 7.8% CAGR from €1,807.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to approximately €2,584.1 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we delivered organic revenue growth of 6.9% year-on-year (excluding COVID-19-related revenue), of which 5.4% was a result of increased volumes and the remaining 1.5% was a result of price growth. We expect our long-term revenue development to continue to be supported by favorable structural growth trends and benefit from our various retail initiatives, such as opening new blood collection points, strengthening our testing portfolios and D2C initiatives. During the period from 2020 through 2022, our Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased significantly from historic levels to 25.9% in 2020, 32.1% in 2021 and 23.2% in 2022, primarily as a result of the shift in business mix towards significantly higher margin SARS-CoV-2 testing. As illustrated below, our quarterly Adjusted EBITDA Margin declined through 2022 and has stabilized in 2023, albeit at a level that is below that seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating a clear path for further improvement. From 2022 through 2023 to date, COVID-19-related earnings have subsided significantly and our Adjusted EBITDA Margin declined to 16.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was also partially an outcome of the higher inflationary environment. We believe both SARS-CoV-2 testing, which has been impacting our business mix, and the current high inflation levels, which are impacting our personnel and operating expenses, are temporary factors that are affecting our business in the short term but are expected to normalize over the medium term. We expect 2023 to continue to be a year of normalization, with margins stabilizing as we refocus the business on core fundamentals. Going forward, we expect margin recovery to occur as a result of (i) nearterm factors, such as the elimination of costs incurred as a publicly listed company that are not expected to be incurred under private ownership and savings from the elimination of COVID-19-related personnel costs and (ii) mid-term broader cost optimization as we continue to focus on cost base improvements through the SALIX program. In addition, we expect further margin uplifts to result from operating as a private company following the Acquisition and from a ramp-up in the profitability of our Synnovis partnership in South East London with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, which is a 15-year contract that began in 2021. Although this contract was initially margin dilutive, it is expected to become accretive in the near term as we roll out a new centralized platform to replace the existing hospital laboratory systems. ----- We have a solid track-record of driving operational improvements and Adjusted EBITDA Margin expansion through several cost savings initiatives, particularly SALIX, our leading operational excellence program introduced in 2017. SALIX is executed locally, but systematically tracked centrally on an ongoing basis. SALIX is broadly categorized between material expenses, personnel expenses and operating expenses, focused on procurement efficiencies, headcount efficiencies, digitalization, automation and our laboratory footprint. Historically, we have delivered €20–25 million in cost savings each year across the SALIX program since inception and approximately €140 million since inception. In 2022, SALIX generated approximately €25 million in total savings helping to partially offset the change in business mix and inflationary pressure, with further ongoing savings expected over the medium term, including €45 million estimated for the year ending December 31, 2023, €30 million of which was delivered in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition to these cost savings, we have also generated savings on personnel costs through the reduction and ultimate elimination of headcount specifically allocated to COVID-19-related functions. As full-time capabilities related to COVID-19 are no longer driving significant revenue production as they did in 2021 and 2022, we have recalibrated our focus on allocating personnel in accordance with our underlying core business. Since mid-2023, we have not had any personnel specifically employed for COVID-19-related functions, which is down from 3,500 employees at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have maintained our 2023 outlook and are on track to deliver on our €2.7 billion revenue guidance (including greater than 4% organic growth), with 74% (€1,989.9 million) of 2023 revenue guidance having been achieved in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (or €1,924.0 million after taking into account acquisitions and disposals that occurred during the period). We also expect to reach our 16–18% Adjusted EBITDA Margin guidance for 2023 and continue on our path to margin expansion in the long term on the back of (i) stable volume growth, supported by geographical densification, improving operational and logistical efficiency with a positive impact on profitability as well as positive impact from changing business activity mix, with a view towards higher margin testing products in key geographies and (ii) productivity gains, including the continued impact of our initiatives such as digitalization, laboratory footprint optimization, the SYNLAB Transformation System (""STS"") discussed below, headcount efficiencies and automation. Reduced cost inflation, net of prices increases, could further result in a tailwind and tangible lever to our future organic margin expansion. Our strong track record of accretive acquisitions and synergies extraction, coupled with active portfolio management at all levels, is also expected to positively contribute to our long-term profitability development. Finally, our business benefits from relatively low levels of working capital and net capital expenditure, which comprises acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets net of disposals of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Due to our favorable business model, we are able to generate strong cash flow despite the temporary macro-economic headwinds described above, generating the capacity to de-lever while continuing to support our prudent acquisition strategy. Our Cash Conversion (excluding non-recurring capital expenditures of €11 million in 2021, €34 million in 2022 and €50 million the first nine months of 2023 related to the contract ramp-up of our Synnovis partnership agreement with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in South East London) was 89% in the year ended December 31, 2021, 84% in the year ended December 31, 2022 and 72% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Consolidation of the market is driven by the introduction of new regulation, increased pressure on margins, mandatory accreditations that increase costs for smaller players or individual laboratories, aging biologists close to retirement looking for an exit and the ability to compete against scaled players. With large parts of the market remaining unconsolidated, we have significant runway to further consolidate the market in our key regions. Since the formation of the SYNLAB Group in the second half of 2015 through the first threequarters of 2023, we completed 159 acquisitions (excluding additional acquisitions in business units that were sold during that period). While there is significant growth and consolidation potential remaining in ----- the market and we believe we are well-positioned to continue to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves, our M&A strategy is, and will, continue to be disciplined; it is fully aligned to our core strengths and additive to our organic growth levers. We have well-established processes and structures in place that allow us to evaluate and steer our targets from identification to due diligence and acquisition and on to the post-merger integration. These processes with clear criteria for M&A are at the core of our disciplined approach to acquisitions. The plans for postmerger integration that are drawn up ahead of an acquisition and diligent execution thereof give us the confidence that the expected value creation and deleveraging through synergies are aligned and achievable. We benefit from a dedicated team focused on finding, evaluating and executing external growth opportunities. We have developed a structured approach to acquisitions that capitalizes on the expertise and market knowledge of both our management and local laboratory doctors. Our management team has a strong track record of executing buy-and-build strategies through targeted acquisitions and the integration of laboratories into group operations. We have consistently expanded our laboratory networks through acquisitions. We have a clear track-record of implementing operational efficiencies to realize synergies, cost savings and drive improvements to gross and operating margins. Our size allows us to efficiently integrate and optimize laboratory operations, procurement functions and production processes through the identification of best practices and improving our information technology platforms. This includes our ability to extract advantageous procurement conditions with our suppliers, in particular through our Group-wide panEuropean framework supply agreements for reagents, calibrators, quality controls and automates. After acquiring clinical laboratories, we also implement efficiency measures aimed at increasing profitability leveraging the application of relevant best practices from across our network. We are also focused on optimization through a dynamic portfolio management strategy where we have divested certain businesses, with a focus on either (i) lower-margin businesses and geographies or (ii) selling assets where accretive multiples are achievable and using the proceeds to de-lever or reinvest in efficient operations. As part of this strategy, in July 2023, we completed the sale of our Swiss business, which had been dilutive to margins in recent years, allowing us to reduce our net debt by approximately €154 million, and, in September 2023, we completed the sale of our veterinary business in Belgium, Germany and Spain, disposing of a non-core business that accounted for less than 1% of our total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2022, resulting in net proceeds of approximately €194 million.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The voice of our experts is increasingly heard in all of the healthcare systems we work with and we aim to increase this active participation in the medical discussions of the topics of our time, as evidenced during the COVID19 pandemic. We also remain alert to changing trends in testing patterns and continue to introduce new tests that position us at the forefront of the medical diagnostics field. Leveraging this medical expertise, we will continue providing customers with accurate test results with the highest possible medical precision, the shortest possible turnaround time and the lowest possible analysis error rate. Customer experience is also enhanced via additional services (e.g., counselling services pre- and post-test). In addition to this, we will also continue to roll out ""SYNLAB Access,"" an intuitive digitalized tool with a focus on enhancing the patient journey. As some healthcare systems are coming under significant budgetary pressures, public and private hospitals, organizations and other healthcare providers are seeking to improve the productivity and the medical quality of their services by outsourcing inefficient and sub-scale laboratory activities to diagnostics experts. We are well-placed to take advantage of this trend as we can provide a full spectrum of outsourcing solutions, ranging from referral testing services to full outsourcing with the transfer of entire teams and assets, most notably in France, Finland, Germany, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. For example, we have been entrusted with the largest hospital outsourcing contract ever granted in the United Kingdom; the Synnovis partnership in South East London with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. This project aims to deliver a capital efficient service modernization program with leading service digitalization, implementing digital pathology, allowing access to our global clinical network, driving reduction of laboratory estates and cost of testing. This experience and track record positions us well as more hospital systems consider outsourcing. Under the growth initiatives program ""For You,"" we systematically implement campaigns in each country and enhance sales force effectiveness with prescribers, develop connectivity with clinicians and tools for demand management. We also continuously reinforce our medical leadership, reputation and establish clinical partnerships. At the same time, we continually increase the number of specialty tests in order to provide a broader service offering across our network, for example by continuing to identify and introducing testing services in various geographies and therefore creating a consistent and increasing panEuropean products and services offering driving further growth. ----- We also invest significantly in selected areas, such as patient and doctor interfaces to increase client-base proximity and in AI technologies to enhance customer service and satisfaction propositions. Moreover, we have launched our D2C proposition focusing on prevention and wellness. Leveraging our extensive experience in running a web shop in Estonia that we have operated since 2017, pilot D2C projects were launched in the United Kingdom and Italy in 2022 and subsequently expanded to Portugal, Spain, France and Hungary. We expect this market to evolve and capture a growing share of the medical diagnostics market. We are also focused on leveraging our scientific and operational know-how to deliver our sophisticated propositions in higher growth emerging markets, mainly with respect to Latin America (including Colombia, Mexico, Chile and Peru) and Africa (Nigeria and Ghana).",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Strategy,9.5.2,"We will sustain our focus on innovation and operational excellence by leveraging our scale, capabilities and supplier relationships to drive operating efficiencies and profitability.","We utilize technological innovations like state-of-the-art software, AI and digitalization to further improve our diagnostic service processes and simplify our business. For example, our implementation of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) simplifies our reporting formats and addresses audit regulations. Similarly, digitalization in diagnostic services enables us to support the work of our colleagues and employees. This also helps us work efficiently with physicians and improves how they deliver treatment and medical care. We have also established a team that will leverage AI to refine our customer solutions offering, based on our proprietary data, which will further help us pioneer new opportunities. Our strategy is to focus on providing decision support through rule-based annotation support, develop demand control tools and enable virtual consultation by means of digital communication. This not only positions us to deliver stronger customer experience but also reduces costs by leveraging technology and improving operations. We intend to continue leveraging our extensive network to streamline our laboratory operations and administrative functions and to strengthen our post-merger integration processes and capabilities while enhancing our service offering. In doing so, we aim to continue reducing our operating costs through operational efficiency improvements across our laboratory network and the optimization of procurement contracts at lower costs. This is captured under our SALIX program, which is focused on regaining preCOVID-19 pandemic productivity and is driven by implementing identified global initiatives including procurement contracts, targeted COVID-19 employee and other personnel reductions, supply chain management, process standardization and digitalization. SALIX is underpinned by three key pillars. The first pillar is procurement (captured under material expenditure). We seek to leverage our scale to save on direct and indirect costs, thereby reducing materials costs and operating expenses. The second pillar is the SYNLAB Transformation System (""STS""), which is based on Lean Six Sigma principles (automation, workspace design, planning and scheduling, multi-skilled workforce, standardization, performance management). STS is a management system supporting our strategy and is considered the engine driving us to operational excellence by enabling customer centricity, productivity increases and a healthy organization. STS also has the effect of reducing operating (captured under operational expenditure) and personnel expenses (captured under personnel expenditure). All cost savings from STS are transferred into SALIX. The third pillar is focused on our laboratory network, including refining our ""hub"" and ""spoke"" network, ensuring it has superior logistics and reliable technical service and maintenance functions. This pillar also has the effect of reducing operating and personnel expenses. In 2022, SALIX generated cost savings of €25 million, with savings of material expenses accounting for 42%, personnel expenses for 22% and operational expenses for 35%. In addition, we are focused on network optimization, especially in areas with limited density of blood collection points, which impacts margins. We actively manage our blood collection point network either by opening or refurbishing existing blood collection points or acquiring blood collection points locally to expand our reach and extend our scale. Within blood collection points, we are rolling out the STS across the platform, resulting in lower waiting times, improved NPS scores and increasing revenue from out-ofpocket services.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Strategy,9.5.3,We will develop our talent by empowering and engaging our employees.,"To deliver a best-in-class service for our patients and customers, we rely on committed and qualified people. Employees are the interface to patients and customers and are critical to our success. ----- Employee engagement, with the objective of driving enhanced organizational performance, is a key pillar of our strategy. This effort is reflected in three Group-wide initiatives: (i) the SYNLAB Leadership Model (ACCE), (ii) the SYNLAB Campus and (iii) SYNLAB Dialogue. The SYNLAB Leadership Model (ACCE) is a proprietary model of leadership training that aims to align individual management actions to the principles and values shared within the company. The SYNLAB Campus is one of the core platforms for people development, focused on creating a new way of working based on a culture of collaboration and reflecting our values of passion, accountability and customer centricity. SYNLAB Campus provides professional development courses and training to enhance personal and professional effectiveness, as well as further Group-level initiatives. SYNLAB Dialogue is a Group-wide annual survey that gives employees an opportunity to anonymously share their views with the organization and is intended to serve as a base for improving our human capital and driving continuous improvements to continue to be recognized as a great place to work. In addition, our human resources strategy is also focused on establishing successful talent and succession management programs, establishing an environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") company culture that demonstrates commitment to corporate social responsibility and sustainability and enables clear performance management processes throughout the organization. Other programs implemented include acknowledgement of employee contributions (e.g., by offering medical awards and research grants), dual education opportunities and the creation of a work environment that minimizes the risk of accidents. We have a strong focus on ESG with a dedicated board committee monitoring the progress of our ESG strategy. It is based on three pillars, SYNLAB Green, SYNLAB Care and SYNLAB Citizenship. Our new central laboratories including our Synnovis partnership agreement with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in South East London, our new central laboratory in Munich, Germany and ongoing construction of a new medical center in Florence, Italy adhere to the highest ESG standards.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Strategy,9.5.4,"We will pursue growth and profitability opportunities through efficient capital allocation, investments in our business and selective acquisitions / divestments in current and new markets.","We operate a highly cash generative model, with a major focus on accounts receivable and managing capital expenditure efficiently. Ensuring capital is efficiently allocated to facilitate growth opportunities is critical. From 2018 through 2022, we invested around €110 million per year on average in targeted infrastructure developments to support our operational excellence strategy. Infrastructure investments typically include new blood collection points and commercial activities, logistics infrastructure, diagnostic centers, improvements in existing laboratory and blood collection point facilities, laboratory equipment, customer interaction and end-user service platforms, as well as back office and IT. In 2021, beyond the normal investments in our core activities and in further response to the COVID-19 pandemic, significant investments were made to set up appropriate SARS-CoV-2 testing capabilities across the network. These investments position us well for the medium term, with fewer one-off capital expenditures expected and better control over leases expansion going forward. We also benefit from a prudent and disciplined external growth strategy, focused on a balanced and lower, as compared to previous years, annual spend in the medium term (approximately €75 million investment on M&A as of September 30, 2023, in line with our planned reduction in 2023 from levels of M&A spending in prior years) and increased focus on accretive bolt-on acquisitions as opposed to transformative and large-scale deals, with tangible scope to generate operational efficiencies and synergies. Our ability to integrate these acquisitions and extract cost savings are a key contributor to our profitability. We are typically able to realize synergies within 12–24 months from acquisition, primarily by optimizing costs through group level advantages in procurement and other functions and through streamlining personnel expenses, leveraging group supplier contracts and existing group and regional support functions. We also have a disciplined approach to entry price, focusing on post-synergies valuations of approximately 9-12x EBITDA. Given our strong cash flow performance, we can generally self-finance planned acquisitions, mostly made up of highly accretive bolt-on acquisitions. Generally, we see ourselves in a strong financial position to continue consolidating the market and creating value from our own resources. In 2023, we have temporarily ----- reduced our M&A spending from historic levels to fully focus the business on achieving the same productivity level as before the COVID-19 pandemic. Separately, we have an active portfolio management strategy. We continuously monitor performance at the level of countries, segments, entity, contract or customer groups, with a reinforced focus on countries or segments with low margins (less than 10% Adjusted EBITDA Margin), divesting lower performing assets or assets that can be sold at highly accretive multiples. We evaluate market structure, degree of consolidation, critical scale required in the market, organic growth of laboratory testing services in the country and reimbursement and regulation trends. While the most immediate focus is on assets with Adjusted EBITDA Margins below 10%, we also aim to decrease the revenue contribution of businesses with margins below 20% (which contributed approximately 52% of our revenue in the first half of 2023) and look for opportunities to simplify our business model. The completed sale of our veterinary diagnostics business in Belgium, Germany and Spain in September 2023 and of our business operations in Switzerland in July 2023, are outcomes of such evaluation. These businesses were sold for attractive multiples and were margin accretive for the whole Group, with cash inflow from the sale of subsidiaries, net of cash disposed and changes in debt having amounted to €346 million. The proceeds have been reinvested and utilized for the purposes of deleveraging (including repaying in full €220 million of term loan B debt under a facility that was outstanding at the time in July 2023).",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

We had no significant expenses for strategic group projects in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 or the year ended December 31, 2022. Strategic group project costs amounted to €21.3 million in 2021 and €13.0 million in 2020. Strategic project costs consist of costs associated with strategic projects as part of our wider business transformation program, including our initial public offering in 2021, and include costs relating to our group-wide enterprise resource planning system and other significant IT implementation programs. These costs were considered not to meet our policy for capitalization of software development costs in accordance with IAS 38. In 2021, strategic project costs related to our initial public offering. In 2020, strategic project costs included €7.4 million of costs incurred in preparation for a potential change in our capital structure. Costs of strategic IT projects included €5.5 million incurred in 2020 in connection with, among other things, the implementation of the ERP system. We had no significant expenses for restructuring resulting from acquisitions, significant relocation and internal reorganization in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 or the year ended December 31, 2022. Expenses for restructuring resulting from acquisitions, significant relocation and internal reorganization programs amounted to €1.5 million in 2021 and €4.1 million in 2020. In 2021, these expenses related to costs associated with our ongoing merger and acquisition activity. In 2020, these expenses consisted primarily of costs relating to various restructuring projects, including a major restructuring project in Switzerland. (b) For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, transaction costs for acquisition projects that we completed or abandoned amounted to €12.5 million and included €13.1 million of legal and consulting expenses and €0.6 million in release of provisions for earn-outs relating to previous acquisitions. For 2022, transaction costs for acquisition projects that we completed or abandoned amounted to €6.9 million and included €11.0 million of legal and consulting expenses and €4.1 million in release of provisions for earn-outs relating to previous acquisitions. For 2021, transaction costs for acquisition projects that we completed or abandoned amounted to €7.1 million and included €4.0 million of legal and consulting expenses and €3.1 million in additional earn-outs relating to previous acquisitions that exceeded provision amounts as our significant growth resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic impacted earn-out agreements. For 2020, transaction costs for acquisition projects that we completed or abandoned amounted to €1.9 million and included €2.7 million of legal and consulting expenses and €0.8 million in release of provisions for earn-outs relating to previous acquisitions. (c) Impairment of non-current assets in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to amortization of software that had become obsolete. Impairment of non-current assets in 2022 related to a €213.0 million impairment of goodwill relating to our German business principally as a consequence of the impact of the overall geopolitical situation on our German business, specifically the rise in the yield of the 30-year German government bond that increased our weighted average cost of capital and the high inflationary environment that weakened our business outlook in Germany. There were no impairments of non-current assets in 2021. Impairment of non-current assets in 2020 primarily related to an impairment of goodwill for our operations in Switzerland in an amount of €115.0 million due to commercial challenges in Switzerland (which was at the time included in our South segment). (d) Amortization of customer relationships relates to customer relationships recognized as part of the purchase price allocation for the acquisitions that we completed. ----- (e) Operating depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of property, plant and equipment, depreciation of right-of-use assets and amortization of other intangible assets.

(i) Illustrative run-rate adjustments reflect (i) the full-period impact of SALIX savings from initiatives implemented in 2023, as initiatives are typically implemented part-way through the year, amounting to €8.0 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023; (ii) expected productivity improvement in the year ending December 31, 2024, primarily resulting from the reduction of headcount of personnel dedicated to COVID-19-related testing, amounting to €7.6 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023; and (iii) the margin improvement expected in the long term for our Synnovis partnership agreement with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in South East London as the contract matures and cost savings are delivered through the migration of services from legacy hospital systems to our central laboratories, amounting to €9.1 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. (j) Given the decline and normalization of COVID-19-related EBITDA, Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA reflects an adjustment to reduce COVID19-related EBITDA in each period to the level at which it is expected going forward. The adjustment amounts to €(16.8) million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. (3) We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the applicable period.

The full-year contribution from the acquisitions made during period n-1 consists of the estimate of revenue recognized by the newly acquired companies prior to the date on which they were added to the perimeter of consolidation; - organic growth for acquisitions that took place during period n is calculated by subtracting revenue generated by the businesses acquired between the date on which they joined the perimeter of consolidation and the end of period n; - organic growth for disposals that took place during period n is calculated by subtracting revenue generated by the businesses disposed of between the start of period n-1 and the date on which they exited the perimeter of consolidation; and - the percentage of organic growth is then calculated as the ratio of (x) revenue in period n restated for the acquisitions completed during period n divided by (y) revenue in period n-1 adjusted for the impact of the acquisitions completed during period n-1. Organic growth is a non-IFRS measure calculating the growth in revenue for a given period compared to the comparable period of the prior year for the same scope of businesses, excluding discontinued operations, and in constant currency (i.e., using the exchange rates of the prior year reported period.

504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Industry,13.1.1,We operate in a highly regulated sector. Compliance with regulations applicable to our activities may increase operating costs or restrict activities and failure to comply with such regulations may lead to penalties of various types.,"The medical diagnostics industry (including clinical laboratory testing) is subject to extensive regulations and controls by various regulatory authorities in each of the countries in which we operate. Those regulations and controls have a significant influence on the way we carry out activities. For clinical laboratories, those regulations mainly pertain to operating requirements, professional qualifications of laboratory personnel, ownership and corporate governance constraints on companies that operate laboratories, and the pricing and reimbursement levels of clinical tests. Our activities are also subject to numerous other laws and regulations, particularly as regards the handling and storing of certain chemicals and reagents, the disposal of biological waste (i.e., waste from activities that carry a risk of infection), the handling and storage of personal data (including patients' medical records and test results), relationships with doctors and hospitals (including laws and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and regulating gifts and fringe benefits) and the prevention of fraud to social security systems. Compliance with such regulations is closely monitored by the relevant administrative authorities in the countries and regions in which we operate, as well as by the competent professional associations. Compliance with current or future laws and regulations entails significant costs and any regulatory developments may cause an increase in our administrative, legal and operational expenditure, forcing us to alter our commercial practices, legal organization, ownership structure and corporate governance of subsidiaries or, more generally, reduce or limit our revenue. Failure to comply with such regulations may also lead to sanctions of various kinds for us and potentially for laboratory doctors working for us. Sanctions may be administrative (e.g., fines, periodic penalty payments, temporary or permanent closures of laboratories), disciplinary (e.g., temporary or permanent removal of the right to practice), civil (e.g., damages), or criminal (e.g., a ban on operating a clinical laboratory or imprisonment). If we fail to comply with applicable regulations, if they change or are interpreted in a manner adverse to us or if we cannot maintain, renew or secure required permits, licenses, accreditations, agreements or other necessary administrative authorizations, we may be unable to pursue activities or market our services in the relevant jurisdictions, be excluded from participating in public healthcare programs, no longer be able to enter into contracts with third-party payers, suffer penalties or civil and criminal fines, or be subject to complaints by third parties, with the financial consequences that may result. If we cannot respond effectively to regulatory and market changes, our outlook and results of operations could be adversely affected. These laws and regulations, the extent of some of which have not been fully interpreted by courts, may require us to modify our operations or impose additional compliance expenses or burdens or give rise to administrative fines and penalties. For example, French regulatory reforms imposing stricter International Organization for Standardization (""ISO"") operating standards (namely ISO 15189) and introducing minimum accreditation standards for laboratories, have resulted in a costly and time-consuming implementation process. The laboratory accreditation process involves the preparation of written applications, site studies and assessment of the scope of changes required to comply with new standards, the appointment of external qualified experts, the training of our staff, the participation of our staff in the process in addition to their usual workload, the payment of certain administrative fees and the ----- implementation of new quality software. Accreditation may be delayed based on many factors, including the number of sites operated by a medical laboratory and the responsiveness of the accreditation body, COFRAC (Comité français d'accréditation). Although we have already undertaken to conduct our business in compliance with these heightened standards, any further changes in laws and regulations may require us to further modify our operations. Changes affecting certain regulations or government programs that are not directly connected with the medical diagnostics sector, for example, relating to prescription control, co-payment, doctors, health insurers and hospitals, may also affect us and impair our results of operations and ability to expand our activities. In all of the aforementioned cases, our reputation could be damaged and important relationships with government regulators, or third parties could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Industry,13.1.2,The prices we may charge in certain markets are set by government-enforced rates that are often decreasing.,"In many countries, our activities are subject to regulated rates (particularly for clinical services) because our services are provided under public health programs funded partly or entirely by governments. As a result, most of the clinical testing services we provide are subject to prices or required rate-determination methods that are generally set by governmental authorities and we have only limited influence on them. Rates may be revised at any time and past revisions have involved reductions in rates. Tariff decreases may reduce our margins and may adversely affect revenue from testing services and results of operations or even the feasibility of providing certain testing services by some or all of our laboratories. Further tariff decreases in the countries in which we operate are possible and any such decreases could be significant. For the year ended December 31, 2022, nearly all of our revenue from human medicine in our core market countries of France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom was generated from services for which prices are directly or indirectly regulated by governmental authorities. Tariffs or volume quotas are often established by or negotiated with governments and other authorities or regulatory bodies, and we have limited or no influence over the levels at which they are set. Governments typically control healthcare expenditure by reducing rates or reimbursement levels, seeking to reduce the number of tests prescribed by doctors and limiting the testing services covered by their health, welfare or social security programs. Government reimbursement schemes often limit the range of tests that are covered and certain pre-existing or innovative tests that provide higher margins to us may be excluded from such coverage. In countries where prices are not currently regulated, government price containment measures may impact our activities, since the public healthcare system covers most of the population. In general, we expect increased constraints on government-regulated tariffs to continue. In recent years, many European governments have announced or undertaken measures aimed at curbing spending, including healthcare expenditures, and may institute further policies designed to lower healthcare expenditures. As a result of such policies, changes in medical guidelines could lead to lower volumes of recurring tests, which could have a negative impact on our business. For example, the French government encourages healthcare professionals to limit the number of tests prescribed. Furthermore, governments tend to reduce in greater proportion tariff levels on tests that are administered in high volumes, which has a multiplying effect on our results as the tests performed in high volumes tend to be impacted by larger tariff cuts, and we may not be able to offset the impact of lower tariff levels by increasing testing volumes accordingly. Policies that limit or decrease the amounts we may charge for our services or exclude coverage of certain of our services from public health programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Industry,13.1.3,We face efforts by non-governmental third-party payers—mainly private health insurers—to reduce utilization and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing services.,"In certain markets, we receive payment for our services from private health insurers that have gained significant bargaining power by only reimbursing healthcare services if such services are provided by preselected providers. Furthermore, in certain markets, private health insurers directly negotiate fee ----- structures with healthcare providers, including clinical laboratories. Certain private health insurers have insisted on discounted fee structures as a condition for preselection in the past and may insist on further discounted fee structures in the future. If we are not preselected by private health insurers or are required to accept unfavorable terms to secure such preselection, our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected. Private health insurers have also exerted pricing pressure on hospitals which, in turn, have exerted pricing pressure on us. Such pricing pressure on hospitals and other parties with which we conduct business reduces such parties' margins and may cause such parties to default on their obligations to us. In certain markets where private insurance supplements public healthcare, private health insurers may seek to control their costs by reducing levels of reimbursement under their insurance plans, requiring the patient to pay any shortfall or an increased amount of shortfall. Such efforts by third-party payers to reduce the utilization of clinical laboratory testing services, or their exposure to risks associated with such utilization, and reimbursement levels on the services we provide, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Future economic downturns may lead governments, public health authorities, private health insurers and patients to further reduce their expenditures on healthcare. Where patients are directly or indirectly responsible for all or part of the cost of laboratory tests, individual decisions to reduce healthcare expenditures may result in a reduction in demand for our services. A decrease in household disposable income, or the perception thereof, in times of economic downturn can lead to a reduction in individuals' healthcare expenditures. This may result in patients postponing certain types of medical treatment and could result in a significant decrease in our test volumes and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Industry,13.1.4,Weak economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our activities.,"Economic downturns and volatility, including as a result or an escalation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine or the recent escalation of conflict in the Middle East and the associated effects on the global economy including material increases in global inflation, energy prices and interest rates since early 2022 which have also had profound effects in 2023, increases our risks associated with conducting activities. Such risks include the risk of default by customers on their payment obligations to us. Economic difficulties also result in reduced levels of activities and higher unemployment and can cause governments, private health insurers and other third parties to reduce their healthcare spending, which may affect our revenue or margins. Our customers include large companies to which we provide clinical laboratory testing services for their employees. However, economic conditions in those countries have led and might continue to lead to bankruptcies, headcount reductions, hiring freezes and financial difficulties for certain of our corporate customers, prompting them to reduce testing services volumes. In addition to volume reductions or payment defaults, an economic downturn may result in downward pressure on prices and therefore on margins. Where patients, directly or indirectly (such as through private health insurance premiums) are responsible for all or part of the cost of medical tests, individual decisions to reduce healthcare expenditures may result in a reduction of demand for our services. More generally, a decrease in household disposable incomes, or merely the perception thereof, in times of economic downturn can lead to a reduction in individuals' healthcare expenditure, including private insurance coverage and the level of such coverage, regardless of the level of reimbursement by public social security systems. Any such reduction in our services could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Industry,13.1.5,"Inflation has adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our material, personnel and operating expenses.","Inflationary factors such as increases in labor costs, material costs and overhead costs have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our material, personnel and operating expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our overall Group costs were 3.4% higher as a result of the impact of inflations, including impacts of 2.3%, 3.8% and 3.7% for our material, personnel and operating expenses, respectively, during the period. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our overall Group costs were 3.1% higher as a result of the impact of inflations, including impacts of 1.8%, 2.7% and 6.0% for our material, personnel and operating expenses, respectively, during the period. ----- Inflationary pressures may also increase other costs related to our business. For example, material increases in global inflation will impact how regulators view prices and may affect the 2% growth assumption in our main markets. As a result, we may not be able to fully recover increased costs due to inflation from our customers. Continuing or worsening inflation could significantly increase our operating expenses and capital expenditures, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and our ability to service our indebtedness, including the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Industry,13.1.6,Increased quality and price competition could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.,"The medical diagnostics market, including clinical testing services, is intensely competitive. In markets where fee structures are regulated, accounting for approximately half of our revenue, competition is based mostly on the quality of services provided. Reputation in the medical community is a key factor affecting the volume of testing services we provide in such markets, since healthcare professionals are an important source of patient referrals to our laboratories. In other market segments not subject to regulatory pricing, we also compete on the basis of price. Such services include, in particular, testing services pursuant to hospital outsourcing agreements and testing paid out-of-pocket by customers in certain countries. Our main competitors, some of whom are also clients, include large multinational companies, national companies in certain countries and numerous small local companies. Pricing is also a key driver in outsourcing decisions of hospital laboratories, for which the main objective is cost reduction. We may not be able to offer services similar to, or more desirable than those of our competitors or at a price comparable to that of our competitors in all segments where prices are freely negotiated. In addition, we face competition from both public and private diagnostic service providers based on their areas of scientific and advanced expertise, the geographical footprint of their networks, their ability to process samples and report data accurately and in a timely manner, their historical experience and customer relationships and the quality of their facilities. Existing or new competitors could develop close relationships with our hospital and medical professional customers in our markets and compete for referrals, which could have a direct impact on business, either through market share losses or price reductions. The ongoing consolidation of the European clinical laboratory industry is expected to enable larger groups to offer lower prices as they adopt large-scale automated testing allowing them to reduce their costs. The resulting testing procedures are particularly likely to induce increased cost reductions. As a result of the size and structure of our network, we may be unable to achieve competitive levels of efficiency and may lose customers or tenders as a result. In some markets, scale and geographic reach provide competitive advantages because private health insurers prefer negotiating national contracts with networks that have a substantial geographic footprint and offer them more favorable terms. Our ability to compete effectively may be adversely affected if we do not have an extensive enough network in some of the markets in which we operate, as compared to competitors with greater financial resources, stronger market positions or broader geographical reach. If we are unable to successfully compete, this will adversely affect our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to Our Business,13.2.1,We face risks associated with our strategy of acquiring companies.,"Our growth strategy includes acquiring small- and medium-sized laboratories and integrating them into our network. The continued success of our strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets, conduct appropriate due diligence, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, complete such transactions and integrate the acquired businesses into our business. Continued consolidation of the European medical diagnostics market, including clinical laboratory testing services, or adverse macroeconomic conditions may limit opportunities for further acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy is also exposed to competitive pressures from competitors with similar acquisition strategies or certain financial investors wishing to enter the market, either of which may have greater financial resources than us. ----- Furthermore, acquisitions involve the integration of a company that previously operated independently with systems and processes that differ from those used by us. We may not be able to integrate certain acquired companies successfully or the integration may require more time and investment than expected. Additionally, we could bear or assume unknown or unexpected liabilities or risks related to customers, employees, suppliers, competent administrative authorities, professional associations, public health programs, private health insurers or other persons. If we are unable to implement our acquisition strategy or integrate acquired companies successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to Our Business,13.2.2,We may be unable to successfully manage and integrate acquisitions or achieve anticipated synergies and cost saving adjustments.,"Our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and achieve anticipated synergies is dependent upon a significant number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control. If one or more of the underlying assumptions proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to fully achieve, or achieve in the anticipated timeframe, any benefits from executed acquisitions. Generally, when we acquire businesses, we identify anticipated synergies that are expected to materialize after the combination of the acquired business with us. Achieving synergies can be difficult and uncertain, and the process of integrating acquired businesses involves risks. These risks include, but are not limited to: - diversion of management's time and attention from daily operations to the integration of newly acquired operations; - difficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures, practices and sales and distribution methodologies; - difficulties in conforming the acquired company's accounting system, books and records, internal accounting controls, and procedures and policies to those we use; - retaining the loyalty and business of the customers of acquired businesses; - retaining employees who may be vital to the integration of the acquired business or to the future prospects of the combined businesses; - difficulties and unanticipated expenses related to the integration and standardization of information technology systems, especially financial reporting and accounting systems; - difficulties in maintaining timeliness and quality of service; - difficulties in complying with different regulatory environments; - unforeseen challenges of operating in new geographic areas; and - unanticipated costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities. Failure to successfully transfer business operations and otherwise integrate acquired businesses may result in reduced levels of revenue, operating efficiency or profitability compared to what we historically achieved or might have achieved if we had not acquired such businesses, as well as the loss of customers of the acquired businesses. In addition, we may not be able to realize the potential savings identified in our pro _forma adjustments as a consequence of the Target's delisting form the Frankfurt Stock Exchange._",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to Our Business,13.2.3,We have recognized a significant amount of goodwill and may never realize the full value of that goodwill.,"We have recognized a significant amount of goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net assets of companies acquired. Our goodwill amounted to €2,268.5 million as of September 30, 2023, equal to 45.5% of our total assets. Under IFRS, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is any indication of impairment. Impairment may result ----- from, among other things, a deterioration in our performance, a decline in expected future cash flows, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations (including changes that restrict the activities of, or affect the services provided by, our laboratories) and various other factors. For example, in 2022 we recorded a €213.0 million impairment of goodwill relating to our German business principally as a consequence of the impact of the overall geopolitical situation on our German business, specifically the rise in the yield of the 30-year German government bond that increased our weighted average cost of capital and the high inflationary environment that weakened our business outlook in Germany. The amount of any impairment must be reported immediately as a charge to our income statement and cannot be reversed. Any future goodwill impairments can materially adversely affect our results of operation.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

If any tests administered or distributed by us are subject to a drop-in quality or timeliness or prove to be, or are accused of being, harmful to customers or inaccurate, this could adversely impact demand for our products. Negative publicity with respect to the quality of our tests could have the same effect. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we became highly visible in the media. High visibility in the media could expose us to increased public scrutiny and shifts in public opinion, influenced by, among other things, any perception that providers of clinical laboratory and medical diagnostics services have improperly capitalized on the COVID-19 pandemic for financial gain, delays from SARS-CoV-2 or other test backlogs in laboratories due to extreme demand, perception of false positive/negative results due to human errors or limitations in current testing technology, loss of samples, data privacy breaches or reporting errors. Negative changes of market perceptions with respect to our services could negatively affect our relationships with national authorities, prohibit future service contracts with public or private clients or impact demand for our services.

If we were to lose one or more key customers, or if the contracts with these customers are renewed at reduced prices, our revenue could be affected.","The success of our business depends, in part, on large customer contracts entered into with private insurance companies, local or regional health care providers or hospital chains and on our group-wide pan-European framework supply agreements for reagents. For example, in November 2020, we entered into a partnership agreement, valued at £1,865 million over 15 years, with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust to become the London Trusts' new pathology partner and transform and deliver pathology services across South East London. Other large contracts may be longterm contracts with terms of up to five years. We may not be able to renew or extend contracts on favorable terms and we may lose significant business to competitors at upcoming expiries. While no individual customer contract is material to our revenue generation, failure to maintain or establish new contracts may negatively impact our growth strategy, geographic footprint and future prospects. If we are unable to comply with quality requirements, legal and regulatory requirements or the required service level related to any contract, there could be a risk that we would lose such a contract and the related revenue and profits.

Inaccuracies or negligence in providing clinical testing services may lead to inaccurate diagnoses by healthcare professionals, prescriptions of inappropriate treatments or decisions not to prescribe treatment when treatment is required, which may have serious consequences for patients (including illness, harm, death or other adverse effects). Errors such as misidentifying or inaccurately labeling samples or compromising the integrity of samples, as well as errors caused by testing machines or reagents used for testing, may occur. Claims and litigation against us may result in liability for the harm or other adverse effects caused. We have been the subject of legal proceedings for alleged acts or omissions of our laboratory personnel and other employees in the past. If we are involved in such proceedings in the future, even if we are successful in our defense, the proceedings could be costly, could distract management from executing our strategy and could result in substantial damage to our reputation in the medical community and with patients.

These larger or strategically important laboratory sites are critical to our operations in certain regional or national markets. There is a risk of business interruption at these sites, which could be the result of external factors such as lack of testing supplies, natural disasters, fire, vandalism, cyberattacks or other unforeseen events. Business interruption could also be the result of internal factors such as failure to comply with regulatory requirements and the resulting loss of authorizations to operate the facility. While our key laboratories remained open and operational during the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot rule out the possibility that future events that have a similar or comparable impact on operations such as ours could result in closures of our laboratories or other facilities. Business interruptions could have a significant adverse impact on our business, both from direct losses of revenue and profits related to the affected laboratory site and through the reputational damage that such a business interruption could have on our business.

In certain countries we bill patients directly for the majority of our services, in others we invoice the public healthcare system and in others we invoice private or public hospitals directly for the majority of services performed. Collection efforts for amounts due can be difficult, especially from patients in countries where there is no primary government payer of healthcare expenses. If a third-party payer or a company with which we have a contractual relationship experiences financial difficulties, we may be unable to collect amounts payable to us, resulting in write-offs of such debt. We maintain reserves for doubtful accounts and amounts past due. However, there can be no assurances that such reserves will be sufficient for the thirdparty credit risks we face.

The vehicles used to transport samples must satisfy applicable legal, practical and technical requirements, which vary depending on the type of samples transported. These requirements govern, for example, the use of appropriate containers and packaging, the labeling of containers, the manner in which samples and containers are stored in the vehicle, the temperature at which samples must be transported and the duration of the journey. Drivers employed to transport samples must be trained to handle them in accordance with best practice and applicable laws and regulations. Mishandling of the sample in the collection and transportation process may increase the likelihood of errors in laboratory testing. In addition, efficient transportation of samples is key to our business. Our business operates on a model of numerous satellite and emergency laboratory sites and blood collection points where samples are collected and, if testing is not conducted on site at the local laboratory, it is delivered to our European reference laboratories or national hub or regional laboratory sites where testing takes place. Disruption to the collection and transportation of samples, failure to comply with requirements relating to samples or the inadequate performance of the transportation service may damage our reputation, lead to claims against us and/or result in the loss of customers and patients, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in certain of the countries in which we operate, we have entered into outsourcing arrangements with third parties for the transportation of medical samples from specified sampling points (such as hospital ----- sites or doctors' surgeries) to our clinical laboratories.

Increases in employee wages or the scarcity of specialized laboratory knowledge in the labor market could also result in higher labor costs. In 2022, labor inflation increased above historic levels, with the exception of France and Switzerland. Additionally, labor laws applicable to our business in certain countries can be complex and leave room for interpretation. Labor law authorities or courts may have a different interpretation than we do. In numerous cases, labor laws provide for the strong protection of employees' interests, which we are required to observe.

IT problems may impact the ability to carry out tests, deliver test results, bill for tests in due time or maintain the privacy of the medical data we collect, all of which may disrupt our activities. IT systems may be subject to physical or electronic attacks, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems that may materially adversely affect our ability to function. This can be caused by events such as ransomware attacks, theft of data or patient health information, hacking of testing equipment leading to wrong test results, or gateway attacks into our customers' systems (e.g., general practitioners or hospitals).

For the majority of tests, we do not develop our own tests or technologies, but rather we rely on equipment suppliers and test developers. The clinical laboratory industry faces challenges from regularly changing technology and new product introductions. Other companies, including our competitors, may obtain patents, licenses or other rights that may prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to license and provide particular tests or may increase the costs of doing so. Additionally, demand for outsourced tests may decline. Our customers include public and private hospitals that choose to outsource their testing, usually because they lack the expertise or the resources to conduct the testing themselves in a cost-effective manner. Some of our customers or patients, including hospitals and doctors, may choose to perform tests themselves that we currently perform. Advances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective tests that can be performed outside a commercial clinical laboratory, such as specialty tests that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories, point-of-care tests that can be performed by doctors in their surgeries, or home testing that can be performed by patients or other non-medical professionals (such as test kits that already exist for blood sugar testing). For example, integrated genetic diagnostic testing services, offered by certain professional websites and hardware suppliers, may also reduce activity levels for our laboratories. Manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits may seek to increase their sales by marketing tests that can be performed in surgeries or directly by patients. In addition, consumer healthcare technology companies may succeed in developing novel approaches to laboratory diagnostics testing, including alternative methods of sample collection and testing that replace traditional methods.

As a consequence, our IT systems may be vulnerable to and experience difficulties or disruptions that impact our ability to operate. IT systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or other network failures, individual acts and natural disasters. Historically, we have grown through acquisitions, and, as a consequence, newly acquired laboratories often use older software platforms that are not consistent with our systems.

We are subject to legal obligations relating to respect for, and the protection of, personal data—particularly patients' medical records—and strict policies relating to information security. The handling of confidential and personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to regulation and government approval in numerous jurisdictions around the world with increasingly stringent oversight and penalties in case of breach. We are subject to privacy and data protection regulations with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information. Such regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including: - the circumstances under which the use or disclosure of protected medical health information is permitted or required without specific authorization by the patient; - a patients' rights to access, ask for amendments to and receive, protected information contained in their medical records; - requirements to notify patients of privacy measures to maintain the confidentiality of protected medical information; - administrative, technical and physical backups required of entities that use or receive protected medical information; and - the protection of computing systems that store protected health information. ----- For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR""), effective as of May 2018, which imposes significant fines and sanctions for violations of the GDPR and is applicable to us and to all companies processing data of EU residents.

In France, we are subject to regulatory constraints that restrict the ownership of the share capital and voting rights of Société d'exercice libéral (""SELs"") by persons other than the laboratory doctors practicing within such SELs. A SEL is a form of limited liability company, governed by French laws and regulations, in which regulated liberal practitioners such as physicians (médecins) and laboratory doctors (biologistes _médicaux) may jointly practice their professional activity._ In order to comply with these regulations, we initially established a legal structure under which we directly and indirectly held shares representing around 99.9% of the share capital and financial rights of the SELs, while certain laboratory doctors practicing within such SELs (""Practicing Biologists"") held the remainder of the shares, representing at least 50% of the voting rights in the shareholders meetings of the SELs in accordance with applicable laws. However, this allocation of share capital and financial rights can no longer be used for SELs of laboratory doctors acquired after May 30, 2013, due to the enactment of a law that requires that more than 50% of the share capital (in addition to 50% of the voting rights) of a SEL of laboratory doctors be held by Practicing Biologists (the ""Law of May 30, 2013""). The Law of May 30, 2013 provides an exemption for (i) SELs of laboratory doctors created before the date the law was promulgated (i.e., May 30, 2013) (ii) that operated under the previous share capital ownership structure on May 30, 2013, enabling them to continue having the majority of their share capital held by companies operating laboratories (referred to as the ""grandfathering exception""). Laboratory doctors practicing in the SELs benefiting from this exemption have a preemption right under this law in the event of a transfer of the shares issued by the SELs. For new SELs, we have therefore adopted a new ownership and corporate governance structure that allows us to own most of the financial rights of the SELs of laboratory doctors acquired since the law was promulgated, or that we may acquire in the future, although we may be required to adopt more complex legal structures than those used before the Law of May 30, 2013 came into force. We are not required to carry out any restructuring (because of the grandfathering exception set forth by the Law of May 30, 2013) and although the Law of May 30, 2013 is unlikely to prevent us from continuing our development and fully consolidating acquired SELs, if we were to alter aspects of our structure in response to regulatory changes or face a challenge to our current organizational and legal structure, we may no longer be able to fully consolidate our French activities in our financial statements, while our ability to centrally manage cash generated by French SELs or distribute dividends may be affected. Any new structure that we may have to implement to comply with the challenges or new requirements outlined above may result in us owning a smaller stake in existing SELs, and would make us more dependent on other contractual, corporate governance and other mechanisms. ----- As regards non-medical activities, we may have to reduce control over certain aspects of the governance of French SELs, depending on the evolution of French laws and regulations, case law, and the interpretation of these rules by competent authorities and courts. The Law of May 30, 2013 may also limit our ability to sell or transfer shares in SELs of laboratory doctors that we hold or may acquire in the future and render more complex any restructuring we might consider for our subsidiaries. The competent administrative authorities could interpret this regime as preventing some forms of restructuring, such as those involving a universal transfer of all assets where the acquired SEL is not covered by the grandfathering exception. Nevertheless, such restructurings are market practice, as confirmed by the French Competition Authority. In addition, professional biologists' trade unions may try to challenge our operations in France or our legal structure and organization. For example, the _Syndicat des Biologistes had introduced legal proceedings before the administrative court of Bordeaux that aimed at challenging an administrative decision by the competent administrative authorities (each, an ""ARS"") authorizing a merger operation involving an entity of the group. However, the claim was dismissed both in first instance and on appeal and is now definitely closed. Similarly, a professional union of biologists summoned in March 2022 the SEL Synlab Paris and the company Synlab France to appear before the Paris judicial court. This union seeks before the Paris judicial court the judicial winding-up of the SEL Synlab Paris on the ground that the shareholding of this SEL would be in breach of Article L. 6223-5. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the court proceedings are still ongoing. Furthermore, the Law no. 2015-990 of August 6, 2015 on growth and activity (the ""Macron Law"") intended notably to modify the limitations of capital ownership and corporate governance of SELs other than clinical laboratory SELs (i.e., SELs of technicians and lawyers). As regards clinical laboratory SELs, it added the paragraph 6° to sub-limb B of limb I of Article 5 of Law n°90-1258 of December 31, 1990, under which the shares of a SEL that are not held by laboratory doctors working within the SEL may be held, apart notably from professionals practicing the same profession, by a laboratory company established in another Member State of the European Union/EEA/Switzerland which operates, in one of these states an activity subject to a legal or regulatory status, or is required to hold a national or international recognized qualification, and ""complies, directly or indirectly through another intermediary legal entity, with the _requirements on holding of capital and voting rights provided by this Law"" (free translation) (i.e., Law of_ December 31, 1990). It cannot be excluded that this provision may be interpreted as requiring a corporate structure like the one developed by us, where the majority of the share capital and financial rights of the French SELs is held through laboratory companies incorporated in a European Union Member State other than France, to demonstrate that these laboratory companies comply with the restrictions provided by French Law regarding the allocation of the share capital and the voting rights, for the said structure to be valid. However, we are of the view that another interpretation should prevail, pursuant to which it could be considered that this new provision should not apply to the SELs covered by the grandfathering exception, as it is the case for us. More generally, any adjustment to French regulations applicable to our SELs in the future, any adverse interpretation of existing regulations and any introduction of new rules may affect or further limit our ability to own or control subsidiaries in France. In particular, the ARSs and the competent professional associations (Ordres professionnels) may challenge the legal structure and more specifically the corporate governance arrangements of the SELs that carry out our activities in France. Such challenge, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in 2003, the Ordre des pharmaciens initiated sanctions proceedings against certain of our subsidiary SELs, along with certain laboratory doctors practicing within these subsidiaries, for alleged violations of applicable regulations. These proceedings were dismissed in 2015, after a decision of the European Commission, confirmed by the European General Court on December 10, 2014, which found that the Ordre des pharmaciens had impeded competition on the clinical laboratory services market. We then claimed before the Paris administrative court a compensation for the loss suffered as a result of these practices and, in 2017, entered into a transaction protocol with the Ordre des Pharmaciens. Similarly, the Council of State issued on 10 July 2023 three rulings in the veterinary sector in relation to laws and regulations that are close to those applicable to SELs of biologists and physicians (the ""Conseil",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Although these decisions are not related to the human health sector, nor based on the",13.6.1,"The French regulatory environment in which we operate is particularly stringent, especially in relation to ownership and corporate structure of SELs (Société d'Exercice Liberal), particularly those operating clinical laboratories. If regulators were to successfully challenge our existing legal structure, this could have a material adverse impact on our activities.","French regulations impose stringent restrictions on the legal structure and ownership of French companies operating clinical laboratories. In particular, Article L. 6223-5 of the French Public Health Code (""Article L. 6223-5"") prohibits the following persons, on the basis of their activities or shareholdings (the ""prohibited investors""), from holding, whether directly or indirectly, a fraction of the share capital of a company operating a private French clinical laboratory (and not only SELs): (i) a natural or legal person practicing as a healthcare practitioner (other than as laboratory doctor), or operating as provider, distributor or manufacturer of medical devices or in vitro diagnostic medical devices, or operating as a private healthcare institution or as a social or medico-social institution governed by private law, or operating as an insurance or capitalization company or as a welfare, retirement or mandatory or elective social security institution; (ii) any natural or legal person holding 10% or more of the share capital of a company which provides, distributes or manufactures medical devices or in vitro diagnostic medical devices, or which operates as an insurance or capitalization company or as a welfare, retirement or mandatory or elective social security institution; and (iii) any natural or legal person holding, whether directly or indirectly, a fraction of the share capital of a company of healthcare practitioners which is authorized to take samples under the conditions mentioned under Article L. 6211-13 of the French Public Health Code and which does not meet the conditions of chapter II of title I of book II (""Clinical testing"") of part 6 of the legislative part of the French Public Health Code (i.e., articles L. 6212-1 to L. 6212-6 of the French Public Health Code on the qualification of a clinical laboratory). Based on legal advice we received in the context of previous financing transactions and prior to this Offering, our view is that ""indirect shareholding"" should be interpreted in light of the rules set out by Article L. 233-4 of the French Commercial Code (according to which any capital share, even less than 10% thereof, held by a controlled company is considered as indirectly held by the controlling company) and that, accordingly, the penalties provided for by the relevant texts can only apply to our SELs and the concerned prohibited investor if a prohibited investor takes control of us. In 2015, our representatives consulted the French Ministry of Social Affairs, Health and Women's Rights, which did not put forward any different interpretation of the related legal provisions. The Conseil d'Etat Rulings issued in July 2023 implies that the Council of State relied on this interpretation and confirmed this interpretation to assess and define the concept of ""indirect shareholding"" for the purpose of enforcing Article L. 241-17, II, 2°, of the French Rural and Maritime Fishing Code (which set out a list of prohibited shareholders for companies of veterinarians). As mentioned above, this precedent is not directly transposable to the medical biology sector, but we believe that this interpretation may be logically transposed to this sector for the purpose of interpreting Article L. 6223-5 as the principles at stake are similar. In the past, our compliance with the provisions of Article L. 6223-5 was considered in light of the fact that certain Cinven investment funds indirectly hold a minority stake in the French SELs. The Cinven ----- investment funds did not have legal capacity (absence de personnalité morale) and as such we concluded that the funds could not be considered as legally ""holding"" the portfolio participations at stake, nor did the Cinven investment funds or their limited partners exercise ownership rights over the share capital held in operating companies within their portfolio (which in addition may not be in France) that may engage in activities referred to in Article L. 6223-5. Compliance with the provisions of Article L. 6223-5 was also considered in light of transactions involving co-investors or potential co-investors of the Cinven investment funds that acquired, or contemplated the acquisition of, a stake in the share capital of SYNLAB. In the context of the Offering, our view remains that ""indirect shareholding"" as mentioned in Article L. 6223-5 must be interpreted in light of the rules set out by the French Commercial Code and that, accordingly, the penalties provided for by the relevant texts can only apply to our SELs and the concerned prohibited investor if a prohibited investor were to take control of SYNLAB. We do not believe that the Offering is prevented by the provisions of Article L. 6223-5 (and the same is true for the below-mentioned provisions of Article R. 4113-13 of the French Public Health Code) given that the issuance of Notes does not create any shareholding relationship between the holders of the Notes and the Target or the SELs. If it were argued that the Offering has facilitated the Cinven Funds' majority ownership of the share capital of the Target and, as a result, control over the Target, we cannot guarantee that the completion of the Offering or the Acquisition would not create any regulatory risks in light of the above-mentioned provisions of Article L. 6223-5 (and the same is true for the below-mentioned provisions of Article R. 4113-13 of the French Public Health Code). If our above-mentioned interpretation of the provisions of Article L. 6223-5 is not correct, our French laboratories and any investor, natural or legal person, that qualifies as a prohibited investor, acquiring a stake in our share capital could face a fine of up to €2 million if it is a legal entity and €500,000 if it is a natural person. It is unclear whether such fine could be imposed for each of our SELs. This could also give rise to disciplinary sanctions and administrative measures (e.g., delisting - _radiation) by the competent professional associations against our SELs and the medical biologists as well as to civil remedies. In addition, Article R. 4113-13 of the French Public Health Code (""Article R. 4113-13"") prohibits various categories of persons from holding, whether directly or indirectly, shares representing part or all of the share capital of SELs of doctors on the basis of their activities. This provision would be applicable to our SELs of anatomopathology doctors. We believe that ""indirect shareholding"" within the meaning of Article R. 4113-13 is to be interpreted in the same way as for Article L. 6223-5. If our interpretation were challenged, this could give rise to disciplinary sanctions and administrative measures (e.g., delisting) by the physicians order (""Ordre des Médecins"") against our SELs of pathology doctors as well as to civil remedies. Any challenge to our analysis of either Article L. 6223-5 or Article R. 4113-13, which remain subject to interpretation, or any change in these legal provisions or their application by the relevant authorities, could have a material adverse impact on our activities in France, operating income, financial condition and outlook, as well as on prohibited investors, which may also be subject to personal sanctions. As a result, any of the aforementioned events may cause material disruption to our activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Finally, on a prospective note, the Law of December 31, 1990 that regulates SELs in general will be replaced as of September 1, 2024 by the Ordinance No. 2023-77 of February 8, 2023, on the corporate practice of regulated liberal professions (the ""Ordinance of February 8, 2023""). As per Ordinance of February 8, 2023, the companies that are subject to Law of December 31, 1990 are granted one additional year from the entry into force of the Ordinance of February 8, 2023 (i.e., until September 1, 2025) to comply with the majority of the requirements of Ordinance of February 8, 2023. The Ordinance of February 8, 2023 does not significantly affect the substance of the statutory provisions applicable to SELs. However, the French Parliament could decide to modify the Ordinance and the French Government needs to adopt decrees in application of this Ordinance. The content of these decrees could affect the regulatory provisions applicable to SELs.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Because of the breadth of these laws, it is possible that some of our business arrangements could come under scrutiny by governmental authorities or third parties in the jurisdictions where we do business. As part of our compliance management system, we conduct reviews of our business arrangements with customers for compliance with applicable laws. In the course of one of these reviews, we have identified certain past business arrangements, which we believe were then common practice in the respective market, but which might nevertheless be challenged by the competent governmental authorities or third parties. We have replaced or terminated all such business arrangements. We do not believe that such business arrangements represented a material portion of our consolidated revenue and believe other operators in the market have or had implemented similar arrangements. Notwithstanding such measures, we cannot rule out the possibility that governmental authorities or third parties in jurisdictions where we do business may challenge any of our past, current or future business arrangements, which could result in administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines. In addition to the financial impact, we could suffer significant damage to our reputation if found to be in violation of applicable laws. In addition, as part of our compliance management system, we provide what we believe to be appropriate training to our employees on acceptable business practices. However, this training could fail to adequately educate sales personnel on acceptable business practices and it could also fail to detect the actions of sales personnel who act in violation of applicable laws.

Moreover, in light of continuously evolving legal and regulatory requirements, and internal developments such as corporate reorganizations, there can be no certainty that our risk management systems, internal controls and compliance systems and related governance structures will adequately identify and address all relevant requirements. Historically, we have grown through acquisitions, and, as a consequence, newly acquired laboratories often use older software platforms that are not consistent with our systems.

Despite holding a majority of the voting rights upon settlement of the Acquisition Offer and being able to acquire additional shares of the Target, the Bidder will not control the Target and its ability to influence the Management Board of the Target will be limited until the Control Date. Prior to the Control Date, the Issuer has therefore no right to issue binding instructions to the Management Board of the Target, which is required to manage the business of the Target Group under its own responsibility and in a manner that is in the best interest of the Target Group. Consequently, prior to the Control Date, the Management Board of the Target may elect not to (i) agree to any integration or restructuring initiatives proposed by the Issuer or (ii) operate the business of the Target Group in the same way that the Issuer would, which may delay or jeopardize the realization of the expected benefits of the Acquisition or the Group's ability to achieve the strategic objectives and financial and operational targets for the Acquisition.

If this occurs, you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in an investment that yields comparable returns. In addition, the escrowed funds will initially only be in the amount of the gross proceeds received from the offering of the Notes, and will not be sufficient to pay the special mandatory redemption amount, which will include accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the special mandatory redemption date.

Furthermore, the Group may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indenture contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial and the proceeds from such indebtedness may be used, among other things, to finance shareholder dividends reducing the Group's liquidity while increasing its leverage.

These agreements limit the Group's ability to, among other things: - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock; - make certain restricted payments and investments; - transfer or sell assets; - enter into transactions with affiliates; - create or incur certain liens; - make certain loans, investments or acquisitions; - issue or sell share capital of certain of the Group's subsidiaries; - create or incur restrictions on the ability of the Group's subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to the Group; - take certain actions that would impair the security interests in the Collateral; - merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the Group's assets; and - pay or redeem subordinated debt or repurchase equity. All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See ""Description of the _Notes—Certain Covenants."" The covenants to which the Group is subject could limit its ability to operate_ the Group's business, to finance future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in the Group's interest. In addition, the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement requires the Group to comply with certain affirmative covenants while it remains outstanding. Any future Indebtedness may include similar or other restrictive terms. A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions under the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement could, ----- subject to the applicable cure period, result in an event of default under the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default that is continuing under the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement, the relevant creditors are entitled to cancel the availability of their commitments and/or elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable.

The pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over a securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) of French companies may be enforced at the option of the secured creditor either by a sale of the pledged shares in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors), by judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or by contractual foreclosure (attribution conventionnelle or pacte commissoire) of the shares to the secured creditor, following which the secured creditor becomes the legal owner of the pledged shares. In a proceeding for _attribution judiciaire or attribution conventionnelle, an expert is appointed (whether contractually or by the court) to value the Collateral (in this case, the pledged shares) and if the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt under the pledge, the secured creditor is required to pay the relevant pledgor a soulte equal to the difference between the value of the shares and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent sale of the Collateral. Also, if the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether an attribution judiciaire or _an attribution conventionnelle), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the_ foreclosed securities. Consequently, in the event the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the New Term Loan B and the holders of the Notes or as creditor of the parallel debt) decides to, and is entitled to, enforce the share pledges through a judicial or contractual foreclosure and if the value of such shares exceeds the amount of the secured debt under the pledge, the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the New Term Loan B and the holders of the Notes or as creditor of the parallel debt) may be required to pay to the relevant pledgor a soulte equal to the value by which such shares exceeds the amount of secured debt under the pledge. If the value of such shares is less than the amount of the secured debt under the pledge, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditor will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such shares, and the remaining amount owed to such creditor will be unsecured. If the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the New Term Loan B and the holders of the Notes or as creditor of the parallel debt) declines to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the shares, a sale of the pledged shares could be undertaken by public auction in accordance with applicable law. Due to the French regulatory restrictions set forth in the immediately following risk factor, the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the New Term Loan B and the holders of the Notes or as creditor of the parallel debt) is likely to have an incentive to enforce the pledged shares through a public auction. Since public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a going concern (as the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies) it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect our value as a going concern.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

See ""Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security _Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.""_ Due to the laws and jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security in certain jurisdictions (including, but not limited to France and Germany) the security interests that constitutes security for the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees will be granted in favor of the Security Agent as beneficiary of parallel debt obligations (""Parallel Debt"") created to satisfy a requirement that the Security Agent, as grantee of certain types of collateral, be a creditor of the relevant Guarantor. The Parallel Debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes (the ""Principal Obligations"") but in certain jurisdictions, these Parallel Debt provisions would not be applicable provided that the relevant case law has not ruled for its application. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. The Security Agent will have, pursuant to the Parallel Debt, a claim against the Issuer for the full principal amount of the Notes. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to enforce such security except through the Security Agent. Holders of the Notes bear some risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. The Parallel Debt obligations referred to above are contained in the Intercreditor Agreement or in a debtor accession deed applicable to a given Debtor, which is governed by English law. There can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective before German courts since there is no judicial or other guidance as to its efficacy, and therefore the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted as the Collateral may be invalid or unenforceable with respect to the claims of any person who is not a party to the relevant security document, including all holders of the Notes. In France, although the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recognized, in a decision on Parallel Debt mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011, n°10-25.533 Belvédère) relating to bond documentation governed by New York law, the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a collateral agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a collateral agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the collateral agent as Parallel Debt Creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the collateral agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of ""parallel debt"" obligations in favor of the Security Agent. Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the parallel debt structure are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interest in the Collateral. Further, under a parallel debt structure, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the parallel debt. The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important following Defaults or Events of Default, and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the Notes.

Enforcement of the obligations under a Guarantee against any such Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, related third-party transactions, corporate benefit, capital maintenance and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally and may have the effect that the amounts collectable under such Guarantee are reduced to zero. In addition, each of the Note Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Note Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor's or security provider's corporate interests, or the burden of such Note Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Note Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. In particular, enforcement of any such Note Guarantee or Collateral against the relevant Guarantor or security provider would be subject to certain contractual limitations (so called ""limitation language"") contained in the respective Indenture (or any other document governing the Note Guarantees) and Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantor or security provider. As a result, a Guarantor's or security provider's liability under its Guarantee or Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Note Guarantee or Collateral cannot be enforced at all. For example, the granting of guarantees and/or security interests by German Guarantors or German security providers will be subject to (i) certain German capital maintenance rules of the German Act regarding Companies with Limited Liability (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung) if that Guarantor or security provider is incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) or a German limited partnership with a German limited liability company as general partner and (ii) certain capital maintenance and financial assistance rules set out in the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) in relation to German stock corporations (Aktiengesellschaften) as the Target and its subsidiaries. Guarantees and/or security interests provided by an AG, GmbH and/or its direct or indirect subsidiaries in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of any direct or indirect parent or affiliate company are, unless a specific exception applies, considered ----- disbursements violating German capital maintenance law. Furthermore, the granting of guarantees by an AG or its direct or indirect subsidiaries which serve the purpose of supporting the financing of the acquisition of shares in such AG (financial assistance) is prohibited and, therefore, invalid. According to the wording of the law, both the prohibition of financial assistance as well as the capital maintenance requirements described above (for German Guarantors incorporated as GmbH and AG) are not applicable while a DPLTA exists between the relevant AG or GmbH-Guarantor and the shareholder on whose instructions the relevant guarantee is granted. However, the Indenture will not contain any covenant requiring the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries to take any efforts to implement or maintain a DPLTA. Furthermore, even in case a DPLTA is in place and provided that certain other requirements are met, the granting of guarantees by a GmbH, AG and/or its direct or indirect subsidiaries may be considered to be in violation of the capital maintenance rules and financial assistance restrictions, in which case such guarantees and security interests can be void, unenforceable, restricted and/or subject to a redemption claim against the beneficiary. In particular, under a view in German literature, the DPLTA exemption only applies if payments under the guarantee do not cause the dominated entity (i.e., the relevant AG or GmbH Guarantor) to incur a balance sheet loss for which it cannot reasonably expect to be compensated for by the dominating entity due to the financial condition of the dominating entity. Therefore, any Guarantees provided by an AG or GmbH, including the Guarantors and any of their direct and indirect subsidiaries will be subject to certain contractual limitations (so called ""limitation language"") contained in the Indenture (or any other document governing the Note Guarantees or Collateral) designed to ensure compliance with applicable financial assistance, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or any other general statutory laws. With respect to the DPLTA exemption, such contractual enforcement limitations will apply notwithstanding the existence of a DPLTA if and to the extent despite the existence of a DPLTA there would be a violation of the relevant capital maintenance and/or financial assistance rules in case of an enforcement of the relevant guarantee obligations. If the Target will be converted into a German limited liability company (GmbH) or otherwise ceases to be an AG (as further described in the definition of ""Control Date"") only the limitations for GmbH will apply. See ""Limitations on Validity and Enforceability _of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Germany— Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.""_ The granting and enforcement of the Note Guarantee by the Guarantor in Austria is subject to, and may be limited by, strict Austrian capital maintenance rules under Austrian corporate law. Under these rules, guarantees given by an Austrian limited liability company or stock corporation for liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are deemed to be disbursements in breach of Austrian capital maintenance rules and are therefore invalid and unenforceable if the granting of such guarantees by the Austrian company is not in its best interests and not fully justified by a business purpose (i.e., not for its corporate benefit (betrieblich gerechtfertigt)). The Austrian Guarantor's Note Guarantee will therefore be subject to ""limitation language"" which will provide, among other things, that any obligations and/or liabilities under its Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount permitted under the Austrian capital maintenance rules (which amount may be zero or close to zero). Accordingly, (i) the Note Guarantee of the Guarantor in Austria will effectively have no monetary value, unless the Note Guarantee is in the best interest of the Austrian Guarantor and fully justified by a business purpose (betriebliche Rechtfertigung) and (ii) amounts recoverable under the Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the Guarantor under the applicable law. Although common practice, the limitation language has not been tested by Austrian courts. See ""Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note _Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Austria—Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantee.""_ Furthermore, to reduce the risk of triggering Austrian stamp duty with respect to the Austrian Guarantor's Note Guarantee, the obligations guaranteed by the Austrian Guarantor's Note Guarantee will be limited to guaranteeing/securing claims that are considered credit-claims (including interest and possibly typical ancillary charges) of a lender or creditor against a borrower under a loan or credit agreement (which, for the purposes of the Austrian Stamp Duty Act, includes such claims against an issuer under a bond issue). See ""Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and _Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Austria—Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantee—Stamp Duty.""_ Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing, or providing security in relation to, indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition. Under French corporate benefit rules, a court could declare any guarantee or security unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, or any proceeds have been obtained from the enforcement of any security, require that the recipient return the payment or any ----- proceeds so obtained to the relevant guarantor or security provider, if the court found that the French guarantor or security provider did not receive some real and adequate corporate benefit from the transaction involving the grant of the guarantee or security as a whole. Existence of corporate benefit is a factual matter which must be determined on a case-by-case basis. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor or security provider and whether the amounts guaranteed or secured are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. Furthermore, your ability to enforce the pledges over certain security may be limited by French law restrictions on the ownership of laboratory companies and future regulatory changes may have an impact on the value of the Collateral. French law provides restrictions on the ownership of the capital of laboratory companies, including in some cases on indirect ownership. In particular, Article L. 6223‑5 of the French Public Health Code forbids various categories of persons from making any direct or indirect investment in the share capital of a company operating a French clinical laboratory, on the basis of their activities or relations with certain activities in the medical, life insurance or paramedical sectors to name a few (the ""prohibited investors"") (see ""Regulation—France""). As a result, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce a pledge on the share capital of certain of our subsidiaries that indirectly own French laboratory companies is limited by such French law restrictions. For instance, the shares may not be acquired by an entity falling within the category of ""prohibited investors"" if this acquisition leads to a breach of Article L. 6223-5 of the French Public Health Code. Under Italian financial assistance rules (set out in Article 2358 of the Italian civil code for companies incorporated as a società per azioni and Article 2474 of the Italian civil code for companies incorporated as società a responsabilità limitata), an Italian company is prevented from providing, directly or indirectly, financial assistance (whether giving security or a guarantee, granting loans or providing credit support in other forms) for the acquisition and/or refinancing of acquisition of (or subscription to) its own shares or shares of any its direct or indirect parent companies. Under Italian financial assistance rules, any guarantee or security provided in breach of the financial assistance prohibitions would be unenforceable. In the event the acquisition funds cannot be clearly identified and separated from other funds, an Italian court could consider the relevant guarantee or security provided by an Italian company unenforceable even if such guarantee or security includes general carveouts intending to exclude from the scope of the guarantee or security any financial support which may be considered to be in breach of Italian financial assistance prohibitions. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the relevant Italian company. It is possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor's Guarantee or the security provider's Collateral on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Guarantee or Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Guarantees or Collateral apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future Guarantees and Collateral may be subject to similar limitations. An increase in the amount of debt that benefits from such Note Guarantee without a corresponding increase in the amount of the Guarantee will dilute the value of such Note Guarantee to its beneficiaries, including the holders of the Notes.

The insolvency laws of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to you as the laws of other jurisdictions. Pursuant to the Regulation (EU) no. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (the ""EU Insolvency Regulation"") entered into force on June 26, 2017, which applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), the court which shall have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State where the company has its ""centre of main interests."" According to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, this is ""the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties."" The determination of where any such company has its ""centre of main interests"" is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. The term ""centre of main interests"" is not a static concept and may change from time to time. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a company has its ""centre of main interests"" in the Member State in which it has its registered office, this presumption only applies, if the registered office has not been moved to another EU member state within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Since the Issuer is organized under the laws of Luxembourg and has its registered office in Luxembourg a court is therefore likely to hold that the ""centre of main interests"" of the Issuer is in Luxembourg. Consequently, and provided _that this presumption will not be rebutted and the ""centre of main interests"" will not be shifted to another_ jurisdiction by the Issuer, any insolvency proceedings with regard to the Issuer are likely to be initiated in Luxembourg and would most likely be governed by the insolvency laws of Luxembourg. The provisions of Luxembourg insolvency law may differ substantially from the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including with respect to preferred satisfaction of secured creditors from enforcement proceedings, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may be less favorable to you than comparable provisions of other jurisdictions. The Issuer may shift its ""centre of main interests"" again, and thereby the applicable restructuring or insolvency laws, to another jurisdiction, which could offer less favorable terms to you than the laws of Luxembourg. In addition, even without such intentional shift of the ""centre of main interests"" by the Issuer, it cannot be ruled out that a court or other competent authority of such other jurisdiction, will deem the restructuring or insolvency laws of such ----- jurisdiction to be applicable and opens restructuring or insolvency proceedings under the laws of such jurisdiction with or without the consent of the Issuer.

Further, the debt of the Target under the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B bears interest at a floating rate and is expected to remain in place following the Acquisition if the Squeeze-Out Threshold is met on or before the Completion Date.

Although the Group may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurances that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms.

Although we currently have hedging arrangements in place for a portion of our floating rate indebtedness and may in the future enter into and maintain certain other hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms.

In addition, entities in the Target Group will not be able to provide guarantees or security with respect to the Notes until the Control Date has occurred. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Acquisition—The Issuer does not control the _Management Board and will not control the daily business of the Target Group until the Control Date and there can be no assurance that the Control Date will occur.""_",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.11,THE TRANSACTIONS The Acquisition,13.11.5,Structural Measures,"Following the consummation of the Share Push-Down, Ephios Bidco may, subject to economic and regulatory circumstances, which may include the development of the stock exchange trading price of the Target shares and the number of shares that it has secured, consider implementing one or more structural measures. _Delisting_ Ephios Bidco may consider, in cooperation with the Management Board, announcing and implementing a delisting procedure pursuant to Section 39 of the German Stock Exchange Act (Börsengesetz) and the withdrawal of the admission for trading of the Target's shares from the open market segments of the relevant stock exchanges. In case of such a delisting, a delisting acquisition offer will be made to all remaining Target shareholders to acquire their shares in exchange for the granting of adequate cash compensation, which could be equal in value to the Acquisition Offer price, but could also be lower or higher. It is anticipated that a delisting acquisition offer, if implemented, would take approximately two to three months to complete. A delisting acquisition offer, if it results in Ephios Bidco holding shares above the SqueezeOut Threshold (as defined below), may be followed by a squeeze-out procedure, as discussed below, at the discretion of Ephios Bidco. _Corporate Squeeze-Out_ If Ephios Bidco holds at least 95% of the share capital of the Target in the future, it will be entitled to implement a squeeze-out procedure under German stock corporation law procedure pursuant to Section 327a et seqq. of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz). In such case, the remaining shareholders of the Target will be required to transfer their shares to Ephios Bidco in exchange for adequate ----- cash compensation. The appropriateness of the amount of such cash compensation can be challenged in appraisal proceedings. _Merger Squeeze-Out_ If Ephios Bidco holds at least 90% (the ""Squeeze-Out Threshold"") of the share capital of the Target and if Ephios Bidco converts its legal form into the legal form of a German stock corporation (or if another subsidiary of the Bidder has the legal form of a German stock corporation) (a ""Bidco Conversion"") and has become the shareholder of at least 90% of the share capital of the Target, it will have the right to implement a squeeze-out pursuant to Section 62 paragraph 5 of the German Transformation Act (Umwandlungsgesetz) by merging the Target into Ephios Bidco (or such subsidiary, as the case may be). Such squeeze-out would also have the effect that all remaining Target shareholders will be required to transfer their shares in exchange for adequate cash compensation and the appropriateness of the amount of such cash compensation can be challenged in appraisal proceedings. A Bidco Conversion would further limit the credit support that can be provided by Ephios Bidco (or such other German stock corporation subsidiary of the Bidder) and, as such, after the merger of the Target into Ephios Bidco (or such other German stock corporation subsidiary of the Bidder) becoming effective, would also limit the credit support being provided by the Target Group. In the case of a Bidco Conversion and a subsequent merger squeeze out (as described above), following the occurrence of the Control Date, the credit support provided by Ephios Bidco and its subsidiaries (including the Target Group) would be restricted as detailed for German AGs under ""Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note _Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Germany."" This_ limitation could be mitigated by the converted Ephios Bidco (or such other German stock corporation subsidiary of the Bidder) entering into a DPLTA with its direct shareholder; however, there is no obligation in the Indenture for the Issuer to enter into a DPLTA or to otherwise ensure that the Control Date will occur or that credit support is facilitated. The consummation of any squeeze-out proceeding described above would automatically result in the delisting of the Target's shares from the stock exchange if a delisting has not been implemented earlier by way of termination the admission for trading from the stock exchange as described above. _DPLTA_ A DPLTA is not required for the Bidder and/or Ephios Bidco to finance the Acquisition Offer or to realize its economic and strategic objectives.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Concurrently with the Offering, the Issuer is syndicating the New Term Loan B. On the pricing date for the Notes, the Issuer expects to allocate an aggregate amount of up to €1,450.0 million of senior debt consisting of the Notes and the New Term Loan B. The final allocation between the Notes and the Term Loan B is subject to final determination on the pricing date for the Notes based on market conditions. (3) On September 21, 2023, the Bidder entered into an interim ""payment-in-kind"" (PIK) facility with certain lenders in an aggregate amount of up to €500.0 million. On or prior to the Completion Date, Ephios Subco 1 is expected to enter into an equivalent longterm PIK Notes purchase agreement providing for a PIK facility in an aggregate amount of up to €500.0 million and the commitments under the interim PIK facility will be cancelled.

(4) Represents cash on the Target's statement of financial position available for purposes of the Transactions, namely the repayment of the Existing Term Loan A. In the event that the number of shares of the Target held by the Bidder does not meet the SqueezeOut Threshold, it is anticipated that an amount greater than the €40.0 million of cash on the Target's statement of financial position indicated in the table above may be used in connection with the Transactions. In such scenario, the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B is expected to be repaid in part or in full using cash on the Target's balance sheet, proceeds of the Offering and/or borrowings under the New Term Loan B that are not required to be utilized for purposes of acquiring shares of the Target. The higher amount of the Target's cash that would be utilized in the Transactions if the Squeeze-Out Threshold is not met is therefore a consequence of the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B being repaid in part or in full in such scenario and additional funds from the proceeds of the Offering and/or borrowings under the New Term Loan B being required to purchase shares of the Target or for such debt repayment. For example, if the Bidder acquires the 41.9% of the share capital of the Target that it does not currently own, but has been tendered in the Acquisition Offer or is subject to co-investment agreements or irrevocable undertakings as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, and as a result will own 84.7% of the share capital of the Target following the Acquisitions, it is anticipated that the €385.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B would be repaid in full and a total of €84.0 million of cash on the Target's balance sheet would be used in connection with the Transactions. If the Bidder's ownership is above 84.7% of the share capital of the Target, but remains below the Squeeze-Out Threshold, the amount of cash used in the Transactions and the amount of the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B repayment will vary. (5) As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Bidder has secured 188,112,767 shares, representing 84.7% of the share capital and 85.6% of the voting rights of the Target, including 95,096,393 shares, or 42.8% of the share capital of the Target, held directly by the Bidder or persons acting jointly with the Bidder (within the meaning of Section 2 paragraph 5 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und Übernahmegesetz)), and 93,016,374 shares, or 41.9% of the share capital of the Target, that have been tendered in the Acquisition Offer or are subject to co-investment agreements or irrevocable undertakings. See ""The Transactions—The Acquisition—The Acquisition Offer."" In the event that the number of shares of the Target held by the Bidder does not meet the Squeeze-Out Threshold, it is anticipated that an amount less than the €1,287.0 million of funds indicated in the table above will be used to acquire Target shares. The lower amount that would be utilized in the Transactions if the Squeeze-Out Threshold is not met is a consequence of fewer shares being purchased in such scenario. For example, if the Bidder acquires the 41.9% of the share capital of the Target that it does not ----- currently own, but has been tendered in the Acquisition Offer or is subject to co-investment agreements or irrevocable undertakings as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, and as a result will own 84.7% of the share capital of the Target following the Acquisitions, it is anticipated that €946.0 million will be used to acquire Target shares. In such scenario, the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B is expected to be repaid in full. If the Bidder's ownership is above 84.7% of the share capital of the Target, but remains below the Squeeze-Out Threshold, the amount used to acquire Target shares and the amount of the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B repayment will vary. (6) Represents the aggregate amount of indebtedness of the Target Group under the 2021 Term Loan Facility that is outstanding as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and is expected to remain outstanding until being repaid in connection with the Transactions.

The Target Group prepaid €200.0 million of the loan in October and November 2023 using the proceeds of certain asset sales, including the sale of its veterinary diagnostics business in Belgium, Germany and Spain.

The proceeds of such PIK Notes will be advanced as shareholder loans by Ephios Subco 1 through Ephios Subco 2, the Issuer and Ephios Bidco to the Bidder. On or prior to the Completion Date, the Bidder will transfer shares of €500.0 million in the Target in full payment of the corresponding shareholder loan.

The ""as adjusted"" column represents the equity value of the Issuer on a pro forma basis for the Transactions, assuming that the Bidder will acquire 100% of the Target shares in the Transactions. In the event that the number of Target shares held by the Bidder does not meet the SqueezeOut Threshold, it is anticipated that the ""as adjusted"" total equity value of the Issuer will vary with the difference representing the funds required to purchase Target shares. For example, if the Bidder acquires the 41.9% of the share capital of the Target that it does not currently own, but has been tendered in the Acquisition Offer or is subject to co-investment agreements or irrevocable undertakings as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, and as a result will own 84.7% of the share capital of the Target following the Acquisitions, it is anticipated that total equity will be €1,277.0 million, with the €341.0 million difference representing additional funds that would not be utilized to purchase Target shares in such scenario. If the Bidder's ownership is above 84.7% of the share capital of the Target, but remains below the Squeeze-Out Threshold, the amount of total equity will vary. (12) Total capitalization is calculated as the sum of total financial debt and total shareholders' equity. In the event that the number of Target shares held by the Bidder does not meet the Squeeze-Out Threshold, total capitalization is expected to be lower than the €3,810.0 million indicated in the table above for the reasons noted above, including the lower amount of debt resulting from the partial or full repayment of the Existing SYNLAB Term Loan B discussed in footnote (5) above and the higher total equity discussed in footnote (11) above.

504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,2375,MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,2375.1,Overview,2375.1.1,,"We are the leader in medical diagnostic services and specialty testing in Europe. We offer a full range of innovative and reliable medical diagnostics to patients, practicing doctors, hospitals and clinics, governments and corporates. Providing the leading level of service within the industry, we are the partner of choice for routine and specialty diagnostics in human medicine. We continuously innovate medical diagnostic services for the benefit of patients and customers. We are present in 33 countries across five continents and hold leading positions in most markets, regularly reinforcing the strength of our network through a proven acquisition and portfolio optimization strategy, while remaining focused on diligent cost control through initiatives such as our ""SALIX"" (Scale, Alignment, Leverage, Instruction, X-check) operational excellence program. More than 27,000 employees, including over 2,000 medical experts, contribute every day to our worldwide success as we perform around 600 million laboratory tests per year. Our business is well-positioned to take advantage of the growing market for clinical laboratory and medical diagnostic services in Europe, which benefits from favorable structural trends, including an aging population, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, a growing focus on disease prevention, increasing outsourcing of clinical laboratory testing by hospitals and an additional need for advanced testing. We have been a pioneer in the consolidation trend in the European clinical laboratories market. Our expansion strategy is focused on adapting to local market environments while drawing from the strength of our pan-European support functions. Our market position and the scale of our laboratory network also allow us to benefit from favorable procurement conditions with suppliers, including through group-wide panEuropean framework supply agreements for reagents and equipment. Major parts of the European clinical laboratory and medical diagnostic services market remain fragmented, providing further meaningful opportunities for continued expansion. Our SALIX program consists of efficiency-enhancing and cost-savings initiatives relating to laboratory centralization; group-wide logistics management; and the optimization of staffing of laboratories and blood collection points. The SALIX program addresses all three of our primary cost groups (i.e., materials, personnel and other operating expenses). Having been implemented in 2017, with the first savings achieved in 2018, SALIX has generated approximately €140 million in total savings, including approximately €25 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 and approximately €30 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with further ongoing savings expected over the medium term. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded revenue of €2,691.1 million, with net profit (group share) amounting to €130.0 million. Our _Pro Forma Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA was €455.6 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, amounting to 17.6% of our revenue for the period.

Testing volumes have also increased as the medical profession has shifted its focus over time from the treatment of chronic and severe illnesses to the prevention and early detection and diagnosis of such illnesses. This shift has been supported by growing demand for customized healthcare solutions and the potential for preventive medicine to reduce medication and hospitalization costs. In doing so, physicians are also increasingly relying on clinical testing for more accurate diagnoses. Other factors, such as the development of new technologies and tests, combined with the reduction in costs from increased automation of testing, have increased the role of clinical testing. In addition, outsourcing of specialty tests from hospital laboratories has also increased in many countries where we operate, due mainly to budgetary pressures and public spending cuts. The overall greater health consciousness of the general public along with increased disposable income contribute to both volume growth and a willingness of certain patients to absorb out-of-pocket costs.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,2375,MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,2375.2,Principal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,2375.2.2,Tariffs and Reimbursement Levels for Clinical Laboratory Testing,"In many of the countries where we operate, clinical laboratory testing services are delivered to patients under government healthcare programs that are at least partly funded by public organizations that directly set prices or provide a mandated method for determining prices covering all or some of the clinical laboratory testing services that we offer. Prices may be changed at any time, and, while some prices have risen in certain countries in recent years, the more common trend has been for price revisions to result in price reductions to counterbalance growth in test volumes. We do not expect widespread price increases for clinical laboratory services in the short or medium term as governments seek to control healthcare expenditure. In addition to cutting prices or reimbursement levels, governments have also sought to reduce the number of tests prescribed by doctors and limit the testing services covered by their health and social security programs. Price pressures on underlying activities were lifted in certain regions and countries due to the increased budgets for diagnostics and prevention or due to the impact of the lockdowns on actual government budget consumption for routine testing. The transfer of public service to private providers (outsourcing) increased in certain markets, broadening the addressable market for private providers. In other markets where we operate, healthcare patients rely on private insurance to pay medical bills, but the pricing of medical services is regulated by the state. In such markets, tariffs are set by governments and healthcare authorities and are the basis for the prices we charge to our clients. The timing of tariff cuts and other measures related to the control of healthcare expenditure may affect the comparability of our financial results and the scope of the impact on a particular period or in a particular country. For the year ended December 31, 2022, nearly all of our revenue from human medicine in our core market countries of France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom was generated from services for which prices are directly or indirectly regulated by governmental authorities. The average reimbursement levels for laboratory tests vary significantly from one country to another. In certain markets or segments of our markets, such as in Spain, prices may be freely negotiated. For our B2B business, pricing for services provided at the request of prescribers and physicians is more commonly regulated, while pricing for hospital laboratory outsourcing and laboratory-to-laboratory services is usually more flexible. Our B2C business is also partially subject to regulated pricing, while our D2C services generally can be flexibly priced. Accordingly, our B2B business, which includes business with hospitals, typically has lower margins than either B2C or D2C, both of which allow us to have a direct relationship with the patient and capture a higher proportion of the value. We must also contend with efforts by non-governmental third-party payers (mainly private health insurers) to control the utilization and reimbursement of clinical laboratory testing services. In certain markets, we receive payment for our services from private health insurers that have gained significant bargaining power by reimbursing healthcare services only if such services are provided by pre-selected providers. These private health insurers negotiate fee structures with healthcare providers, including clinical laboratories, ----- and certain private health insurers have insisted on discounted fee structures as a condition for pre-selection in the past and may insist on further discounted fee structures in the future. We are also exposed to the impact of general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate on tariffs and reimbursement levels for clinical laboratory testing. Lower government, third-party payer and patient healthcare expenditure would generally be expected to have a negative impact on our results of operations, but difficult economic conditions can alternatively have a positive impact on the outsourcing of clinical laboratory testing insofar as the roll-out of cost-cutting or deficit reduction plans may prompt companies or public-sector institutions to outsource clinical testing services more rapidly and to a greater extent. Price cuts may, for example, be offset by volume growth owing to an increase in the number of patients relying on private healthcare plans. We believe that there is a trend that reflects the erosion of trust in the public health insurance system and a poorer quality of service provided by some public healthcare systems amid fiscal austerity. We benefit from a broad customer base and a diversity of payers for our testing services.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,2375,MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,2375.2,Principal Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,2375.2.3,Influence of the Legislative and Regulatory Environment in which We Operate,"We are subject to significant regulation and control by various regulatory organizations and must adapt to frequent legislative and regulatory changes at both national and European levels. These regulations mainly pertain to operating standards, professional qualifications of laboratory personnel, ownership and corporate governance constraints on companies operating clinical laboratories, and pricing and reimbursement levels of clinical laboratory tests. Changes made to laws and regulations in the past have had, and in the future may continue to have, a significant impact on our results of operations. In particular, compliance by laboratories with operating standards and the professional qualifications of laboratory personnel may increase our payroll and related expenses and our administrative, legal and operating costs. For example, as detailed in ""Risk Factors,"" the Law of May 30, 2013 amended the ownership rules concerning clinical testing laboratory companies in France, significantly impacting our operations. The Law of May 30, 2013 may limit our ability to sell or transfer shares in SELs that we hold or that we may acquire in the future and render more complex any restructuring we might consider for our subsidiaries. The Law of May 30, 2013 extended the French regional health authorities' oversight of compliance with the concentration rules in a given geographical region (zone, previously referred to as territoire de santé) and clarified the fact that the acquisition of shares of companies operating a clinical laboratory is not authorized when such an acquisition would enable a person or entity to control, directly or indirectly, more than 33% of all clinical tests performed in the same zone. A person or entity is deemed to control more than 33% of all clinical tests carried out in a zone if they own, directly or indirectly, the majority of the share capital of several companies operating a clinical laboratory, and the combined business of those companies represents more than 33% of all clinical tests in that zone. See ""Risk Factors—Current or future regulatory _changes in France, and challenges brought by the competent administrative authorities, professional associations or professional biologists' trade unions, may affect our flexibility, make us more dependent on laboratory doctors to check operations carried out by our French laboratories, and call into question our organizational and legal structure.""_ In addition, since the clinical sector is VAT exempt for payers, clinical testing laboratories are responsible for paying VAT, thereby recognizing operating costs inclusive of VAT. VAT rates, the amount of taxes on sales and other similar taxes may be increased, especially in the current economic and political climate, with certain European governments seeking to raise more revenue from direct and indirect taxation. In addition, deferred tax assets have been recognized to reflect the differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax base as well as carried forward tax losses from our subsidiaries. Future recovery of these assets will depend on tax rules, the outcome of the possible tax audits and future results of the relevant subsidiaries.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

We believe that consolidation of the European clinical laboratory testing market will allow large international laboratory consolidators like us, which benefit from high testing volumes across geographic markets, to further expand regional laboratory clusters, improve efficiency and lower overall cost, and thus mitigate the effect of potential future price declines and create significant value for our shareholders. ----- We have a proven track record as an effective consolidator of small- and medium-sized, locally owned private laboratories and intend to continue to acquire laboratories to expand our footprint in existing markets, reinforce our scientific expertise and expand into new markets. We have primarily focused on acquisitions of small- and medium-sized regional laboratories in order to maintain a balance across regions and strengthen our network in certain countries and enter into new markets that present high growth opportunities. From the formation of the SYNLAB Group in the second half of 2015 through September 30, 2023, we completed 159 acquisitions of laboratories (excluding additional acquisitions in business units that were sold during that period). The acquired laboratory businesses had a combined enterprise value of approximately €1.1 billion or an average of approximately €7.0 million per business acquired. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed 18 acquisitions for a total revenue contribution of €204.8 million. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we completed 23 acquisitions for a total revenue contribution of €42.0 million. In the first nine months ended September 30, 2023, we completed seven acquisitions for a total revenue contribution of €22.4 million. Acquisitions affect our results of operations in several tangible ways. First, our results for the period during which an acquisition takes place are affected by the inclusion of the results of the acquired business in our consolidated results. As acquired businesses are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, the full impact of an acquisition is only reflected in our financial statements in the subsequent period. Furthermore, earn-out payments linked to our acquisitions may turn out to be significant. In addition to the accretive revenue and cost impact of acquisitions, we have historically been able to extract synergies and generate cost savings as a result of acquisitions. We acquire clinical laboratories with limited property, plant and equipment assets for a consideration that in many cases exceeds their net assets, which leads to significant amounts of goodwill being recognized on our consolidated statement of financial position (€2,323.4 million as of December 31, 2022 and €2,268.6 million as of September 30, 2023). Under IFRS, goodwill is recorded as an intangible asset and measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is subject to an impairment test annually and whenever there are indications of impairment. In 2020 and 2022 we recorded significant impairments in goodwill, including €115.0 million for our Swiss operations in 2020 and €213.0 million for our German operations in 2022. Changes in regulation can affect our ability to expand our laboratory network. In the past, such regulatory changes have only temporarily affected our acquisition strategy in the applicable country without having a significant impact on our ability to make acquisitions in other markets. We continuously monitor performance at the level of countries, segments, entity, contract or customer groups, with a reinforced focus on countries or segments with low margins (less than 10% Adjusted EBITDA Margin), divesting lower performing assets or assets that can be sold at highly accretive multiples. We evaluate market structure, degree of consolidation, critical scale required in the market, organic growth of laboratory testing services in the country and reimbursement and regulation trends. While the most immediate focus is on assets with Adjusted EBITDA Margins below 10%, we also aim to decrease the revenue contribution of businesses with margins below 20% (which contributed approximately 52% of our revenue in the first half of 2023) and look for opportunities to simplify our business model. The completed sale of our veterinary diagnostics business in Belgium, Germany and Spain in September 2023 and of our business operations in Switzerland in July 2023, are outcomes of such evaluation. These businesses were sold for attractive multiples and were margin accretive for the whole Group, with cash inflow from the sale of subsidiaries, net of cash disposed and changes in debt having amounted to €346 million. The proceeds have been reinvested and utilized for the purposes of deleveraging (including repaying in full €220 million of term loan B debt under a facility that was outstanding at the time in July 2023).",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

In March 2020, we began providing SARS-CoV-2 tests. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we conducted approximately 35 million SARS-CoV-2 tests and for the year ended December 31, 2022, we conducted approximately 20.5 million SARS-CoV-2 tests. In the first nine months ended September 30, 2023, the number of conducted SARS-CoV-2 tests further decreased significantly as ----- the emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic ended. The rapid roll out of SARS-CoV-2 tests offset a temporary decline in our standard routine and specialty diagnostic testing activity that occurred in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in March and April 2020. At the height of the pandemic in 2021 we generated €1,579.0 million of COVID-19-related revenue. In 2022, we generated €789.0 million of COVID-19-related revenue, which we expect to further decrease to around €40 million in 2023.

We have historically performed fewer tests during holiday and vacation periods, notably in the summer months, around the winter holidays and during periods of adverse weather conditions. The extent of the impact of the seasonality varies among the countries in which we operate and is also affected by the number of working days in a period. Our working capital requirements generally follow the seasonality of the business and are typically higher in the first quarter of the year, with fluctuations also occurring due to the timing of collections and the seasonal effects of payments by our principal customers, in particular public-sector or public-private organizations, such as INAMI in Belgium and the ASL regional health insurance funds in Italy, which tend to settle all the amounts they owe for the year on December 31 of each year. As a result, more cash is required to cover our working capital requirements over the first nine months of the financial year, while in the fourth quarter we enjoy the benefit of the cash generated by working capital. In addition, the seasonal effect on cash used as, or generated by, working capital usually tends to increase from one year to the next as a result of organic or acquisition-led growth in consolidated annual revenue.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

These services include mainly analysis and diagnostic testing services for human medicine, in particular clinical biological testing, including routine and specialty tests, anatomic pathology, histological or cytological testing and diagnostic imaging using medical and molecular imaging technologies. We apply the principles set out in IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) for revenue recognition by using the following five steps: - Identify the contract(s) with a customer. - Identify the performance obligations in the contract. - Determine the transaction price. - Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. - Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Our contracts with customers are grouped in major revenue streams and their substreams. Our major revenue streams are via two main channels, a B2B channel, consisting of all services performed for patients via provision to third-party entities and, a direct-to-patient approach via B2C or D2C channels, where the patient is in direct contact with SYNLAB and our services. Customers contracted within the B2B channel include hospitals, prescribers and physicians, laboratory-to-laboratory and corporates. Customers contracted within the B2C and D2C channels include retail and blood collection points and prevention and wellness tests, respectively. Activities performed to generate revenue include logistics, analytics and the provision of a result. Each contract has only one performance obligation since the service promised to the customer is an analysis and the combined output of the several activities are either not capable of being distinct or not distinct within the context of the contract. For the determination of the transaction price, the nature, timing and amount of consideration promised by a customer are taken into account, and, if applicable, variable consideration, significant financing components and non-cash consideration. Amounts collected on behalf of third parties are excluded. ----- Our most significant areas of revenue estimation relate to: - revenue recognized based on as yet, unconfirmed public health budgets, where revenue is estimated based on historical patterns together with other publicly available information (Germany and Italy being the most significant countries impacted); and - accrued revenue based on complete but unbilled tests, where the calculation of the value of those tests includes a level of estimation based on: `o` pricing mechanisms as agreed during contract negotiations and used to calculate average prices; `o` historical experience; and `o` actual work performed (e.g., analyses completed).

Taking into consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in ""—Factors Affecting Comparability"" above, the decrease in revenue was principally related to the continuing wind-down of the COVID-19 pandemic as the World Health Organization declared an end to the global health emergency phase of the pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 test volumes continued to rapidly decline. The estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our revenue declined significantly from COVID-19-related revenue having amounted to approximately €719.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to approximately €37.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding the estimated impact of the COVID-19-related revenue contribution, estimated underlying organic growth of 6.9% was composed of 5.4% of volume growth and 1.5% of favorable price increases. Total external revenue in France decreased by €134.7 million, or 25.5%, from €527.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €393.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Taking into consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in ""—Factors Affecting Comparability"" above, the overall decline was principally a result of reduced SARS-CoV-2 testing volumes. Excluding the estimated impact of the COVID-19-related revenue contribution, estimated underlying organic revenue in France decreased by 3.1%, largely driven by the decline of price by 4.5%, in line with the three years agreement with the French health authorities and partially offset by an increase in volume growth of 1.4%. Total external revenue in Germany decreased by €155.0 million, or 27.8%, from €556.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €401.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Taking into consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in ""—Factors Affecting Comparability"" above, the overall decline was principally a result of reduced SARS-CoV-2 testing volumes. Excluding the estimated impact of the COVID-19-related revenue contribution, estimated underlying organic growth of 13.0% was primarily driven by volume growth of 13.4% as a result of increase in volume of non-COVID19 related activities, with a slight decrease in prices of 0.3%. ----- Total external revenue in the South segment decreased by €128.0 million, or 17.2%, from €745.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €617.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Taking into consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in ""—Factors Affecting _Comparability"" above, the overall decline was principally a result of reduced SARS-CoV-2 testing_ volumes. Excluding the estimated impact of the COVID-19-related revenue contribution, estimated underlying organic revenue in the South segment decreased by 1.0%, largely driven by a 3.0% decrease in volume that was partially offset by price growth of 2.0%. Total external revenue in the North & East segment decreased by €141.8 million, or 19.7%, from €719.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €577.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Taking into consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in ""—Factors _Affecting Comparability"" above, the overall decline was principally a result of reduced SARS-CoV-2_ testing volumes. Excluding the estimated impact of the COVID-19-related revenue contribution, estimated underlying organic growth of 12.5% was driven by a combination of price growth of 6.9% resulting from price indexation and volume growth of 5.7%. In addition, the North & East segment benefited from favorable currency effects during the period. _Material and Related Expenses_ Material and related expenses decreased by €134.0 million, or 22.3%, from €600.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €466.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in material and related expenses was primarily due to the lower volume of testing which also required a lower number of reagents and consumables. Material and related expenses represented 23.5% of our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to 23.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. _Payroll and Related Expenses_ Payroll and related expenses decreased by €40.3 million, or 4.6%, from €881.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €841.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the overall lower number of employees as a result of the elimination of positions that were specifically designated for COVID-19-related functions, and was partially offset by the annual salary increases and staff hiring related to new activities. Payroll and related expenses represented 42.3% of our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to 34.6% of our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. _Other Operating Income_ Other operating income increased by €3.9 million, or 15.9%, from €24.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €28.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was partially due to our Italian subsidiaries receiving subsidies in the form of research grants relating to our expertise in nuclear medicine. _Other Operating Expenses_ Other operating expenses decreased by €41.4 million, or 9.5%, from €435.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €394.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was principally due to lower activity levels during the period, as evidenced by the decline in COVID-19related revenue. Other operating expenses represented 19.8% of our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to 17.1% of our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. _Depreciation and Amortization_ Depreciation and amortization remained relatively unchanged, increasing by €1.0 million, or less than 0.1%, from €217.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €218.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization represented 11.0% of our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to 8.5% in the nine months ended September 30, 2022. ----- _Impairment of Non-Current Assets_ Impairment of non-current assets decreased by €172.5 million, or 99.7%, from €173.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €0.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 2022 impairment related to an impairment of goodwill relating to our German business, primarily as a result of the rise in the yield of the 30-year German government bond that increased our weighted average cost of capital and the high inflationary environment that weakened our business outlook in Germany. _Operating Profit_ As a result of the factors described above, operating profit decreased by €168.3 million, or 63.4%, from €265.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €97.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. _Share of Loss of Associates and Other Non-controlling Interests_ Share of loss of associates and other non-controlling interests decreased by €1.3 million, or 67.1%, from €2.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €0.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. _Profit on disposal of investments_ Profit on disposal of investments increased by €112.6 million, or 159.4%, from €70.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €183.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the disposal of our veterinary business in Belgium, Germany and Spain and Swiss entities. _Finance Income_ Finance income decreased by €33.7 million, or 42.2%, from €79.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €46.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap and of the embedded derivative, resulting in lower derivative gains during the period, and from a decrease in exchange profit from realized and unrealized foreign currency gains from financial liabilities, which were partially offset by higher interest received on cash deposits. _Finance Costs_ Finance costs increased by €21.5 million, or 23.5%, from €91.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €112.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to rising interest rates on our floating rate term debt. We repaid €320.0 million of term debt during the period, which reduced our aggregate amount of outstanding debt, but the majority of such repayments occurred late in the nine-month period and therefore had a minimal offsetting impact on the overall increase. _Income Tax Expense_ Income tax expense decreased by €87.0 million, or 67.1%, from €129.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €42.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in operating profit. _Profit for the Period_ As a result of the factors described above, profit for the period decreased by €22.5 million, or 11.7%, from €192.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, to €170.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Taking into consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in ""—Factors Affecting Comparability"" above, the decrease in revenue was principally related to a significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 test volumes and prices as the COVID-19 pandemic was on a downward trend with immunity increasing due to the availability of vaccines. The estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our revenue declined significantly from COVID-19related revenue having amounted to approximately €1,579.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 to approximately €789.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Excluding the estimated impact of the COVID-19-related revenue contribution, estimated underlying organic growth of 6.2% was composed of 5.6% of volume growth and 0.6% of favorable price increases. Total external revenue in France decreased by €154.1 million, or 18.6%, from €828.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to €674.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. Taking into consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in ""—Factors Affecting Comparability"" above, the overall decline was principally a result of reduced SARS-CoV-2 testing volumes. Excluding the estimated impact of the COVID-19-related revenue contribution, estimated underlying organic revenue in France decreased by 1.0%, resulting from a 3.2% price decline, partially offset by a 2.2% volume increase. Total external revenue in Germany decreased by €19.5 million, or 2.7%, from €722.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to €703.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. Taking into consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in ""—Factors Affecting Comparability"" above, the overall decline was principally a result of reduced SARS-CoV-2 testing volumes. Excluding the estimated impact of the COVID-19-related revenue contribution, estimated underlying organic growth in Germany was 1.1%, resulting from due to a 1.4% volume increase, which was slightly offset by a 0.3% price decline. Total external revenue in the South segment decreased by €92.3 million, or 8.8%, from €1,052.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to €960.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. Taking into ----- consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in ""—Factors Affecting Comparability"" above, the overall decline was principally a result of reduced SARS-CoV-2 testing volumes. Excluding the estimated impact of the COVID-19-related revenue contribution, estimated underlying organic revenue in the South segment increased by 1.7%, resulting from a 1.4% price increase and 0.3% higher volumes. In particular, underlying organic growth for our Latin American operations was 2.8%, primarily as a result of price increases. Total external revenue in the North & East segment decreased by €248.5 million, or 21.4%, from €1,161.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to €912.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. Taking into consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in ""—Factors Affecting _Comparability"" above, the overall decline was principally a result of reduced SARS-CoV-2 testing_ volumes. Excluding the estimated impact of the COVID-19-related revenue contribution, estimated underlying organic growth of 21.8% was mainly due to the volume growth resulting from ramp-up of our Synnovis NHS hospital outsourcing contract in South East London, and also included a slight increase in pricing and driven by inflation indexation mechanisms in many of the North & East countries. _Material and Related Expenses_ Material and related expenses decreased by €165.5 million, or 17.6%, from €942.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to €776.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in material and related expenses was primarily due to the lower volume of testing which also required lower number of reagents and consumables. For the year ended December 31, 2022, reagents and consumables represented 34.7% and 19.5% of material and related expenses, respectively. Material and related expenses represented 23.9% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 25.0% in the year ended December 31, 2021. _Payroll and Related Expenses_ Payroll and related expenses increased by €27.8 million, or 2.4%, from €1,138.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to €1,166.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to a higher average number of employees which increased from 27,337 to 29,153, which was a result of increased hiring for COVID-19-related functions during the year. Payroll and related expenses represented 30.3% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021, which included €2.1 million related to share-based payments. For the year ended December 31, 2022, salaries and wages represented 65.1% of payroll and related expenses, followed by social security contributions at 20.1%, other personnel costs (including bonus payments and premiums) at 8.6% and subcontracting and temporary staff expenses at 5.9%. Payroll and related expenses represented 35.9% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2022, which included €3.6 million related to share-based payments. _Other Operating Income_ Other operating income decreased by €6.8 million, or 16.0%, from €42.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to €35.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was partially due to lower income from foreign currency transactions. _Other Operating Expenses_ Other operating expenses increased by €50.4 million, or 9.2%, from €546.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to €596.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to a general increase in operating expenses including IT and administration expenses, utilities (e.g., energy expenses), higher consulting and advisory fees and higher transportation expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2022, IT and administration expenses and utilities were the largest categories of our other operating expenses, having represented 15.7% and 15.6% of our overall other operating expenses, respectively, while transportation expenses and consulting and advisory fees represented 15.2% and 12.7% of other operating expenses, respectively. Other operating expenses represented 14.5% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 18.4% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2022. Restructuring and other significant expenses amounted to €22.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 but only amounted to €0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. Restructuring and other significant expenses in 2021 mainly related to the costs of our initial public offering. ----- _Depreciation and Amortization_ Depreciation and amortization increased by €35.9 million, or 13.5%, from €265.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to €301.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher amortization for right of use assets and an increase in the depreciation of property, particularly the accelerated depreciation of COVID-19 machinery, plant and equipment as well as, to a lesser extent, higher amortization of customer relationships. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue was 9.3% for the year ended December 31, 2022. _Impairment of Non-Current Assets_ Impairment of non-current assets amounted to €213.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 while there were no such impairments in 2021. The 2022 impairment related to an impairment of goodwill for our German business principally as a consequence of the impact of the overall geopolitical situation on our German business, specifically the rise in the yield of the 30-year German government bond that increased our weighted average cost of capital and the high inflationary environment that weakened our business outlook in Germany. _Operating Profit_ As a result of the factors described above, operating profit decreased by €682.9 million, or 74.7%, from €914.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to €231.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. _Finance Income_ Finance income increased by €20.7 million, or 31.5%, from €65.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to €86.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher derivative gains during the period and higher interest received on cash deposits. _Finance Costs_ Finance costs decreased by €64.4 million, or 38.4%, from €168.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to €103.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a significantly changed debt profile after the completion of our initial public offering, including lower interest expenses of €32.8 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2022, compared to €73.3 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, in 2022, a financial expense of €28.5 million in relation to financial assets at fair value was recorded in the income statement without a comparable expense in 2021. _Income Tax Expense_ Income tax expense decreased by €64.9 million, or 33.2%, from €195.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to €130.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower current tax expenses in the year ended December 31, 2022 due to lower net profits in the different jurisdictions we operate in. _Profit for the Period from Continuing Operations_ As a result of the factors described above, profit for the period from continuing operations decreased by €457.8 million, or 75.0%, from €610.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to €152.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Taking into consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in ""—Factors Affecting Comparability"" above, the increase was primarily due to volume growth as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and underlying business expansion. The estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our revenue was an approximately €1,560.0 million net increase for the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting an approximately €1,600.0 million revenue contribution from SARS-CoV-2 testing, which was partially offset by an estimated approximately €39 million attrition impact from confinement measures that temporarily decreased non-SARS-CoV-2 testing volumes below expected volumes. The estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was an approximately €620 to €630 million net increase for the year, including an estimated attrition impact of approximately €175 to €185 million. Excluding the estimated impact of the COVID-19-related revenue contribution and the positive impact of lower attrition, estimated underlying organic growth of 9.6% primarily reflected volume growth and the contribution of our Synnovis hospital outsourcing contract in South East London. Total external revenue in France increased by €181.8 million, or 28.1%, from €646.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, to €828.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. Taking into consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in ""—Factors Affecting Comparability"" above, the increase was primarily due to high SARS-CoV-2 testing volumes. Excluding the estimated revenue impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the positive impact of lower rates of attrition, estimated underlying organic growth of approximately 0.7% was primarily driven by solid volume growth offsetting the regulatory price decrease as per the three year agreement with the French health authorities, implemented in the second quarter of the year ended December 31, 2021. Total external revenue in Germany increased by €142.8 million, or 24.6%, from €579.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, to €722.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. Taking into consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in ""—Factors Affecting Comparability"" above, the increase was primarily due to high SARS-CoV-2 testing volumes, with a peak in activity in the final weeks of the year. Excluding the estimated revenue impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the positive ----- impact of lower rates of attrition, estimated underlying organic growth of approximately 1.7% was primarily driven by good volume growth and limited price decline overall. Total external revenue in the South segment increased by €253.3 million, or 31.7%, from €799.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, to €1,052.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. Taking into consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in ""—Factors Affecting Comparability"" above, the increase was due to good underlying growth and high SARS-CoV-2 testing volumes. Excluding the revenue impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the positive impact of lower rates of attrition, underlying organic growth was approximately 4.9% including network expansion, in Italy and Latin America. Total external revenue in the North & East segment increased by €565.9 million, or 95.1%, from €595.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, to €1,161.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. Taking into consideration the revenue impact of the factors discussed in ""—Factors Affecting _Comparability"" above, the increase was due to good underlying growth and high SARS-CoV-2 testing_ volumes and a strong growth in the United Kingdom. Excluding the estimated revenue impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the positive impact of lower rates of attrition, estimated underlying organic growth of approximately 33.7% was primarily driven by our Synnovis hospital outsourcing contract in South East London, positive pricing and the ""For You"" growth initiatives. Key ""For You"" growth initiatives included blood collection point openings in Belgium, connecting with doctors in Austria and web services in the Nordic countries. _Material and Related Expenses_ Material and related expenses increased by €257.9 million, or 37.7%, from €684.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, to €942.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in material and related expenses was primarily due to testing volume growth, and was partially offset by €9.0 million in savings from the SALIX program, in addition to the core laboratory equipment renewal project and delivering cost efficiencies for PCR test reagents. Material and related expenses represented 25.0% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 26.1% in the year ended December 31, 2020. _Payroll and Related Expenses_ Payroll and related expenses increased by €230.7 million, or 25.4%, from €908.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, to €1,138.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and wages, as well as social security contributions. Payroll and related expenses represented 30.3% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021, which included €2.1 million related to share-based payments. Payroll and related expenses represented 34.6% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020, which included €3.6 million related to share-based payments. _Other Operating Income_ Other operating income increased by €23.5 million, or 123.3%, from €19.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, to €42.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to an increase in grants and state aid for COVID-19. _Other Operating Expenses_ Other operating expenses increased by €155.5 million, or 39.8%, from €390.8 million (for comparative reasons including Restructuring and other significant expenses and acquisition-related (income)/expenses previously disclosed separately) in the year ended December 31, 2020, to €546.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases in transportation expenses, IT and administration expenses, utilities and other expenses. Other operating expenses represented 14.9% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020. Other operating expenses represented 14.5% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021. Restructuring and other significant expenses increased by €5.7 million, or 33.2%, from €17.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, to €22.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021.

The increase was primarily due to our increased acquisition activities. _Depreciation and Amortization_ Depreciation and amortization increased by €39.1 million, or 17.3%, from €226.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, to €265.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due increased amount of amortization in the right of use assets and other intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue was 7.0% for the year ended December 31, 2021. _Impairment of Non-Current Assets_ Impairment of non-current assets decreased from €115.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 to nil in the year ended December 31, 2021. _Operating Profit_ As a result of the factors described above, operating profit increased by €599.0 million, or 189.9%, from €315.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, to €914.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. _Finance Income_ Finance income increased by €45.6 million, or 224.1%, from €20.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, to €65.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to beneficial changes in the fair value of financial instruments. _Finance Costs_ Finance costs decreased by €40.6 million, or 19.4%, from €208.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, to €168.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a combination of lower borrowings and lower borrowing costs. _Income Tax Expense_ Income tax expense increased by €108.0 million, or 123.7%, from €87.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, to €195.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021.

Our approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that we will always have sufficient liquidity to meet our liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to our reputation. This planning considers the maturity of both our financial assets, and our projected cash flow from operations. Typically, we ensure that we have sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period of 60 days, including the servicing of financial obligations. In addition, we maintain a line of credit, via our Existing Revolving Credit Facility (and, following the Completion Date, the New Revolving Credit Facility), under which drawings could be made for financing acquisitions or for general financing purposes. Under these covenants, if we do not respect contractual requirements, this may result in preventing of future drawing on the undrawn facility.

Our primary exposure to credit risk relates to our trade accounts receivables. We limit our exposure to credit risk by investing mainly in liquid securities with counterparties that have a high credit rating. Management actively monitors its investments and does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations. Our exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. We have no significant concentrations of credit risks due to the large numbers of customers and individual immateriality of amounts due. We have adopted the simplified expected credit loss model for our trade receivables. We always measure the loss allowance for trade receivables at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. To measure the expected credit losses, trade accounts receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The computation of expected credit losses is performed by means of a default risk matrix, which is based on the historical default rates grouped by trade receivables class and aging buckets. Moreover, reasonable and supportable information (if available without undue cost or effort) at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions have been taken into account in the calculations. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.1,Overview,18.1.1,Diagnostic Services Sector,"The diagnostic services sector comprises businesses and laboratories that offer analytic or diagnostic testing services including clinical biological testing (both routine and specialty), anatomic pathology testing (both histological and cytological samples) and diagnostic imaging (employing medical and nuclear imaging technologies). Diagnostic services are a critical factor in medical decisions and increase the efficiency of healthcare systems, with around 70% of treatment decisions being based on laboratory test results, while only accounting for 2–3% of healthcare spend. Prompt and accurate diagnoses improve the quality of care and reduce the ultimate cost of medication and hospitalization. Aided by technological and medical advances, the healthcare industry's focus is increasingly shifting from the treatment of existing conditions to the prevention and early detection of medical conditions. This shift, coupled with structural growth trends in our key markets such as aging populations and a growing prevalence of chronic diseases, as well as greater reliance on hospital outsourcing, are leading to an increasing reliance on diagnostic testing services and, consequently, rising demand for clinical laboratory services. Diagnostic testing is generally organized in three phases: (i) the pre-analytical phase, which consists of collecting samples and delivering them to the clinical laboratory; (ii) the analytical phase, during which the test itself is carried out; and (iii) the post-analytical phase, during which test results are sent to the prescribing doctor and the patient and laboratory doctors validate the results and assist with interpreting the results. After a patient experiences medical symptoms and engages with the healthcare system, laboratory services are involved in the critical stages of information gathering (through sample collections and transfer to laboratory facilities), analysis, information integration and interpretation, and the development of working diagnoses. Once the laboratory communicates results to physicians or patients, treatment can begin.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Our addressable market, inclusive of COVID-19-related services, grew from approximately €23 billion in 2018 to approximately €32 billion in 2022 at approximately a 6.7% CAGR, ----- with the COVID-19 effect strongest during the period from 2020 to 2022. Our addressable market is estimated to be approximately €28 billion in 2023 and predicted to grow at a 3–4% CAGR to €34 billion in 2028, primarily driven by volume increases. The market is evenly split between our core European market countries (Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom), and emerging and other markets, both segments accounting for €14 billion in 2023. Our core European market is expected to grow at a 2% CAGR to €16 billion in 2028 while the emerging and rest of the other markets are expected to grow at a 6% CAGR to €18 billion in 2028. We expect the increased focus and awareness on diagnostics and disease prevention associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to a rise in accelerated innovation on the provider side, increase access to diagnostic services across the globe and will result in rising testing volumes in the longer term, accelerating the existing trends. In addition, new market opportunities arising from precision medicine, D2C offerings, artificial intelligence and point-of-care testing are estimated to total approximately €12 billion in Europe, estimated to grow to approximately €24 billion by 2028 at a 14.4% CAGR. We have a growing presence in Latin America where the addressable market size (excluding the impact of COVID-19) is expected to increase from €6 billion to €9 billion at approximately a 10% CAGR between 2023 and 2028, where we operate a full spectrum of routine and specialty testing services with business models and regulations, which vary on a country-to-country basis. Brazil is the largest market in Latin America at €3–5 billion, followed by Chile at €0.7–1.0 billion, Peru at €0.3–0.7 billion and Colombia at €0.3–0.4 billion in 2023. The market is expected to expand primarily due to volume growth, as there is increased demand for private healthcare, supported by increasing affordability for the middle and upper middle classes across Latin America. While some markets such as Brazil are more consolidated, other markets such as Colombia, Peru and Chile have a medium to low degree of consolidation in the market with M&A opportunities for small chains. Foreign currency exchange rates and political instability are key risk factors across the region that need to be navigated while operating in the Latin America market. The chart below shows the historical growth of the accessible diagnostic laboratory services market by geographies in billions of euros.

The proportion of our revenue generated from emerging markets and countries outside the eurozone has increased since 2018. In 2018, emerging market countries (namely, Belarus, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Czechia, Ecuador, Ghana, Hungary, North Macedonia, Mexico, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, Romania, Türkiye and the United Arab Emirates) provided 12% of our revenue, which was consistent with mature non-euro countries (namely, Croatia, Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom), which also provided 12% of revenue. The remaining 76% was provided by euro countries (namely, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain). For the nine months ----- ended September 30, 2023, the revenue contribution of emerging market countries grew to 14%, mature non-euro countries provided 16% and euro countries provided 69%.

504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.2,Clinical Laboratory Services Sector in Europe,18.2.1,Overview,"The overall clinical laboratory services sector in Europe comprises both public and private laboratory service providers, which collectively offer services across a range of scientific areas, including general clinical laboratory testing, or testing of body fluids for abnormalities (e.g., blood cell counts, coagulation, iron levels, cholesterol); microbiology, or testing for the presence of microbiological pathogens (e.g., differentiation, antibiotic resistance, influenza tests); anatomic pathology and cytology, or testing of cells and tissue samples for abnormalities (e.g., analysis of tumor marks, pap-smears); and constitutional genetics, or testing of genetic material for abnormalities (e.g., analysis of risk factors, analysis of fetal DNA for mutations). Clinical laboratory testing is used in all scientific areas and can be broadly divided into routine testing and specialty testing. Routine clinical laboratory tests are regularly used in general patient care by doctors to establish or support a diagnosis, to monitor treatment or to search for an otherwise undiagnosed condition. Routine testing is highly automated, scale driven, and efficiency oriented. Specialty clinical laboratory tests involve a higher level of complexity than routine tests, are conducted by skilled laboratory professionals and generally utilize more sophisticated technology, equipment or materials. Due to technological progress and innovation, the boundary between routine and specialty testing is constantly changing. As certain specialty tests become processable on automated test equipment, the cost per test falls, allowing the process to eventually become part of routine testing. In addition, the spectrum of specialty tests continues to expand through the introduction of new and innovative tests. The customer base In the clinical laboratory services market Is diverse and spans both the public and private sectors. Customers include individual patients as well as hospitals, public and private clinics, medical practices and laboratories, physicians, blood collection points, public health agencies, pharmaceutical companies, clinical research organizations and companies in connection with occupational health policies, among others. The clinical laboratory service market can be grouped into three major business models: B2B, B2C and D2C. In the B2B model, hospitals, individual general or specialist practices and other laboratories send samples in for testing through an outsourcing model. We largely operate the B2B model in Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. B2C and D2C patients visit a blood collection point. Patients with prescriptions for specific tests serve as the customers in the B2C model, where the customer has the choice to select a laboratory service provider. D2C testing also has patients as the customer, but these services are paid outof-pocket and without a prescription. Typically, customers choose blood collection points based on proximity and quality. Pricing methods differ across the models, with B2B and B2C pricing largely driven by national regulation regarding reimbursement, whereas there is greater flexibility in pricing for D2C. Today, most tests are conducted via B2B and B2C models while D2C constitutes a small minority in our addressable markets. Depending on applicable law and regulation, diagnostic services are typically covered by statutory health insurance (""SHI"") or private health insurance (""PHI"") providers. Other testing services are freely negotiated, such as under hospital outsourcing contracts, or are paid for out of pocket by patients (if not covered by their SHI or PHI provider) or other private payers. Our addressable European clinical laboratory service market, with a current market size of €16 billion, is expected to grow in the low single digits annually over the coming years. Large parts of the market remain unconsolidated and there are currently only a few pan-European players. The nature of competition in the clinical laboratory services sector varies by country, largely due to different market characteristics and ----- regulatory regimes. The overall market has experienced consolidation in recent years, driven in part by regulatory changes and perceived potential for value creation. We expect this trend to continue in the future. In our view, the increasing pressure on governments to reduce healthcare spending is likely to lead to greater outsourcing of hospital laboratory work which, in turn, will drive further volume growth for private laboratory operators and increase the portion of the accessible market for private clinical laboratory service providers like us. We believe that large laboratory networks such as ours will be the main beneficiaries of this development, due to our ability to leverage economies of scale, greater financial resources and experience in operating complex hospital outsourcing contracts, among other advantages. The diversity of healthcare systems in Europe also means that the provision of clinical laboratory services varies from country to country, particularly in relation to: - _Density of private clinical laboratories and professionals: The density of private laboratories varies across regions and countries in Europe. Countries such France or Italy have a relatively higher number of laboratories compared to Germany or the United Kingdom. There is also significant variance in terms of how many qualified laboratory doctors and pharmacists there are across countries. - _Regulations: Regulations relating to the qualification of laboratory doctors and laboratory personnel, technical conditions for testing, professional independence of laboratory doctors and conditions for owning, establishing and operating clinical laboratories vary by country. See ""Regulation."" - _Quality standards: In some countries, national or regional regulations require, or in the future will require, the accreditation of all clinical laboratories, while other countries accept internal quality management standards. - _Pricing of clinical laboratory tests: The prices of clinical laboratory services in most countries in Europe are, to a large extent, regulated. Significant disparities in tariffs persist; for example, prices per test are generally higher in France than in Spain. In countries such as Spain, regulated prices in private clinical laboratory services have been replaced by contractually negotiated prices with private third-party payers. - _Choice of laboratory: Depending on the country, the clinical laboratory performing tests for a patient is chosen by the patient, by their doctor or by the patient's health insurance provider.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.2,Clinical Laboratory Services Sector in Europe,18.2.2,Market Characteristics,"The medical diagnostics industry, to a large extent, has attractive market characteristics with advantages for established market participants. Cross-border consolidation among some of the established market participants is expected and potential penetration of the European sector, by some of the major nonEuropean laboratory groups, cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, only a very limited number of significant new market participants are likely to emerge organically. This is mainly due to factors such as economies of scale, regulatory requirements, required technical know-how and reputation that give established market participants a strong advantage. Economies of scale exist at multiple stages of our value chain (e.g., for procurement, logistics, test processing) and for professional training and development, as well as building and maintaining relationships with customers, regulators and payers. The presence of such economies of scale can be advantageous to larger players who are better able to benefit from efficiencies in procurement by bundling volumes across laboratories and geographies, which assists them in adjusting to price cuts. Similarly, larger players are better able to operate an integrated laboratory model, which utilizes centralized laboratories combined with geographically dispersed base laboratories and collection centers. Regulatory requirements and characteristics include a complex variety of pricing and reimbursement environments, strict quality standards, long-term contracts and complex licensing and accreditation processes in some countries. Market participants, including us, with enhanced experience in dealing with the various national reimbursement environments and established relationships with important customers and suppliers enjoy advantages over new market participants. ----- Customer churn rates in our market are relatively low, as patients and doctors are satisfied with their established laboratories with clinical diagnostics convenient and integrated into doctors' daily clinical practice. This low customer churn constitutes a competitive edge for us and other established market participants. In addition, bigger and more established market participants benefit from advantages in attracting and retaining leading scientists as employees due to their scientific reputation and technical abilities and capacity to invest in new technologies, in particular with respect to specialized test services. Larger size allows for more flexibility in identifying and applying advanced technologies and best practices in selected specialized test segments. Building a reputation as a reliable, high-quality service provider takes time and may be a potential challenge for new participants.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.3,Clinical Laboratory Services Market by Geography,18.3.1,France,"The French diagnostic laboratory services market is expected to be approximately €9.7 billion in 2023 (excluding COVID-19) of which accessible market for private laboratories amounted to approximately €4.8 billion (approximately 50% of the total market). The accessible market is expected to grow from €4.8 billion in 2023 to €5.0 billion in 2028 at a 1% CAGR, with volume growth at a 2–3% CAGR partially offset by forecasted price declines of approximately a 1 to 3% CAGR. This market grew at a 0.1% CAGR from 2019 to 2023, below the 1% CAGR from €4.6 billion in 2015 to €4.8 billion in 2019. The French clinical laboratory services market is highly regulated. It is estimated that more than 80% of the French healthcare market in 2022 was funded by the French social security system. In France, doctors prescribe clinical tests for their non-hospitalized patients, who are free to choose the laboratory in which they are tested. Patients typically choose a laboratory based on proximity to their home or workplace. Accordingly, presence in high traffic locations and reputation for quality of services are key factors. Prices for clinical tests are set by a commission consisting of representatives from the Ministry for Social Affairs, Health and Women's Rights, UNCAM and professional bodies. Tests for which reimbursement is authorized are included in a quotation grid of clinical tests and quantified by the letter B. The rate for a specific test is determined by multiplying the value of B and the coefficient allocated to that specific test. Generally, more specialized and newer tests are initially not included in the quotation grid and thus not initially reimbursed. Non-inclusion in the quotation grid also means that prices for such tests are not fixed. The coefficient assigned to each test in the NABM nomenclature list is revised and updated yearly by a commission including the French social security system and unions. Depending on the uptake of the test or the therapeutic advantages offered, UNCAM may seek advice from the Haute Autorité de Santé (""HAS"") regarding its inclusion in the quotation grid. HAS will base its advice on the indications for which the proposed service is assessed, identifying, where appropriate, the population groups affected; a description of the role in therapeutic strategy; and an assessment of the improvement offered by the proposed service compared to alternative standard therapeutic approaches based on current scientific data, notably with regard to the comparative effectiveness of these treatments. The improvement offered by the proposed service is evaluated for each indication and, where appropriate, population group. With or without this advice, a commission decides whether inclusion in the quotation grid is merited and sets the price as determined by UNCAM. This commission consists of six biologists representing the profession (trade unions) and three UNCAM representatives (each with two votes), and a chairman, elected by the commission, who has one vote. UNCAM has the final decision on proposing the inclusion of a test in the quotation grid and submitting its proposal to the minister. If the minister accepts the proposal the test is included in the quotation grid via advertisement in the Official Journal. Effective from 2023, the B-factor was cut by 3.7% from €0.27 to €0.26 with the aim to claw back COVID19-related profits from private laboratories. No agreement on a three-year contract could be reached in 2022, therefore the rates were only fixed for 2023. In July 2023, the four medical biologists unions and UNCAM agreed on a 0.4% increase in the spending budget for the French health insurance system to laboratories for the period 2024 to 2026. This implies an approximately 2.6% price cut for the period if a 3% growth in volume in line with the historical period is assumed. While there had been concern around steeper price ----- cuts, the expected price cuts for laboratories corresponding to the spending budget were lower than expected. This demonstrates regulators taking a long-term view on the profitability of the sector and also ensures smaller market participants are not unduly affected. In relation to the COVID-19 period, there was a significant growth in testing volumes (particularly SARSCoV-2 PCR tests) from the second quarter of 2020 through 2021. As the pandemic waned, there was a notable decline in SARS-CoV-2 tests in 2022. Additional volumes in 2022 from the delays during the pandemic in discretionary surgeries and postponed regular cancer screenings had limited counter-balancing effect to the decreasing SARS-CoV-2 testing volumes. The catch-up effect is estimated to represent 0.5% of the volume in 2023. These catch-up effects in elective surgeries and cancer screenings are only temporary and are expected to end by 2024. From 2025 and beyond, SARS-CoV-2 test volumes as a proportion of the regular routine test market are forecasted to be limited (3% of total routine tests by 2024). Being the fourth largest player in France, we are well positioned to benefit from consolidation opportunities in the French clinical laboratory services market. Several factors drive this consolidation, including the high number of smaller laboratories in France employing low levels of automation; price cuts undertaken to offset rising testing volumes, which create an erosion of margins that can be offset by the use of increasingly large centers; the requirement that all laboratories operating as legal entities be accredited by COFRAC, which creates substantial financial hurdles and operational constraints for small and independent laboratories; aging biologists, with approximately 37% expected to retire in the next ten years. These factors driving consolidation are reflected in the significant decrease in number of private laboratories. It should be noted that the consolidation trend in the French market is continuing but at a reduced pace given the rapid growth via buy and build models in the last decade.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.3,Clinical Laboratory Services Market by Geography,18.3.2,Germany,"Germany is the largest clinical laboratory services market in Europe, with a total market value of approximately €10.6 billion in 2023 (excluding COVID-19), of which accessible market for private laboratories amounted to approximately €5.7 billion. This accessible market is expected to grow from €5.7 billion in 2023 to €6.6 billion in 2028 at a 3–3.5% CAGR supported by stable pricing (0% CAGR estimated) and favorable volume growth of 2.5–3.5% CAGR. This market grew at a 2% CAGR from €5.4 billion in 2019 to €5.7 billion in 2023, slightly behind the 3% CAGR from €4.7 billion in 2015 to €5.4 billion in 2019. With respect to customers, the total German clinical laboratory services market can be divided into an outpatient sector, consisting mainly of general practitioners, internists and other office-based specialists, and an inpatient sector, consisting mainly of hospitals. In Germany, general practitioners are responsible for collecting samples with their own staff, usually nurses or medical technical assistants. In return, they are free to choose a clinical laboratory to test the sample. General practitioners are allowed to perform certain tests themselves, primarily basic routine tests. Private practice general practitioners frequently form laboratory cooperations (Laborgemeinschaften) to perform routine tests. Specialized tests are sent to clinical laboratory service providers. Working with laboratory cooperations gives clinical laboratory service providers access to specialty testing prescribed by general practitioners and reduces customer churn. We benefit from the increased outsourcing of laboratory services by hospitals and have entered into significant cooperations in the hospital laboratory outsourcing sector. We have the necessary laboratory and testing capacity, logistics networks, the ability to meet turnaround times and the availability of specialty laboratory doctors. Agreements with hospitals are freely negotiated and include agreements for full outsourcing of certain hospitals' laboratory testing (i.e., routine and specialty). Particularly in connection with efforts to control costs in smaller hospitals, there are further opportunities for outsourcing of laboratory services of public hospitals in Germany. Growth in the forecast period is primarily driven by underlying volumes, increased outsourcing share given cost pressures and relatively stable pricing and minor reimbursement pressure. Underlying volume growth is driven by demographic trends of aging populations and migration, and the continued move towards personalized medicine and illness prevention rather than treatment. Furthermore, we have a strong presence in Southern Germany which has higher margins due to high PHI exposure. Pricing pressure is expected to be relatively limited in the period to 2028. Reimbursement changes came into force in 2018, which led to a temporary slow-down but has had no substantial long-term implications, and prices from 2023 to 2028 are expected to remain in line with the period from 2018 to 2022. Our analysis ----- indicates that industry leaders expect staffing shortages and energy prices to influence laboratory services margins. Reform of the statutory scale of fees for physicians (Gebührenordnung für Ärzte, ""GOÄ"") is viewed as an unlikely mid-term threat given its political nature and continued delays and potential EBM adjustments are expected to be relatively minor. While it cannot be excluded that a GOÄ reform would be agreed upon in the current legislative period (i.e., before 2025), it should be noted that such reform would require years of implementation following approval. Although unlikely in the mid-term, GOÄ reform could have a substantial impact with an approximately 10% price cut regarded as feasible, which would affect the PHI market (20% of total market in 2022). The SARS-CoV-2 PCR test market grew steeply in 2020 and peaked in 2021 with high volumes and dropped to steady-state levels in 2023 at approximately €0.2 billion. COVID-19 revenues are forecasted to be approximately €120 million from 2023 to 2028. Over the pandemic, routine testing volumes decreased in 2021 and 2022 with this backlog to be cleared over 2023 (backlog equates to 0.5 to 1% of 2023 volumes). From 2025 and beyond, SARS-CoV-2 test volumes as a proportion of the regular routine test market are forecasted to be limited (approximately 2% of total routine tests by end of 2023). The clinical laboratory services market in Germany is somewhat less fragmented than that of other European countries, with the top five players estimated to have approximately 54% of the accessible market by revenue in 2022 and the top three players accounting for approximately 41% of the accessible market by revenue in the same period. We estimate that the remainder of the accessible market consists of approximately 330 small-to-medium-sized laboratories with a regional focus. As a top three player, we expect to continue benefitting from consolidation in the market, driven primarily by efforts of the larger clinical laboratory groups to expand their geographical footprint, increase specialization to improve our exposure to the profitable specialist customer segment and take advantage of economies of scale in a highly competitive marketplace. Consolidation is expected to occur at a slower rate than in the past given the small laboratory market is constantly decreasing.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.3,Clinical Laboratory Services Market by Geography,18.3.3,Italy,"The Italian diagnostic laboratory services market is expected to be approximately €5.6 billion in 2023 (excluding COVID-19) of which accessible market for private laboratories amounted to approximately €2.9 billion (approximately 52% of the total market). The accessible market is expected to grow from €2.9 billion in 2023 to €3.2 billion in 2028 at a 2–3% CAGR with volume growth at a 2–3% CAGR, supported by stable pricing (0% CAGR estimated). This market grew at a 2% CAGR from €2.6 billion in 2019 to €2.9 billion in 2023, ahead of a period of flat growth from 2015 to 2019. The market growth is driven primarily by underlying volume growth (2–3% per year) caused by the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases in an aging population and by the increased proportion accessible to private players through more outsourcing and out-of-pocket spend. Increased out-of-pocket spend is due to an underfunded national healthcare authority (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, ""SSN"") and long waiting times. No major national cuts are expected in pricing although some decrease in reimbursement rates and budgets over time. The Italian healthcare system is mainly funded by a mix of public taxes and co-payments by patients. In 2022, public spending accounted for the majority of total healthcare expenditures while private spending accounted for the rest. Most of the private spending was out-of-pocket payments, with a smaller part paid by private health insurance payers. The Italian healthcare system is organized into three levels: national, regional and local. Generally, in the case of tests covered by the SSN, prior to undergoing any test, a patient must pay a fee that covers only part of the test's actual cost. The amount of this prepayment varies by region and according to the patient's social eligibility criteria. The remaining portion of the cost is covered by the SSN or by private healthcare insurers. The SSN provides guidelines for prices applicable to accredited private clinical laboratories. However, regional authorities (Azienda Sanitaria Locale, ""ASL"") have the authority to set local prices above or below national guidelines. On an annual basis, each accredited private clinical laboratory must sign an agreement with local authorities that determines the specific reimbursement rules for prices and the total budget allocated to the laboratory for the year. Once the annual budget has been reached, which generally occurs in the final quarter of the year, ASLs will no longer, or only partly, reimburse the tests carried out by the clinical laboratories which requires patients to pay for tests themselves. As a result, reimbursement levels vary widely from region to region. In the unlikely case that the annual budgets allocated by the ASLs for a ----- given year are not fully used by the end of the year, a revision aiming to lower such budgets for the next year is possible. In Italy, outpatients' doctors prescribe clinical tests and patients are free to choose the clinical laboratory in which the tests are conducted. Patients typically choose a laboratory based on proximity to their home or workplace. Large clinical laboratories in Italy typically offer an integrated diagnostic testing service, providing clinical testing, diagnostic imaging services, ambulatory care and other healthcare services. No major changes occurred in the Italian diagnostic laboratories market caused by COVID-19 in terms of market dynamics or regulation. Volumes of SARS-CoV-2 tests were high across 2020 and 2021, with SARS-CoV-2 testing as a percentage of the accessible market reducing to 2% in 2023. There were small backlog effects caused by COVID-19 in 2022 and 2023 causing approximately 1% additional volume growth. We believe the high fragmentation (with the top three players accounting for approximately 17% of the accessible market in 2022), the relative decentralization and overall pricing dynamics of the Italian clinical laboratory services market, present significant further opportunities for consolidation, which we are well positioned to capitalize on given that we are co-leaders with one other player in the market and have the broadest business model.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.3,Clinical Laboratory Services Market by Geography,18.3.4,United Kingdom,"The United Kingdom's laboratory services market is expected to be approximately €4.4 billion in 2023 (excluding COVID-19) of which the accessible market for private laboratories amounted to approximately €0.7 billion (approximately 16% of the total market). The accessible market is expected to grow from €0.7 billion in 2023 to €1.0 billion in 2028 at a 6% CAGR with volume growth at a 7% CAGR and partially offset by the forecasted price decreases of approximately a 1% CAGR. This market grew at a 5% CAGR from €0.6 billion in 2019 to €0.7 billion in 2023, slightly ahead of the 4% CAGR from €0.5 billion in 2015 to €0.6 billion in 2019. Growth is forecast to accelerate from 2023 to 2025 as the National Health Service (""NHS"") works through and outsources the backlog of tests from the COVID-19 pandemic. During the peak of the pandemic in 2020, non-COVID-19-related volumes dropped by 50–70% and the corresponding pandemic backlog is forecasted to be €85–95 million in 2023 and 2024. Volume growth will be driven by a larger accessible share of the market resulting from increased outsourcing due to financial pressures in the NHS. Clinical laboratory services in the United Kingdom can be either private or public and can be provided as part of a hospital stay (i.e., inpatient services), or outside of a hospital setting (i.e., outpatient services). The NHS dominates the total market for clinical laboratory services. The market for private clinical laboratory services, in which we are one of the major players, consists of outsourced NHS work as well as private individual, hospital group and corporate spending. In the current NHS system, the patient sees a general practitioner in the community, then queues at the public hospital to have his or her blood taken. The taking of the blood may take a couple of hours to be processed, and the results may take some time to come back. Since 2000, the United Kingdom has moved to open independent treatment centers (""ITCs""). These ITCs treat NHS patients but are owned and run by private companies. In turn, these ITCs outsource their tests to a private clinical laboratory provider. The aim of this is twofold: to help remove the hidden waiting time between seeing the doctor and receiving a final diagnosis, which in turn helps reduce waiting times for surgery and improves clinical outcomes. About one-third of independent hospital clinical laboratory work is undertaken from NHS trusts' laboratories. This has risen due to the development of NHS private patient facilities. The diagnostic testing for patients in NHS beds and private patients in public hospitals is generally undertaken by the laboratory that performs the hospital diagnostic testing. In almost all cases this testing is performed in-house by the NHS trust itself. The remaining proportion of independent diagnostic testing is outsourced to the private sector. As a cost initiative, the NHS has for some time aimed to decrease spending on diagnostic testing, with potential outsourcing to the private sector being described since 2008. (Source: Lord Carter of Coles report). With growing NHS waiting times and backlog, market participants expect increased outsourcing from NHS, including working with NHS trusts to develop a partnership model. Our Synnovis partnership with Guy's ----- and St Thomas' and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trusts in South East London is an example of a major contract along these lines. We believe the nascent UK accessible market presents attractive opportunities with increased outsourcing from NHS and a growing private clinical laboratory services sector. We are the second largest player in the United Kingdom, with the top two players accounting for approximately 85% of the accessible market in 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The Spanish laboratory services market is expected to be approximately €2.9 billion in 2023 (excluding COVID-19), of which the accessible market for private laboratories is B2C-oriented and amounted to approximately €1.0 billion (roughly 37% of the total market). The accessible market is expected to grow from €1.0 billion in 2023 to €1.1 billion in 2028 at approximately a 1% CAGR with volume growth at a 0– 1% CAGR supported by stable pricing (0% CAGR estimated). This market grew at a 1% CAGR from €1.0 billion in 2019 to €1.0 billion in 2023, tracking the 2015 to 2019 period in which growth was flat. We are the largest player in Spain with the top three players accounting for approximately 20–35% of the accessible market in 2022, leaving room for consolidation. The Portuguese laboratory services market is expected to be approximately €0.7 billion in 2023 (excluding COVID-19), of which the accessible market for private laboratories is B2C-oriented and amounted to approximately €0.4 billion (roughly 57% of the total market). The accessible market is expected to grow from €0.4 billion in 2023 to €0.4 billion in 2028 at approximately a 2% CAGR, with volume growth being the primary driver at a 1–2% CAGR, supported by stable pricing. This market grew at a 1% CAGR from €0.4 billion in 2019 to €0.4 billion in 2023, in line with the 1% CAGR from 0.3 billion in 2015 to €0.4 billion in 2019. We are the fourth largest player in Portugal, with the top three players accounting for approximately 50% of the accessible market in 2022. We see significant opportunities in emerging markets especially in Latin America. The region is characterized by a high degree of fragmentation; Peru and Chile are more than 50% unconsolidated and Brazil and Colombia are 30–40% unconsolidated. Colombia is the main contributor to our Latin American revenue at 60–65%. While Peru has a slightly stronger growth outlook than Colombia, there is notable political instability and foreign currency exchange rate risk. Colombia has been our main market in the Latin American region to-date. In 2023, the Colombian clinical laboratory services market size is approximately €700–750 million. It is estimated that the accessible market in Colombia for private laboratories amounts to €300–320 million in 2023. The Colombian accessible diagnostic laboratory services market is forecasted to grow mid-single digits (4– 5%) from 2023 to 2028 with SYNLAB's underlying market growth likely greater than this given our higher exposure to the faster growing B2B segment in Colombia (5–6%), while B2C is expected to grow at 2–4%. Growth is primarily expected to be driven by volumes (3–4% from 2023 to 2028) with prices broadly flat as a result of private healthcare demand increasing in line with the continued emergence of the uppermiddle class. While the timeline and proposed changes remain unclear, major healthcare reform is anticipated in Colombia with a particular need to harmonize inpatient versus outpatient reimbursements. Current prices are based on 2021 tariffs, with industry leaders expecting discounts likely to be updated in 2023 or 2024. In Colombia and across the region, foreign currency exchange rates and political instability are the key risk factors. The Colombian healthcare system relies on a mandatory public healthcare system, complemented by optional private plans. The public system is a contributive system, which is subsidized if coverage cannot be afforded. Private complementary healthcare includes pre-paid medicine and insurance plans. In 2022, the share of the population with healthcare coverage under the public healthcare system or a private plan was estimated to be approximately 99%. ----- Clinical laboratory services in Colombia are addressed by three main types of players. Integrated (directly operated) in-house hospital laboratories serve the public healthcare system and are non-accessible to private operators. Outsourced (operated by third-party providers) in-hospital laboratories address both the public and private healthcare systems, including privately insured patients that are sent to hospital and in-city laboratories, and are accessible to private operators. Private in-city laboratories serve the pre-paid medicine and insurance plan segments and are accessible to private operators. Continued outsourcing trends have benefited the in-hospital laboratories segment, while the private in-city laboratories segment has benefited from growth in the number of private complementary healthcare insurance clients. The Colombian clinical laboratory services market is relatively consolidated. In 2022, the top three players represented approximately 54—64% of the total market and we are the largest player. Other Latin American markets are instead largely fragmented, with Peru, where we are the number two player and Chile, where more than 50% of the market is unconsolidated.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.4,Competitive Features,18.4.1,Highly Competitive Market with Ongoing Consolidation,"The European clinical laboratory services sector is highly competitive, with portions of the sector that remain fragmented. We expect further cross-border consolidation among certain of our competitors, as well as increased penetration of the European sector by some of the major non-European laboratory groups (including, in particular, Quest Diagnostics, Laboratory Corporation of America and Sonic Healthcare). In the next few years, we expect to see a mix of acquisitions and disposals as players focus further on optimization. As the largest pan-European player by revenue in our sector, present in growing and resilient end markets, we believe we are well positioned to continue to lead such consolidation and improve our competitive position. The portion of the European clinical laboratory services sector that remains fragmented is subject to a combination of factors that in our view make it a prime candidate for consolidation, which could benefit large pan-European players such as us. Those factors include pricing pressure, changing quality standards, increasingly complex and technically demanding tests and the ongoing industrialization of processes in order to generate economies of scale and reduce costs. Consolidation could increase the market share of medium- and large-scale laboratory groups, allowing them to leverage their pre-existing footprint and established levels of expertise and could accelerate the expansion of large competitors in the European market.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Patients who are free to select where they are tested usually base their decision on a laboratory's proximity to their home or workplace. Other clients, mostly doctors, hospitals and other healthcare providers, consider the following factors, among others, in selecting a clinical laboratory: accuracy; timeliness and consistency in reporting test results; reputation of the clinical laboratory in the medical community or field of specialty; quality of advice and medical value added by the laboratory, number and type of tests performed; method of delivering and publishing results; and tools available for interpreting results. Price is also a key factor in the hospital outsourcing market and unregulated sector. On an individual basis, our clinical laboratories compete with independent clinical laboratories, hospitalbased laboratories (both privately and publicly owned) and doctor office laboratories. At a Group level, our laboratories compete with other national, European and international groups.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.4,Competitive Features,18.4.3,"Regional, National, European and Global Clinical Laboratory Groups","European clinical laboratories have been undergoing a process of consolidation over the past three decades. Certain national laboratory groups emerged between 1995 and 2005, such as Labco, Cerba and Biomnis in France, Unilabs in Switzerland, and General Lab and Echevarne in Spain. Since 2006, these groups began consolidating into European groups. Investment funds have also shown an increased interest in the healthcare industry, and more particularly in the clinical laboratory services market. This is likely to continue to accelerate market consolidation and the integration of pan-European groups. Examples include EQT and PSP's investment in Cerba in March 2021 and CDPQ's investment in Biogroup in October 2018. An early example was Apax and Nordic Capital's 2007 investment in Unilabs, which now has a pan-European presence, operating in 16 European countries including France, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal and the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, a number of leading independent national groups remain in Europe, such as, Bianalisi in Italy, Viollier in Switzerland and Echevarne in Spain. In addition, in a number of countries, and in particular in France, there has been an emergence in the recent past of groups organized at a regional level, which are among our main competitors in their particular regional markets. ----- The consolidation in Eastern Europe is increasing with the formation of pan-European groups such as Medicover-Synevo, which is present in eleven countries. Sonic Healthcare, a listed Australian group, is an international player in the clinical laboratory services sector, with operations in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Eurofins Scientific is also among the five largest European players with its presence in twelve countries (with approximately 40–50% of its revenue generated in France).",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.4,Competitive Features,18.4.4,COVID-19 Pandemic,"Clinical diagnostic services market participants, including us, were at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19, having leveraged our scale and agility to react quickly to the evolving market demands and significantly expanded capacities for testing to address the challenges. Market participants, including us, ramped up capacity at existing sites, established COVID-19 centers of excellence, and in some cases built new purpose-built facilities dedicated to SARS-CoV-2 testing. Following the discovery and dissemination of vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 testing peaked in 2021 and has reduced since then. 2022 served as a heterogenous year for COVID-19. It was necessary for clinical laboratory players to work at high intensity during the first quarter given the Omicron wave. We worked hard during this period to deliver the full spectrum of testing including testing based in hospitals to mass testing in schools. Following this period and over the course of 2022, there was a shift to the coexistence with the virus. In 2023, as COVID-19 waned, we have seen the return of ordinary course laboratory testing volumes to pre-COVID19 levels with some backlog captured in 2023 and the remainder expected to be captured by 2024. We believe testing plays a key role and remains a core pillar of national responses for any such future infectious diseases and expect demand for our PCR testing services to be relevant. Increased awareness of testing following the COVID-19 pandemic and focus on prevention, support the acceleration in existing trends.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.4,Competitive Features,18.4.5,Sector Trends and New Market Opportunities,"There are a number of key trends that we expect will impact the clinical laboratory services sector in Europe generally and our business specifically. Because clinical testing is an important healthcare service and due to the key trends discussed below, we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the medium and long term. _Demographics_ We expect that demographic trends and changes in lifestyles will lead to increased demand for, and consequently increased volumes of clinical testing. These trends include the aging population, the increased frequency of soft diseases (such as allergies) and long-term diseases (such as cancer and diabetes) requiring recurring tests, as well as an increased focus on preventive healthcare. Healthcare policies also increasingly recognize the value of early detection and prevention of chronic and severe diseases. The growing emphasis placed on more accurate diagnoses supported by clinical testing has led doctors to increasingly utilize clinical laboratory tests to help identify potential diseases, detect illnesses early, monitor patient compliance, ----- and determine and evaluate treatment. We also believe there will be a growing demand for customized healthcare solutions as well as preventive medicine as a means to reduce costs. Further, we believe that higher disposable income and an increased willingness to absorb out-of-pocket costs could contribute to volume growth. At the same time, the impact of certain lifestyle choices, such as low levels of physical activity, malnutrition and stress, can lead to obesity and related chronic illnesses, which in turn may lead to additional testing. _Pricing Conditions_ In recent years, direct tariff reductions enacted to counterbalance increased volumes and broader health system reforms have placed downward pressure on prices for clinical laboratory services in some countries. Pressure on state budgets has also contributed to reductions in tariffs that can be legally charged for testing as governments and public authorities as well as third-party payers and private insurers have focused on controlling healthcare costs. In certain countries, public reimbursement levels are regularly updated. We expect that efforts to limit the rate of growth in healthcare expenditure will generally result in further reductions in regulated tariffs in the future. While pricing pressure was an integral part of operating in the European clinical laboratory services sector in the past, we have seen sustained positive pricing development especially in South and North & East regions over the last six quarters (especially since COVID-19). Price pressure is higher for automated routine tests than for specialty tests, which mitigates the overall impact of price pressure for companies that offer both routine and specialty testing. In France, a one-off adjustment to the B-letter coefficient was made in 2023 resulting in a blanket price cut of 3.7% to claw-back some of the windfall received during COVID-19 testing. Speculation that regulators could stipulate further steep cuts to reimbursement for the 2024 to 2026 period proved not to be the case. The July 2023 spending budget price cuts for laboratories were lower than expected. The four medical biologists unions and UNCAM agreed on a 0.4% increase in the spending budget for the French health insurance system to laboratories for the period 2024 to 2026. This implies an approximated 2.6% price cut if a 3% growth in volume is assumed in line with the historical period. Regulators typically take a longterm view on the profitability of the sector and ensure smaller market participants are not unduly affected. We have not seen this dynamic in other geographies where market participants are broadly seen as contributing to the overall healthcare system. _Subcontracting and Outsourcing_ Subcontracting and outsourcing by public and private hospital laboratories to the benefit of private organizations is another trend observed in the European clinical laboratory services sector over the last few years, driven in particular by hospital operators' desire for productivity gains. We believe subcontracting and outsourcing will potentially represent a growing source of income for us and similarly situated groups. This trend is not uniformly present in all European countries. It is currently most prevalent in Germany and Spain, especially in the private hospital sector and with hospitals run by churches or trusts. In the United Kingdom, NHS hospitals, faced with tight budget restrictions, are increasingly outsourcing their clinical laboratory services to private groups. Our partnership agreement with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in the United Kingdom exemplifies this trend well. The contract for the provision of pathology services to both trusts was won in 2020 with a duration spanning over 15 years with the option to extend for a further five years. This joint venture facilitates the opportunity to grow further by winning additional contracts with NHS trusts in the surrounding area and enhancing our reputation in order to win tenders elsewhere in the United Kingdom. _Integration and Streamlining of Laboratory Workflows_ Growing demand for increased efficiency and electronic delivery of laboratory data continue to drive integration, automation and process improvement within the clinical laboratory services market. Clinical laboratory service providers continue to automate patient service workflows and laboratory processing in addition to further integrating patient health records and expanding online access to test results. ----- _Precision Medicine_ Medical practice has entered a period of profound change, moving from curative medicine to precision medicine that is personalized, predictive, preventive and participatory. Precision medicine involves the customization of medical decisions and treatments as well as products individually tailored to patients. Clinical laboratory testing will play a key role in the development of precision medicine as therapies rely on biomarkers and require regular testing. The acceleration in the development of precision medicine has been made possible by profound changes in biological and medical research which have opened the way to a considerable expansion of the application of clinical testing in diagnostics. In addition, new opportunities in prevention and in the efficient targeting of treatments should create significant cost savings for healthcare systems, on a scale that would affect the selection of policies that accelerate the expansion of diagnostic activities. This transformation has been driven by the development of new techniques that give access to a substantial amount of data on individuals. Progress in DNA sequencing has had a particularly meaningful impact and has become the main driver of the development of molecular diagnostics. The methods available have diversified, with polymerase chain reaction and high-speed next generation sequencing, which allow for more targeted testing and analysis, including the sequencing of an entire genome, at a considerably quicker pace and at a lower cost. We expect to witness an increase in the demand for and use of sequencing in medical diagnostics. Technical progress in sequencing is moving along with a better understanding of biological mechanisms. For instance, based on the observation that fragments of fetal DNA circulate freely in maternal blood during pregnancy, progress in sequencing has made it possible to develop non-invasive prenatal tests for Down's Syndrome using maternal blood. We believe that a number of other genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy, may be able to be detected through molecular biology from a sample of maternal blood. Similarly, it is now possible to identify the genetic changes that make tumors malignant, through analysis of the tumor genome, allowing for a greater role for clinical testing in the field of oncology. More generally, these developments in molecular biology, combined with the identification of new biomarkers for different diseases, as well as new tests for allergies and nutritional biology, are likely to lead to an expansion of the portfolio of tests carried out in our most sophisticated laboratories. The market for precision medicine is projected to grow from €3 billion in 2023 to approximately €5 billion in 2028 at an 11% CAGR. _Direct-to-Consumer_ The diagnostic testing services market has experienced a growing trend for patients to take control of their own health, which creates new market opportunities for D2C services for the increasing use of diagnostics to measure a number of metrics. The D2C trend includes not only lifestyle monitoring and prevention, such as physical well-being, cardiovascular health and fertility, but also includes self-administered testing for infectious diseases such as HIV or COVID-19, and at-home tests for detecting the use of drugs and alcohol. Players today are focused on web-shop, providing strong online support/services to ensure good customer experience and journey. On the back of these drivers, the European D2C market is expected to grow from less than €1 billion in 2019 to approximately €4 billion in 2028 at a 32% CAGR, materially ahead of the B2B and B2C market. _Digital, AI and Data Services_ Digital transformation is beginning to impact the diagnostic testing market and create new market opportunities relating to services, including digital offerings, such as virtual consultations with medical professionals with AI-driven triage, diagnosis and referral. In addition, machine learning is being used to analyze biological data sets and support clinical decision making, and AI-driven holistic data integration of medical data sets can be used in drug development. The digital, AI and data services market is projected to grow from approximately €1 billion in 2023 to €2.5 billion in 2028 at approximately a 20% CAGR. _Point-of-Care Testing_ While point-of-care testing is expected to grow, with physicians performing selected laboratory tests in their practices, especially those where rapid results are required, a vast majority of tests do not need to be ----- done on an urgent basis require time from physicians and/or need significant specialization. The test cost structure at a physician's practice cannot compete with central laboratories. Point-of-care testing market is projected to grow from €7 billion in 2023 to €12 billion in 2028 at approximately an 11% CAGR. We expect large market participants, including us, to develop cost-effective point-of-care testing solutions via partnerships in high-growth market sub-segments and geographies (e.g., the United Kingdom, France and Germany). _Quality Standards_ Changes in quality standards are also shaping the clinical laboratory services market. We expect that the quality standards applicable to the sector, although varying from one country to another, are likely to become increasingly restrictive in the coming years. Compliance with applicable national-level regulations, accreditation or certification standards and the requirements of standard-setting bodies are not only necessary for the continued operation of laboratories but also, in certain markets, a prerequisite for selection as a contractual partner with health insurance providers or hospitals and clinics. Maintaining high quality standards and meeting increasingly stringent accreditation requirements is costly and time consuming and may force smaller laboratories and laboratory networks to merge or consolidate in the future. For example, French legislation now requires that all clinical laboratories should have undertaken a quality accreditation process and it is likely that other European countries will follow suit. In view of the resources required to implement these quality standards, many small- and medium-sized independent laboratories could be tempted to join a network offering a quality control department and dedicated teams.

504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.8,Our Competitive Strengths,18.8.1,"We operate in the large, resilient and growing clinical laboratory services market, which has advantages for established market participants and is supported by strong non-cyclical growth trends that have been accelerated by COVID-19-pandemic tailwinds.","Our core markets have grown materially throughout the last decade and have proven resilient to economic cycles. The market is also expected to continue to benefit from favorable demographic factors, such as an aging population, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases as well as an increasing propensity of public healthcare providers to outsource diagnostic services to private sector companies, a shortage of experts and ----- personnel specifically in molecular biology, genetics and pathology, a growing focus on disease prevention, increasing outsourcing of clinical laboratory testing by hospitals, a growing market for D2C services, precision medicine and digital, AI and data services, the monetization of healthcare data and an increasing demand for fast servicing in specialized diagnostics. These are expected to be key growth drivers for the future. Medical diagnostics services are an essential part of the medical value chain, with approximately 70% of medical decisions based on laboratory results. The medical diagnostic testing market we address today is large, resilient and is expected to grow from a market value of approximately €28 billion in 2023 to approximately €34 billion by 2028, growing at an approximately 3–4% CAGR. The medical diagnostics market in our core European countries (France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) is expected to grow at approximately a 2% CAGR from 2023 to 2028. Our established leadership position and reputation as a high quality provider in the medical diagnostics market affords us certain advantages that put us in prime position to grow with the market, which include: (i) economies of scale: significant benefits derived from experience in longer test series infrastructure (lower fixed cost per test) due to scale benefits in overhead and logistics; (ii) increasing regulation: established players are better equipped to deal with strict quality certification regimes, accreditation and guarantor requirements that create financial hurdles that are burdensome for smaller, or independent operators; (iii) know-how: large players are best positioned to acquire and retain skilled medical staff and specialists; (iv) reputation: the build-up of reputation as a reliable, high-quality service provider is time-consuming for new entrants (e.g., building up a referral network) resulting in a competitive advantage for established players; and (v) the _contractual nature of the B2B market: with excellence built into our services and strong relationships with_ physicians in the B2B market and NHS contracts, such as our Synnovis partnership agreement with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in South East London, we are well entrenched as incumbents with a strong knowledge of the hospital or provider situation. In addition to resilient market fundamentals, COVID-19 provided a strong tailwind to the diagnostic testing market during the pandemic and a testament to the counter-cyclical nature of the industry. While COVID19-related testing levels have now subsided and normalized, the industry is now benefitting from an increased focus on awareness and disease prevention. This is driving innovation on the provider side and is increasing access to diagnostic services across the globe, which is expected to continue to sustain volume growth in the long term. In addition, the temporary revenue increases resulting from SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-19-related services have allowed us to invest in our underlying business and ensure that our core services are well-funded going forward. Finally, the medical diagnostic services markets we serve are highly competitive and remain largely fragmented, providing significant opportunities for larger players like us to continue to consolidate the industry, entering new markets and reinforcing presence in existing markets. We believe that consolidation of the clinical laboratory testing market will allow large international laboratory consolidators like us, which benefit from high testing volumes across geographic markets, to further expand regional laboratory clusters, improve efficiency and decrease overall costs.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.8,Our Competitive Strengths,18.8.2,"We are a global player in the medical diagnostics space and the market leader in Europe by revenue with comprehensive capabilities across a broad range of routine and specialty testing services and are well- diversified across geographies, channels and payers.","We are the largest clinical laboratory services company by revenue in Europe. Our revenue of €3,250.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 25% greater than that of the second largest player in Europe and, like us, that player is estimated to have generated around one-quarter of its 2022 revenue from COVID-19-related services. We are present in all three of the largest EU markets by nominal GDP (i.e., France, Germany and Italy) and in the United Kingdom. We are one of the leaders in each of these four countries, which we consider our core markets, as well as in other geographies. In addition, we have established a strong presence in high-growth emerging markets across Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. In total, we are present in 33 countries across five continents. We have achieved leading positions in more than 20 countries, representing a significant proportion of the countries in which we operate. We draw numerous tangible scale benefits from our wide geographic footprint, leadership position in local markets and full range of services. These include: the ability to offer more competitive contractual terms to ----- customers; enhanced procurement power; the ability to consolidate and automate procedures; the knowledge and resources to create new capabilities (e.g., in retail or hospital settings); the critical mass to build an integrated IT infrastructure; and the expertise to capitalize on opportunities for large-scale data analytics. Scale is a critical differentiator driving costs down and creating a competitive advantage compared to local and regional players. We bring deep understanding of different market needs across the B2B, B2C and D2C business models, adapting our services to local requirements to enhance patient experiences. This commercial and operational flexibility is a key enabler of our new business generation, customer and payer diversification and new market entry. We are well-diversified across the channels, with B2B contributing approximately 60% of our revenue and the remaining approximately 40% coming from B2C and D2C channels. Our strong reputation, market position and proven expertise and presence across all testing categories, enable us to attract and retain industry-leading medical experts and qualified specialists. As a result, we have cultivated a wide network of medical experts, significantly enhancing our medical capabilities and ability to innovate. Through close collaboration with research departments from universities and the pharmaceutical industry, we continuously enhance our diagnostic offering. Furthermore, we have accumulated vast expertise through our operational scale and global presence, which we leverage across markets. Our business also benefits from a wide payer base, including statutory and private insurance, hospital systems, individual clinics and out-of-pocket spending. Our pan-European presence and expertise across payer groups allows us to draw on our experience and know-how while entering new markets, adapt quickly to local conditions and create value. All of the above factors contribute to our well-balanced portfolio across business models, enabling us to serve across different markets. This also ensures diversification across geographies, channels, nature of contracts and types of tests, offering inherent stability and not materially exposing us to any single customer or market segment.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.8,Our Competitive Strengths,18.8.3,Our customer-centric strategy is aimed at delivering above-market growth and is based on medical and operational excellence and highly skilled employees.,"Our strategy of customer-centric medical excellence has yielded tangible results, including unlocking additional organic revenue growth by providing a superior patient and clinician experience. We are capable of delivering a highly customized end-to-end customer journey that includes registration, sampling, diagnostics, reporting and consultation. We operate an efficient hub-and-spoke network of laboratories (including approximately 30 ""hub"" European reference laboratories and central laboratories and 420 ""spoke"" medical laboratories). Our ""hub"" laboratories consist of two European reference laboratories (near Stuttgart, Germany and near Barcelona, Spain) and additional central laboratories in all of our major countries, all of which perform specialty testing services on samples provided from other network laboratories. In addition, our ""spoke"" laboratories, which include regional laboratories, satellite laboratories and emergency laboratories, together with our point-ofcare testing capabilities, make up the backbone of our efficient hub-and-spoke model. Our ""centers of excellence"" located across our laboratory network deliver medical expertise for certain medical areas and have specialist diagnostic competencies. Through our laboratory network, we are able to offer a wide range of analytical and diagnostic testing services, conducting over 600 million tests per year, including more than 5,000 routine testing services in the field of clinical testing; genetic and anatomic pathology testing of both histological and cytological samples; and diagnostic imaging. In the year ended December 31, 2022, our routine testing services provided approximately two-thirds of our revenue, while our specialty testing services and our other services (e.g., anatomic pathology, examinations, genetics and imaging) each represented approximately one-sixth of our revenue. We offer a tailored approach to prescribers and focus on retail management capabilities. Our business has a broad retail base with millions of patients and a large prescriber customer base. We develop innovative products and provide value-added solutions to hospitals, dialysis centers, polyclinics, outpatient clinics, laboratories and others via a variety of business models including point-of-care, management and supply, outsourcing, joint ventures and consulting services. We adapt our business models (B2B, B2C or D2C) to suit customer requirements, for example, by providing only certain specialty tests, entire laboratory ----- outsourcing services or special consultancy services as necessary to meet the specific needs of our customers. This adaptability is one of our core strengths and is a testament to our customer-centric strategy. Medical excellence is at the core of our business. We offer a full spectrum of approximately 5,000 different testing services ranging from routine to highly specialized (including genetics, anatomic pathology, radiology and nuclear medicine) and we have established ourselves as the top European player in anatomic pathology and genetics. Our genetic testing capabilities include full exome sequencing, large gene panels and single genetic variants. We also have capabilities covering all anatomic pathology sub-specialties. We benefit from the shared medical knowledge of over 2,000 doctors and specialists and partnerships with leading medical universities, which have fostered innovation and contributed to 368 medical publications by SYNLAB scientists in 2022. In addition, we have built a large and highly integrated platform of laboratories on a global scale with a network of over 450 laboratories across 33 countries. This scale at global level creates unique advantages by allowing us to centralize administrative functions and reduce costs. We also leverage our experience across different countries to use the most optimal strategy for entry into new markets, addressing that market's unique structure and allowing us to drive above-market growth and efficient integration. Our extensive B2B operations, serving hospitals and physicians (e.g., in Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom), account for around 60% of our revenue. We deploy a variety of strategies including systematic campaigning by country to prescribers, developing demand management tools for clinicians and hospitals and delivering high-end medical capabilities, reinforcing our medical leadership reputation. Our global laboratory network and understanding of market segmentation positions us for rapid and professional expansion in attractive new markets and enhanced ability to estimate and realize synergies when acquisitions are made in new geographies. We also provide D2C operations focused on prevention and wellness that are paid out-of-pocket in Italy, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, France and Hungary. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated our unique medical, operational and commercial capabilities. We partnered with national healthcare systems and governments from the outset of the pandemic to develop tests and procedures, leveraging our innovation expertise and securing supply chains early to rapidly roll out testing internationally. This strengthened our position as a trusted medical partner and adviser globally and allowed us to win contracts with businesses, educational institutions and sports associations to safely get employees back to work, students back to school and athletes back on the playing field. Our customer-centric strategy has resulted in above-market growth in our key markets. For example, over the period from 2019 through 2023, our B2B business in Germany and the United Kingdom and our B2C business in France and Italy all grew at CAGRs exceeding the market CAGRs for the same period. Our German and UK B2B businesses generated revenue CAGRs of approximately 5% and 6%, respectively, while the underlying markets grew at approximately 2% and 5%, respectively (in each case, excluding SARS-CoV-2 testing revenue). Similarly, our French and Italian B2C businesses generated revenue CAGRs of approximately 2% and 6%, respectively, ahead of underlying market growths of approximately 1% and 3%, respectively (in each case, excluding SARS-CoV-2 testing revenue), over the period.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.8,Our Competitive Strengths,18.8.4,"We have a strong financial profile, with profitability accelerating through robust organic growth, operational efficiencies, a disciplined approach to capital allocation and solid cash generation.","We have consistently demonstrated solid growth, increasing our total revenue by a CAGR of 11.3% between 2012 and 2022 (or 8.3% when excluding COVID-19-related revenue). We have largely exceeded long-term revenue growth guidance of 3%, recently having posted 5.1% growth between January 1, 2022 and September 30, 2023 (consisting of 1.6% of pricing growth and 3.5% of volume growth). During the COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrated outstanding revenue growth, largely driven by our ability to capitalize on the SARS-CoV-2 testing opportunity and adapt to the changing macroeconomic environment. Between 2020 and 2022, our total COVID-19-related revenue was approximately €3.0 billion, with €618.0 million of COVID-19-related revenue in 2020, €1,579.0 million in 2021 and €€789.0 million in 2022. Over the same period our Adjusted EBITDA Margin averaged 27.1% and our Cash Conversion averaged 84.5%. While our COVID-19-related revenue declined in 2022 from its peak in 2021, our base revenue from our core business (excluding COVID-19-related revenue) posted 6.2% year-on-year revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2022, as a result of positive volume developments in routine (excluding SARS-CoV ----- 2) and specialty testing as well as positive price impacts driven by price indexation to inflation in certain regions while experiencing reimbursement reduction in others. Overall, revenue for our core business (excluding COVID-19-related revenue) grew at a 7.8% CAGR from €1,807.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to approximately €2,584.1 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we delivered organic revenue growth of 6.9% year-on-year (excluding COVID-19-related revenue), of which 5.4% was a result of increased volumes and the remaining 1.5% was a result of price growth. We expect our long-term revenue development to continue to be supported by favorable structural growth trends and benefit from our various retail initiatives, such as opening new blood collection points, strengthening our testing portfolios and D2C initiatives. During the period from 2020 through 2022, our Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased significantly from historic levels to 25.9% in 2020, 32.1% in 2021 and 23.2% in 2022, primarily as a result of the shift in business mix towards significantly higher margin SARS-CoV-2 testing. As illustrated below, our quarterly Adjusted EBITDA Margin declined through 2022 and has stabilized in 2023, albeit at a level that is below that seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating a clear path for further improvement. From 2022 through 2023 to date, COVID-19-related earnings have subsided significantly and our Adjusted EBITDA Margin declined to 16.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was also partially an outcome of the higher inflationary environment. We believe both SARS-CoV-2 testing, which has been impacting our business mix, and the current high inflation levels, which are impacting our personnel and operating expenses, are temporary factors that are affecting our business in the short term but are expected to normalize over the medium term. We expect 2023 to continue to be a year of normalization, with margins stabilizing as we refocus the business on core fundamentals. Going forward, we expect margin recovery to occur as a result of (i) nearterm factors, such as the elimination of costs incurred as a publicly listed company that are not expected to be incurred under private ownership and savings from the elimination of COVID-19-related personnel costs and (ii) mid-term broader cost optimization as we continue to focus on cost base improvements through the SALIX program. In addition, we expect further margin uplifts to result from operating as a private company following the Acquisition and from a ramp-up in the profitability of our Synnovis partnership in South East London with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, which is a 15-year contract that began in 2021. Although this contract was initially margin dilutive, it is expected to become accretive in the near term as we roll out a new centralized platform to replace the existing hospital laboratory systems. We have a solid track-record of driving operational improvements and Adjusted EBITDA Margin expansion through several cost savings initiatives, particularly SALIX, our leading operational excellence program introduced in 2017. SALIX is executed locally, but systematically tracked centrally on an ongoing basis. SALIX is broadly categorized between material expenses, personnel expenses and operating expenses, focused on procurement efficiencies, headcount efficiencies, digitalization, automation and our laboratory footprint. Historically, we have delivered €20–25 million in cost savings each year across the SALIX program since inception and approximately €140 million since inception. In 2022, SALIX generated approximately €25 million in total savings helping to partially offset the change in business mix and inflationary pressure, with further ongoing savings expected over the medium term, including ----- €45 million estimated for the year ending December 31, 2023, €30 million of which was delivered in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition to these cost savings, we have also generated savings on personnel costs through the reduction and ultimate elimination of headcount specifically allocated to COVID-19-related functions. As full-time capabilities related to COVID-19 are no longer driving significant revenue production as they did in 2021 and 2022, we have recalibrated our focus on allocating personnel in accordance with our underlying core business. Since mid-2023, we have not had any personnel specifically employed for COVID-19-related functions, which is down from 3,500 employees at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have maintained our 2023 outlook and are on track to deliver on our €2.7 billion revenue guidance (including greater than 4% organic growth), with 74% (€1,989.9 million) of 2023 revenue guidance having been achieved in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (or €1,924.0 million after taking into account acquisitions and disposals that occurred during the period). We also expect to reach our 16–18% Adjusted EBITDA Margin guidance for 2023 and continue on our path to margin expansion in the long term on the back of (i) stable volume growth, supported by geographical densification, improving operational and logistical efficiency with a positive impact on profitability as well as positive impact from changing business activity mix, with a view towards higher margin testing products in key geographies and (ii) productivity gains, including the continued impact of our initiatives such as digitalization, laboratory footprint optimization, the STS discussed below, headcount efficiencies and automation. Reduced cost inflation, net of prices increases, could further result in a tailwind and tangible lever to our future organic margin expansion. Our strong track record of accretive acquisitions and synergies extraction, coupled with active portfolio management at all levels, is also expected to positively contribute to our long-term profitability development. Finally, our business benefits from relatively low levels of working capital and net capital expenditure, which comprises acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets net of disposals of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Due to our favorable business model, we are able to generate strong cash flow despite the temporary macro-economic headwinds described above, generating the capacity to de-lever while continuing to support our prudent acquisition strategy. Our Cash Conversion (excluding non-recurring capital expenditures of €11 million in 2021, €34 million in 2022 and €50 million the first nine months of 2023 related to the contract ramp-up of our Synnovis partnership agreement with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in South East London) was 89% in the year ended December 31, 2021, 84% in the year ended December 31, 2022 and 72% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Consolidation of the market is driven by the introduction of new regulation, increased pressure on margins, mandatory accreditations that increase costs for smaller players or individual laboratories, aging biologists close to retirement looking for an exit and the ability to compete against scaled players. With large parts of the market remaining unconsolidated, we have significant runway to further consolidate the market in our key regions. Since the formation of the SYNLAB Group in the second half of 2015 through the first threequarters of 2023, we completed 159 acquisitions (excluding additional acquisitions in business units that were sold during that period). While there is significant growth and consolidation potential remaining in the market and we believe we are well-positioned to continue to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves, our M&A strategy is, and will, continue to be disciplined; it is fully aligned to our core strengths and additive to our organic growth levers. We have well-established processes and structures in place that allow us to evaluate and steer our targets from identification to due diligence and acquisition and on to the post-merger integration. These processes with clear criteria for M&A are at the core of our disciplined approach to acquisitions. The plans for postmerger integration that are drawn up ahead of an acquisition and diligent execution thereof give us the confidence that the expected value creation and deleveraging through synergies are aligned and achievable. ----- We benefit from a dedicated team focused on finding, evaluating and executing external growth opportunities. We have developed a structured approach to acquisitions that capitalizes on the expertise and market knowledge of both our management and local laboratory doctors. Our management team has a strong track record of executing buy-and-build strategies through targeted acquisitions and the integration of laboratories into group operations. We have consistently expanded our laboratory networks through acquisitions. We have a clear track-record of implementing operational efficiencies to realize synergies, cost savings and drive improvements to gross and operating margins. Our size allows us to efficiently integrate and optimize laboratory operations, procurement functions and production processes through the identification of best practices and improving our information technology platforms. This includes our ability to extract advantageous procurement conditions with our suppliers, in particular through our Group-wide panEuropean framework supply agreements for reagents, calibrators, quality controls and automates. After acquiring clinical laboratories, we also implement efficiency measures aimed at increasing profitability leveraging the application of relevant best practices from across our network. We are also focused on optimization through a dynamic portfolio management strategy where we have divested certain businesses, with a focus on either (i) lower-margin businesses and geographies or (ii) selling assets where accretive multiples are achievable and using the proceeds to de-lever or reinvest in efficient operations. As part of this strategy, in July 2023, we completed the sale of our Swiss business, which had been dilutive to margins in recent years, allowing us to reduce our net debt by approximately €154 million, and, in September 2023, we completed the sale of our veterinary business in Belgium, Germany and Spain, disposing of a non-core business that accounted for less than 1% of our total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2022, resulting in net proceeds of approximately €194 million.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

We will continue to leverage our reputation to reinforce the public perception of the quality and breadth of our services, to attract new customers as well as skilled medical staff, particularly doctors and other primary care physicians. We have committed to a strategy of medical expertise and scientific leadership based on the highest standards of quality, ethics and reliability. We aim to continuously invest in our facilities, technologies and scientists. We plan to maintain and reinforce our ""centers of excellence"" culture across our laboratory network, not only within larger European reference laboratories and central laboratories but also in smaller ones. We also intend to further develop our medical expertise by ensuring that all our laboratories continue to be fully accredited in accordance with the highest local standards and by maintaining industry leadership in self-regulation, governance and participation in pan-European scientific committees. The voice of our experts is increasingly heard in all of the healthcare systems we work with and we aim to increase this active participation in the medical discussions of the topics of our time, as evidenced during the COVID19 pandemic. We also remain alert to changing trends in testing patterns and continue to introduce new tests that position us at the forefront of the medical diagnostics field. Leveraging this medical expertise, we will continue providing customers with accurate test results with the highest possible medical precision, the shortest possible turnaround time and the lowest possible analysis error rate. Customer experience is also enhanced via additional services (e.g., counselling services pre- and post-test). In addition to this, we will also continue to roll out ""SYNLAB Access,"" an intuitive digitalized tool with a focus on enhancing the patient journey. As some healthcare systems are coming under significant budgetary pressures, public and private hospitals, organizations and other healthcare providers are seeking to improve the productivity and the medical quality of their services by outsourcing inefficient and sub-scale laboratory activities to diagnostics experts. We are well-placed to take advantage of this trend as we can provide a full spectrum of outsourcing solutions, ranging from referral testing services to full outsourcing with the transfer of entire teams and assets, most notably in France, Finland, Germany, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. For example, we have been entrusted with the largest hospital outsourcing contract ever granted in the United Kingdom; the Synnovis partnership in South East London with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. This project aims to deliver a capital efficient service modernization program with leading service digitalization, implementing digital pathology, allowing access to our global clinical network, driving reduction of laboratory estates and cost of testing. This experience and track record positions us well as more hospital systems consider outsourcing. Under the growth initiatives program ""For You,"" we systematically implement campaigns in each country and enhance sales force effectiveness with prescribers, develop connectivity with clinicians and tools for demand management. We also continuously reinforce our medical leadership, reputation and establish clinical partnerships. At the same time, we continually increase the number of specialty tests in order to provide a broader service offering across our network, for example by continuing to identify and introducing testing services in various geographies and therefore creating a consistent and increasing panEuropean products and services offering driving further growth. We also invest significantly in selected areas, such as patient and doctor interfaces to increase client-base proximity and in AI technologies to enhance customer service and satisfaction propositions. Moreover, we have launched our D2C proposition focusing on prevention and wellness. Leveraging our extensive experience in running a web shop in Estonia that we have operated since 2017, pilot D2C projects were launched in the United Kingdom and Italy in 2022 and subsequently expanded to Portugal, Spain, France and Hungary. We expect this market to evolve and capture a growing share of the medical diagnostics market. ----- We are also focused on leveraging our scientific and operational know-how to deliver our sophisticated propositions in higher growth emerging markets, mainly with respect to Latin America (including Colombia, Mexico, Chile and Peru) and Africa (Nigeria and Ghana).",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.9,Our Strategy,18.9.2,"We will sustain our focus on innovation and operational excellence by leveraging our scale, capabilities and supplier relationships to drive operating efficiencies and profitability.","We utilize technological innovations like state-of-the-art software, AI and digitalization to further improve our diagnostic service processes and simplify our business. For example, our implementation of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) simplifies our reporting formats and addresses audit regulations. Similarly, digitalization in diagnostic services enables us to support the work of our colleagues and employees. This also helps us work efficiently with physicians and improves how they deliver treatment and medical care. We have also established a team that will leverage AI to refine our customer solutions offering, based on our proprietary data, which will further help us pioneer new opportunities. Our strategy is to focus on providing decision support through rule-based annotation support, develop demand control tools and enable virtual consultation by means of digital communication. This not only positions us to deliver stronger customer experience but also reduces costs by leveraging technology and improving operations. We intend to continue leveraging our extensive network to streamline our laboratory operations and administrative functions and to strengthen our post-merger integration processes and capabilities while enhancing our service offering. In doing so, we aim to continue reducing our operating costs through operational efficiency improvements across our laboratory network and the optimization of procurement contracts at lower costs. This is captured under our SALIX program, which is focused on regaining preCOVID-19 pandemic productivity and is driven by implementing identified global initiatives including procurement contracts, targeted COVID-19 employee and other personnel reductions, supply chain management, process standardization and digitalization. SALIX is underpinned by three key pillars. The first pillar is procurement (captured under material expenditure). We seek to leverage our scale to save on direct and indirect costs, thereby reducing materials costs and operating expenses. The second pillar is the STS which is based on Lean Six Sigma principles (automation, workspace design, planning and scheduling, multi-skilled workforce, standardization, performance management). STS is a management system supporting our strategy and is considered the engine driving us to operational excellence by enabling customer centricity, productivity increases and a healthy organization. STS also has the effect of reducing operating (captured under operational expenditure) and personnel expenses (captured under personnel expenditure). All cost savings from STS are transferred into SALIX. The third pillar is focused on our laboratory network, including refining our ""hub"" and ""spoke"" network, ensuring it has superior logistics and reliable technical service and maintenance functions. This pillar also has the effect of reducing operating and personnel expenses. In 2022, SALIX generated cost savings of €25 million, with savings of material expenses accounting for 42%, personnel expenses for 22% and operational expenses for 35%. In addition, we are focused on network optimization, especially in areas with limited density of blood collection points, which impacts margins. We actively manage our blood collection point network either by opening or refurbishing existing blood collection points or acquiring blood collection points locally to expand our reach and extend our scale. Within blood collection points, we are rolling out the STS across the platform, resulting in lower waiting times, improved NPS scores and increasing revenue from out-ofpocket services.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.9,Our Strategy,18.9.3,We will develop our talent by empowering and engaging our employees.,"To deliver a best-in-class service for our patients and customers, we rely on committed and qualified people. Employees are the interface to patients and customers and are critical to our success. Employee engagement, with the objective of driving enhanced organizational performance, is a key pillar of our strategy. This effort is reflected in three Group-wide initiatives: (i) the SYNLAB Leadership Model (ACCE), (ii) the SYNLAB Campus and (iii) SYNLAB Dialogue. The SYNLAB Leadership Model (ACCE) is a proprietary model of leadership training that aims to align individual management actions to the principles and values shared within the company. The SYNLAB Campus is one of the core platforms for people development, focused on creating a new way of working based on a culture of collaboration and reflecting our values of passion, accountability and customer centricity. SYNLAB Campus provides ----- professional development courses and training to enhance personal and professional effectiveness, as well as further Group-level initiatives. SYNLAB Dialogue is a Group-wide annual survey that gives employees an opportunity to anonymously share their views with the organization and is intended to serve as a base for improving our human capital and driving continuous improvements to continue to be recognized as a great place to work. In addition, our human resources strategy is also focused on establishing successful talent and succession management programs, establishing an environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") company culture that demonstrates commitment to corporate social responsibility and sustainability and enables clear performance management processes throughout the organization. Other programs implemented include acknowledgement of employee contributions (e.g., by offering medical awards and research grants), dual education opportunities and the creation of a work environment that minimizes the risk of accidents. We have a strong focus on ESG with a dedicated board committee monitoring the progress of our ESG strategy. It is based on three pillars, SYNLAB Green, SYNLAB Care and SYNLAB Citizenship. Our new central laboratories including our Synnovis partnership agreement with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in South East London, our new central laboratory in Munich, Germany and ongoing construction of a new medical center in Florence, Italy adhere to the highest ESG standards.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.9,Our Strategy,18.9.4,"We will pursue growth and profitability opportunities through efficient capital allocation, investments in our business and selective acquisitions / divestments in current and new markets.","We operate a highly cash generative model, with a major focus on accounts receivable and managing capital expenditure efficiently. Ensuring capital is efficiently allocated to facilitate growth opportunities is critical. From 2018 through 2022, we invested around €110 million per year on average in targeted infrastructure developments to support our operational excellence strategy. Infrastructure investments typically include new blood collection points and commercial activities, logistics infrastructure, diagnostic centers, improvements in existing laboratory and blood collection point facilities, laboratory equipment, customer interaction and end-user service platforms, as well as back office and IT. In 2021, beyond the normal investments in our core activities and in further response to the COVID-19 pandemic, significant investments were made to set up appropriate SARS-CoV-2 testing capabilities across the network. These investments position us well for the medium term, with fewer one-off capital expenditures expected and better control over leases expansion going forward. We also benefit from a prudent and disciplined external growth strategy, focused on a balanced and lower, as compared to previous years, annual spend in the medium term (approximately €75 million investment on M&A as of September 30, 2023, in line with our planned reduction in 2023 from levels of M&A spending in prior years) and increased focus on accretive bolt-on acquisitions as opposed to transformative and large-scale deals, with tangible scope to generate operational efficiencies and synergies. Our ability to integrate these acquisitions and extract cost savings are a key contributor to our profitability. We are typically able to realize synergies within 12–24 months from acquisition, primarily by optimizing costs through group level advantages in procurement and other functions and through streamlining personnel expenses, leveraging group supplier contracts and existing group and regional support functions. We also have a disciplined approach to entry price, focusing on post-synergies valuations of approximately 9-12x EBITDA. Given our strong cash flow performance, we can generally self-finance planned acquisitions, mostly made up of highly accretive bolt-on acquisitions. Generally, we see ourselves in a strong financial position to continue consolidating the market and creating value from our own resources. In 2023, we have temporarily reduced our M&A spending from historic levels to fully focus the business on achieving the same productivity level as before the COVID-19 pandemic. Separately, we have an active portfolio management strategy. We continuously monitor performance at the level of countries, segments, entity, contract or customer groups, with a reinforced focus on countries or segments with low margins (less than 10% Adjusted EBITDA Margin), divesting lower performing assets or assets that can be sold at highly accretive multiples. We evaluate market structure, degree of consolidation, critical scale required in the market, organic growth of laboratory testing services in the ----- country and reimbursement and regulation trends. While the most immediate focus is on assets with Adjusted EBITDA Margins below 10%, we also aim to decrease the revenue contribution of businesses with margins below 20% (which contributed approximately 52% of our revenue in the first half of 2023) and look for opportunities to simplify our business model. The completed sale of our veterinary diagnostics business in Belgium, Germany and Spain in September 2023 and of our business operations in Switzerland in July 2023, are outcomes of such evaluation. These businesses were sold for attractive multiples and were margin accretive for the whole Group, with cash inflow from the sale of subsidiaries, net of cash disposed and changes in debt having amounted to €346 million. The proceeds have been reinvested and utilized for the purposes of deleveraging (including repaying in full €220 million of term loan B debt under a facility that was outstanding at the time in July 2023).",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.10,Our History,18.10.1,,"The SYNLAB Group, as it is currently constituted, was formed when Labco and SYNLAB were acquired by Cinven (as majority shareholder) and its co-investors in 2015. These businesses were subsequently integrated as a single group under the SYNLAB name. SYNLAB was founded in 1998 by Dr. Bartl Wimmer by combining four laboratories in Germany. Since its inception, SYNLAB has continued to develop its expertise in routine and specialty laboratory testing, consistently expanding its presence and services through acquisitions in Germany and abroad. Labco was founded in France in 2004, operating a strong network of routine and specialist laboratories and over 1,000 collection centers across seven European countries. We completed our initial public offering and subsequent admission to listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on April 27, 2021 in order to gain access to capital markets and reduce our leverage. As a result of a capital increase in kind, by contributing the shares of SYNLAB Limited into SYNLAB AG, SYNLAB AG became the parent company of the Group. We have been listed on the Prime Standard of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange since April 30, 2021. Built as the combination of two large businesses, we have a successful track record of sector consolidation. From the formation of the SYNLAB Group in October 2015 through September 30, 2023, we completed 159 acquisitions of laboratories. In 2020, we disposed of our Analytics & Services (""A&S"") business to fully focus on expanding our core human medicine activities. In July 2023, we completed the sale of all of our Swiss entities to Sonic Healthcare as part of a strategic decision. In 2022, we finalized the sale of our UK veterinary diagnostic business and in September 2023, we completed the sale of the remainder of our veterinary diagnostics businesses in Belgium, Germany and Spain to Mars Incorporated. In March 2023, Cinven announced its preliminary intention to launch an acquisition offer for SYNLAB AG and on September 29, 2023, Cinven announced the decision to launch the Acquisition Offer (See ""The _Transactions—The Acquisition—The Acquisition Offer"")._",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.11,Services,18.11.1,Human Medicine Diagnostics,"Human medicine diagnostics are the primary focus of our business operations and are offered across our entire network of laboratories in each of the countries in which we operate. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, revenue from human medicine diagnostics amounted to €1,936.8 million, or 97.3% of our total revenue. Our human medicine diagnostics can broadly be divided into routine and specialty testing services and also include examination and imaging. We estimate that routine testing represents approximately two-thirds of our testing activity, with specialty testing and examination and imaging collectively representing approximately one-third of testing activity. In addition, in 2020 we began providing SARS-CoV-2 tests. We performed 35.3 million SARS-CoV-2 tests for the year ended 2021, consisting of 29.7 million PCR and 5.6 million non-PCR tests. In 2022, the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests performed declined to 17.9 million PCR and 2.6 million non-PCR tests as the COVID-19 pandemic was coming under control. _Routine Tests_ Routine clinical laboratory tests are regularly used in general patient care by doctors to establish or support a diagnosis, to monitor treatment or to search for an otherwise undiagnosed condition. The most frequently requested types of test are biochemistry, hematology, coagulation, immunology and bacteriology. We perform these categories of routine tests in all of our laboratories. We perform most routine procedures, and generally report their results within 24 hours, by using a variety of sophisticated and computerized laboratory testing instruments. Our routine testing services include, among others: coagulation tests, blood cell counts; blood chemistry analyses; urinalyses and alcohol and other substance abuse tests. _Specialty Tests_ Specialty clinical laboratory tests involve a higher level of complexity than routine tests, are conducted by skilled laboratory professionals and generally utilize more sophisticated technology, equipment or materials. In contrast to routine test results, which are frequently provided on a same-day basis, the processing time for specialty testing services is typically one day but can range from several days to up to one week for more complex or less frequent testing services. Our specialty testing services involve tests in the following fields, among others: human genetics; molecular oncology; cytology and pathology; hematology and coagulation testing; immunology and immunogenetics; microbiology and infectious diseases; specialized endocrinology; nutritional biology; virology; allergology; serology; toxicology; and drug analysis. We perform specialty testing services in all countries in which we operate. We offer (i) a catalogue of more than 5,000 testing services; (ii) the ability for clients to integrate results directly from our ""Laboratory Information Management System"" into their electronic medical records; (iii) medical and technical multilingual support; and (iv) expertise in the field of sample transportation. Through this know-how, we can satisfy the outsourcing needs of most laboratories around the world, ----- including our clients located in geographies outside of our largest established markets, such as Latin America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa. To remain competitive in the clinical testing market, we intend to further enhance our testing capacity. Teams led by our Chief Medical Officer monitor the scientific literature and trade press, hold talks with test manufacturers and suppliers in order to identify new testing services that become commercially available and, when appropriate, add them to our range of services. Introducing new testing services requires giving information about the testing services to those who can prescribe them (such as doctors and hospitals) and, in many instances, third-party payers that cover the reimbursement of such testing services. We often use our customer service and continuing medical education initiatives to educate prescribers about new testing services. We describe the range of routine and specialty testing services offered by each of our laboratories in our pathology handbook/test catalogue that enables us to keep our main prescribers regularly informed about changes that may occur in the services that we provide. _Anatomic Pathology_ Anatomic pathology is, along with clinical laboratory testing and imaging, one of the principal diagnostics disciplines that we provide. This discipline is dedicated to the morphological study of macroscopic and microscopic anomalies of biological tissues and pathological cells removed from a living or dead human being. Anatomic pathology is widely used in oncology to detect and assess the efficiency of the ablation of tumors. We use the most advanced pathology techniques, using equipment that enables us to perform a wide range of tests, from studies that comprise traditional cytogenetic techniques. Preparing samples is an important and highly technical stage during which a thin slice, only a few microns thick, is placed onto a glass slide before being colored in order to be examined using a microscope. The preparation, examination and diagnosis of a sample cannot be fully automated, which results in substantial labor costs. Anatomic pathology also encompasses cytopathology. Cytopathology studies cells smeared over a glass microscope slide and not cross-sections of cells. The cells are, accordingly, whole cells and can be more easily observed. Some of the most widespread cytologic analyses include lumbar or articular punctures, bone marrow punctures and pap smears. The development of ""telepathology technology"" has paved the way for major progress in the discipline. Sample slides can now be digitalized and shared easily, allowing a doctor's diagnosis to be established more easily and swiftly and enables the sample to be sent to specialized doctors anywhere in the world in the case of a complex pathology. _Medical Imaging and Nuclear Medicine_ Nearly all of our medical imaging and nuclear medicine services are provided by our Italian and Finnish subsidiaries where we have the necessary expertise and cutting-edge technology. (i) Medical Imaging Medical imaging encompasses several disciplines such as radiology, scanography, mammography, orthopantomography (dental imaging), sonography and Doppler sonography. Scanning and mammography are our most widely used disciplines. Technical, technological and IT developments allow more sharply defined and more precise images to be obtained, more rapidly than in the past. We anticipate that this trend is likely to continue to gather momentum. Moreover, systems already enable images to be digitalized and communicated to allow a diagnosis to be made remotely. (ii) Nuclear Medicine Molecular imaging is a medical imaging discipline that provides an in-depth view of what occurs within the human body, at the level of molecules and cells. While conventional medical imaging (i.e., X-rays, scanography and ultrasounds) generates an image of the patient's physical structure, molecular imaging enables a doctor to observe the metabolic or molecular activity of the body or its organs by using a technique that is not significantly invasive. Molecular imaging offers a unique ----- vision of the body that allows doctors to, among other things, detect cancer early and precisely, determine appropriate therapies and monitor the patient's reaction to a specific drug or treatment. _SARS-CoV-2 Tests_ In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, four basic types of laboratory tests have been developed and used to test for SARS-CoV-2: (i) Nucleic-acid amplification tests (including RT-PCR, TMA and LAMP) (""NAAT"") evaluate the presence or absence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, generally in samples from the respiratory tract (e.g., nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, mouth wash, saliva). PCR and equivalent nucleicacid tests are currently considered the most accurate way of determining if a person is carrying SARS-CoV-2. A positive result indicates that the viral genome is present but does not definitively establish if the person is contagious or not. (ii) Serological tests, both rapid and automated immunoassays, detect the presence of antibodies (specific humoral immune response) against SARS-CoV-2 antigenic proteins in a blood sample. Rapid test results are available within 10–15 minutes and a positive result shows that the person has been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the past but gives little or no information on their current infection status. Automated new generation tests provide specific information for each of the involved antibodies, allowing us to quantify IgG antibodies if present to provide information on immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is very relevant for the follow up of vaccination effectiveness. (iii) Cell mediated immunity tests document the cell mediated immunity response to SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccinations. While cell mediated immunity tests are not widely used, they are very important in some specific clinical situations. (iv) Antigen tests measure the presence or absence of the viral proteins (antigens) themselves, most commonly the abundant nucleocapsid protein. The preferred sample type is again nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs, although saliva is already an alternative sample type. Antigen tests are less sensitive than NAAT and their application is limited to symptomatic patients, during a short time after onset of symptoms. We provide testing to support safety at work, at sports events and universities, and when travelling or crossing borders. The aim is to identify potentially contagious individuals as early as possible, which means also detecting the virus in pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers — for which the RT-PCR or an equivalent NAAT is essential.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.11,Services,18.11.2,,"We are active in the field of medical diagnostics and clinical laboratory services. The nature of our services varies from one country to the next and according to the type of establishment. Testing is generally organized in three phases: (i) the pre-analytical phase, which consists of collecting samples and delivering them to the clinical laboratory; (ii) the analytical phase, during which the test itself is carried out; and (iii) the post-analytical phase, during which test results are sent to the prescribing doctor and the patient while our laboratory doctors validate the results and assist with interpreting the results. (i) **_Pre-analytical phase. Before clinical testing is performed, samples are collected from the patient, identified and delivered to our analytical laboratories. Patient samples are labeled immediately with an identification number that is logged into an information technology system by the health practitioner who performed the extraction. Tests are subjected to quality control as well as technical and biological validation procedures. Samples are usually accompanied by a test request form (in electronic or paper format). The form states which testing services are to be performed and provides the necessary billing information. Collecting and analyzing samples taken from patients is often carried out at different locations, and samples therefore are moved from their collection point (such as hospital sites, doctors' practices or our blood collection points) to our laboratories. In most of our markets, including in ----- all of our core market countries of France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, some of our laboratories maintain their own fleets of vehicles and provide both transportation and logistics services in order to ship samples to our laboratories. In other countries, we outsource this service to major transportation companies such as DHL and UPS. The transportation of samples is subject to certain legal requirements, in particular those relating to sample integrity and data confidentiality. Maintaining our own logistics network allows us to tailor logistics solutions for the collection of the samples to the needs and requirements of our customers. (ii) **_Analytical phase. Once the test request form has been entered into our information technology systems and the samples have been collected, the tests are performed, either automatically (in the case of most routine testing services) or by our laboratory doctors or technicians (in the case of most specialty testing services). (iii) **_Post-analytical phase. As soon as they are available and then technically and medically validated, test results are inputted either manually or through an electronic data interchange system that is connected with the practitioner, clinic or hospital, depending upon the kind of testing services carried out, the type of equipment used and the country in which the testing services are performed. We run telephonic service centers to support our clients and our medical experts will consult with practitioners, clinics and hospitals once the results are provided to them.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.12,Operations,18.12.1,Laboratories,"Our operations are conducted through our laboratories and blood collection points. We classify our laboratories into ""hubs"" and ""spokes."" Typically, hubs focus on certain medical areas to perform specialty tests as a center of excellence and spokes focus on highly automated routine and selected specialty tests with quick turnaround time. European reference laboratories and central laboratories are classified as hubs while regional laboratories, satellite laboratories and emergency laboratories are classified as spokes. The type and size of a laboratory varies from one country to another because of differences between healthcare systems and regulatory environments. The number of laboratories that we operate changes regularly as we acquire new laboratories, merge laboratories, win or lose emergency laboratories in hospitals and transform laboratories into blood collection points. _Hub Medical Laboratories_ European Reference Laboratories Our pan-European operations are supported by our two European reference laboratories, near Stuttgart, Germany and near Barcelona, Spain. These laboratories, together with our ""centers of excellence,"" which ----- feature specialist diagnostic expertise and competencies within one specific field of diagnostics, collectively offer processing of the full spectrum of more than 5,000 test parameters and medical advice on a multilingual basis from multidisciplinary teams. The specialty testing services are conducted by highly skilled laboratory professionals led by medical doctors, biologists and chemists and often require our most sophisticated technologies, equipment and materials. The European reference laboratories act as global hub laboratories that can carry out highly sophisticated specialty testing services when subcontracting for other laboratories and are the entry points for samples from countries across the world into our laboratory network. Samples are transported by air and results are electronically provided to customers, including hospitals, prescribing doctors and patients. This business is particularly developed in Europe and in Latin America (in particular, Brazil and Mexico), where our local subsidiaries or partners connect us with new customers. In other countries in Latin America (e.g., Uruguay), Eastern Europe, Africa or the Middle East where we do not have our own subsidiaries, we use commercial agents in order to set up partnerships. Central Laboratories Our central laboratories, located in nearly all of the countries in which we operate, are centralized, highly specialized laboratories with specific, specialty testing capabilities, including test parameters outside the full routine spectrum of testing services, such as, among others, serology, autoimmunity and molecular testing. Such specialty testing services are conducted by highly skilled laboratory professionals. Specialty testing services from across our laboratory network are primarily conducted in our state-of-the-art central laboratories in order to maximize utilization rates and efficiency. Our central laboratories often also house many of our ""centers of excellence."" _Spoke Medical Laboratories_ Regional Laboratories Our regional laboratories are highly automated and equipped with advanced equipment to perform high volume routine testing services. Our regional laboratories centralize the processing of all or some test samples from blood collection points, satellite laboratories and emergency laboratories, and typically offer a test spectrum of several hundred different testing services. Due to the highly automated processes of our advanced, multipurpose testing equipment, the processing time at its regional laboratories is frequently only a few hours, with same-day delivery of results. Satellite Laboratories Our satellite laboratories perform routine testing services prescribed by doctors and medical institutions in connection with general patient care to establish or support a diagnosis, to monitor treatment or to search for an otherwise undiagnosed condition. Many of our satellite laboratories are located in or near the hospitals that they primarily serve. Results of routine testing at our satellite laboratories are predominantly delivered to patients and prescribing healthcare professionals on a same-day basis. Emergency Laboratories Our emergency laboratories are located in, or adjacent to, the hospitals that they primarily serve and are focused on quickly providing results on the shortest possible turnaround times, in many cases 24 hours a day and up to seven days a week. Emergency laboratories perform basic and emergency tests prescribed by doctors and medical institutions in connection with general patient care to establish or support a diagnosis, to monitor treatment or to search for an otherwise undiagnosed condition.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The range of services we offer differs according to customers' needs. Some customers want to outsource all of their clinical laboratory services, while others prefer to keep some of these services in-house such as, for instance, sampling, the logistics involved in collecting samples, the diagnosis of certain types of pathologies, medical validation or emergency services. The markets in which we offer to subcontract and outsource clinical laboratory services are characterized by high barriers to entry since the process followed in a call for tenders requires a company to invest considerable time before being selected as a potential subcontractor. Being selected requires technical expertise and substantial investment capacities. Finally, the reputation and experience of the bidders are key criteria if they are to be picked as a subcontractor. We consider a number of strategic reasons for this type of cooperation, in all cases depending on different markets, business models and customer requirements. For example, we might enter into joint ventures with hospitals as an opportunity to expand our medical and scientific know-how, consider fully integrating a partner into our hub-and-spoke operating model or simply take advantage of favorable cost efficiency that outsourcing and subcontracting may present.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.13,Operating Segments and Core Markets,18.13.1,France,"We first entered the diagnostic services market in France in 2004. As of September 30, 2023, we operated 67 laboratories and approximately 387 blood collection points in France. Approximately 75% of our business in France is B2C (direct business only). Each of our laboratories and blood collection points in France employs a medical doctor or a specially trained pharmacist (both commonly referred to as ""biologists""). Our laboratories are distributed throughout France and are mainly located in small towns or rural areas, but we are also present in major cities such as Bordeaux, Marseille, Montpellier, Nantes, Nice, Lille and Paris. Our limited operations in large cities is due to our belief that clinical laboratories can be bought at more attractive prices in small towns than in big cities, while the revenue and average profitability per laboratory in large cities is generally lower than the national average in France. ----- We are the fourth largest provider of clinical laboratory testing in France based on revenue, with the top three making up approximately 53% of the market. Our primary competitors in France include Cerba, Biogroup, Inovie, Unilabs and Eurofins Scientific. The portion of the French market addressable by us as a private laboratory company is expected to grow at approximately a 1% CAGR from 2023 to 2028. (Source: Company Data Analysis) A key initiative in France is opening new and refurbishing existing blood collection points. We are focused on optimizing our blood collection point networks by opening in relevant areas and improving patients' experiences through investments in digital tools. A second key initiative for us in France is ensuring our ability to answer all national and relevant regional or local tenders for test campaigns.

504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.14,Acquisitions and External Growth Strategy,18.14.1,,"Significant parts of the European clinical laboratory services market remain fragmented. As the leading consolidator in the European clinical laboratory services market (based on the number of acquisitions completed), we are well positioned to drive market consolidation. ----- Since our founding, we have developed our business both through strategic acquisitions of local and regional laboratories, as well as through selective acquisitions of larger clinical laboratory groups to access new markets and expand our presence in existing markets. Our M&A strategy is based on four axes: (i) focusing on our core market countries aimed at densification of the operating with multiple add-on acquisitions in order to streamline operations; (ii) in the other existing countries, focusing on bolt-on acquisitions to densify and expand territories; (iii) the acquisition of ""new platforms"" by entering into new countries or regions with the aim to pursue future bolt-on acquisitions; and (iv) other acquisitions aimed at increasing certain skill sets, technologies and other value accretive acquisitions. We typically analyze acquisition targets in terms of enterprise value-to-EBITDA multiples and aim to deleverage following their restructuring and integration. Based on an analysis we conducted in 2018, we estimate that average acquisition multiples for bolt-on M&A acquisitions carried out in 2016 and 2017 were between 6–7x enterprise value-to-EBITDA including estimated post-acquisition synergy-led EBITDA improvements during the first full calendar year for 2017 acquisitions and the second full calendar year for 2016 acquisitions. The enterprise value acquired in the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately €130 million (2021: €225 million). M&A activity in 2020 was reduced due to the COVID19 pandemic before returning in 2021 and 2022 as we reviewed a strong pipeline of opportunities across existing and new markets. In 2023, to build on our current M&A strategy and to align with the current market environment, we have shifted our focus from large acquisitions and increased our focus on portfolio optimization, including divesting low-margin businesses and geographies. From the formation of the SYNLAB Group in the second half of 2015 through September 30, 2023, we completed 159 acquisitions of laboratories (excluding additional acquisitions in business units that were sold during that period). Built as the combination of two large businesses, we have a successful track record of sector consolidation. We have developed a structured and disciplined approach to acquisitions to complete transactions efficiently and effectively. This approach enables us to achieve favorable financial and legal terms and conditions, while still executing quickly enough to acquire the most attractive opportunities. Potential acquisition targets are initially screened for their strategic fit by our country chief executive officers. Potential acquisitions targets are then further screened at a group level. This review takes place once a target is identified and validated and before a non-binding offer is submitted. Our M&A department reviews potential target laboratories in close coordination with our local management (in the case of acquisitions in existing markets) and our group sourcing and operations teams. The same department is also tasked with finding targets in new countries or with sourcing larger deals. Final approvals of acquisitions are subject to consideration and satisfaction of a rigorous set of criteria, including, among others, (i) geographic and strategic fit; (ii) mandatory financial, tax, legal, labor, compliance and operational due diligence; (iii) additional commercial due diligence for new markets or new business lines; (iv) valuation multiples; (v) synergy potential; and (vi) review by our post-merger integration teams. Integration of acquisitions is led primarily by our country management teams, with oversight and support provided by management at a group level. Post-merger integration targets the realization of identified synergies, including laboratory network optimization, process improvement, back-office centralization, insourcing of specialty tests (to our European reference laboratories as well as national hub laboratories) and procurement optimization. As part of our procurement optimization strategy, we implement our panEuropean framework agreements with preferred suppliers upon closing of the acquisition and implement standardized laboratory processes and best practices in a phased manner. For acquisitions of local and regional laboratories, as well as larger businesses, once the acquisition has been completed, we typically aim to achieve about half the expected synergies in the first twelve months, and the majority of the remaining synergies during the second year. Where we purchase laboratory businesses directly from laboratory doctors, we generally prefer for those laboratory doctors to continue operating them. In the case of sizeable acquisitions, we aim to retain the key managers in our local management teams, to ensure retention of specialist and local market knowledge.

Lastly, we consider any ----- party that pays for the testing services performed to be a ""payer."" In most cases and depending on the country, our customers, patients and payers may each be different persons or entities. Our customer base varies considerably from country to country. The main categories of customers to whom we provide our services are: - **_Patients. Patients with a prescription for testing from their doctor may choose the clinical laboratory in which their testing services will be performed. The main factor taken into consideration when choosing a laboratory is usually how close it is to the patient's home or workplace. - **_Independent healthcare professionals and partnerships of health professionals. In each of our core market countries, physicians determine which laboratory tests should be performed and, in certain countries, healthcare professionals who require testing for their patients can recommend our laboratories. Healthcare professionals take samples themselves and send them to hospitals or private laboratories such as ours and determine themselves where the sample is sent. Consequently, the relationship with healthcare professionals is of significant commercial importance and as a result, we create personal relationships to generate trust and confidence in our services. - **_Hospitals. We provide hospitals with services ranging from routine and specialty testing to contract management services with attractive prices. We operate certain clinical laboratories that hospitals generally maintain on-site to perform immediate testing. However, hospitals may also refer less time-sensitive, less frequently needed and/or more highly specialized procedures to outside facilities, including independent clinical laboratories such as ours. - **_Laboratories. We perform specialty testing services for other clinical testing laboratories via our hub medical laboratories. - **_Private medical insurance companies. In certain countries, private medical insurance companies typically require their insured patients to choose from a list of pre-selected laboratories with which these insurers have a reimbursement contract. The list varies depending on the patient's private insurance scheme. - **_Companies. In some jurisdictions, employees are entitled to a regular medical check-up and other prevention and wellness services paid for by their employers. The services related to these check-ups are generally provided by specialized companies that subsequently subcontract the tests to a private laboratory. - **_Governments.

The primary equipment and materials required to conduct our business activities are testing equipment (including analytical systems, robotics, and pre- and postanalytical devices), reagents and other consumables. We regularly review our testing equipment needs and have entered into several pan-European procurement agreements with certain preferred laboratory suppliers for the supply of reagents and testing equipment, related services and maintenance. Our diversified supplier base includes leading diagnostics suppliers such as Abbott, Beckman Coulter, Becton Dickinson, bioMérieux, DiaSorin, Roche Diagnostics, Siemens Healthineers, Thermo Fisher Scientific and many others, the top 20 of which represented 26.7% of our total spent. Multiple suppliers can supply us with the equipment required to perform our testing services and we have more than one supplier for each diagnostic field. Accordingly, we do not believe that we are dependent on any single supplier and therefore losing one of our current suppliers would probably not have a material adverse effect on our business. Our supply agreements enable us to benefit from the latest technological and medical advances and strike the right balance between total cost, innovation, flexibility and risk management, as quality is one of our key priorities. Our medical team is involved from the very beginning of the tendering process by drafting specifications for every category of operation with which suppliers must comply.

We rent nearly all of our premises and a majority (by value) of our laboratory equipment. Our policy is to lease rather than own our facilities, preferably through long-term leases, except where concentrated activity justifies the acquisition of the buildings in which these activities are conducted, such as certain property in Colombia, Spain and Germany. We believe that our laboratories are generally adequate for our present needs and that suitable additional or replacement space would be available to the extent required. In 2019, we applied IFRS 16 (Leases) for the first time. IFRS 16 (Leases) introduced new or amended requirements with respect to lease accounting by removing the distinction between operating and finance leases and, subject to limited exceptions, requiring the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement. As of December 31, 2022, we owned property, plant and equipment with a carrying amount of €311.5 million and had right-of-use assets with a net carrying amount of €656.0 million. The property, plant and equipment that we own consists mainly of technical equipment and installations, particularly automated devices and tools used to perform clinical testing, office and IT facilities, fixtures and fittings for the premises and vehicles.

We have a young, diverse and highly skilled workforce that is increasing frequently, mainly due to our external growth policy. As of December 31, 2022, 51% of our employees were aged 40 years of age or below and 49% were more than 40 years old.

The geographic breakdown for the rest of our employees was 30% in our North & East segment and 37% in our South segment. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our payroll and related expenses amounted to €1,166.7 million, including wages and salaries of €759.2 million, social security contributions of €234.8 million and other personnel related costs (including bonus payments and premiums) of €100.1 million. The expenses related to the Executive Long-term Incentive Plan and employee participation program described below will be included in our future payroll and related expenses, and associated costs have been incorporated in our midterm business plan. _Employee Representation_ The countries in which we operate provide various protections and other rights to employees. These employment rights may require us to expend greater time and cost in altering or amending employees' terms of employment or making staff reductions. Elections for employee representative bodies have been held in accordance with applicable legislation. The rights, obligations and operating methods of these bodies vary from one country to another, depending on local legislation. We are subject to certain mandatory bargaining agreements in certain countries, such as Germany, and collective bargaining agreements with unions representing our employees in certain other countries, including in Italy and Hungary. In Germany, certain of our employees are represented by works councils (Betriebsrat) and other representative bodies for employees with various information, consultation and codetermination rights. For example, in some jurisdictions, they must be notified in advance of any employee layoffs, must consent to the hiring and relocation of employees and are granted co-determination rights in social matters, such as work schedules and rules of conduct, as well as the rights to advice in respect of certain transactions such as providing guarantees, attracting loans or the granting of security. As German law prohibits asking employees whether they are members of unions, we do not know how many of our employees are unionized. In general, our employees in Germany fall within the scope of the German Dismissal Protection Act (Kündigungsschutzgesetz), which limits our ability to terminate individual employment relationships unilaterally. We also comply with the German Anti-Discrimination Act (Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz) and comparable legislation in other countries in which we operate. In France, social dialogue is structured at the company level. Each company has, if necessary, a works council and trade union representatives or a single staff representative body, depending on the number of employees and the complexity of the company's structure. The management of each company negotiates agreements with the representative trade unions on subjects such as incentive plans, gender equality and working time reduction and flexibility. Such company's management chairs the bodies and can negotiate company-wide agreements with the company's trade union representatives. In the United Kingdom, indepth work has been carried out with social partners to define the rules and organization governing the transfer of staff from the NHS to us under a public-private partnership. We believe that our relationships with our employees are generally good. We have not suffered any material work stoppages or strikes in recent years. _Employee Retention_ Strategic actions are taken in order to maintain employee motivation and focus so they elect to remain employed and fully productive for us. These include SYNLAB Dialogue, our Group-wide employee engagement survey, which measures a team's level of engagement, and Performance Management, which promotes an environment for feedback to be requested, given, and received at least twice a year. We also ensure employees are rewarded for their efforts, including access to special bonuses to recognize their great mobilization in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent highlights include an increased bonus for night shifts and negotiated long collective-bargaining agreements with the unions in Germany, as well as new incentive programs such as profit sharing in France. ----- _Employee Participation Program_ An employee share purchase plan was launched at the end of 2021, enabling all our permanent employees to become shareholders from 2022. The plan enables us to reward the employees' contribution to the success of the Group and also provides them the opportunity to build up a stake in our future performance of. Under the plan, the employees have the opportunity to buy shares in the Issuer and receive one free additional share for every four shares purchased after a period of four years of service.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

We do so for the benefit of, and in cooperation with, our external stakeholders, including customers, financial stakeholders (i.e., shareholders and bondholders), local communities, suppliers and service providers, public administrations and the media. Our CSR strategy supports the implementation of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, with particular focus on (i) good health and well-being, (ii) gender equality, (iii) decent work and economic growth and (iv) responsible consumption and production. Our ESG program takes into account diagnostics for the planet, diagnostics for people and ethical diagnostics. We recognize that we can only be successful in the long term if we respect the environmental and social context in which we operate. Our corporate governance is also crucial to our customers' trust in us, whether in terms of the quality of our clinical work or the protection of confidential personal information Our key ESG objectives include: (i) reducing the environmental impact of every test we deliver and limiting our contribution to climate change; (ii) creating positive outcomes in our communities and empowering our diverse employees; and (iii) operating with the highest standards in governance and compliance and assuming our role as a responsible corporate citizen. We are aware that the environment can dramatically change our practices and relationships with our stakeholders. Our policy therefore encompasses the management and control of our footprint to limit and mitigate the impact of our activities on the environment and available natural resources. In the medium term, we are focused on the ""SYNLAB Green"" objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reducing waste generation. Our global CO2 emissions per million euros of revenue were 9.6 million tons in 2022, a reduction from 11.3 million tons in 2021. We believe that social responsibility is not possible if the needs of the people in the communities where we operate and those that we impact are not taken into account as a priority. We therefore strive to foster sustainable human development through our commitment to society at large and, more specifically, to the local communities in which our team members live and work. We also focus on developing social capital and improving the quality of life for the entire community. Our efforts are also aimed at future generations, acknowledging the legacy that our actions can generate. We are focused on the ""SYNLAB Care"" objectives of increasing health and safety in the workplace, increasing diversity and equality, improving access to topquality healthcare, developing growth opportunities for our employees, retaining and winning new, talented employees, financing further research and innovation and providing charitable contributions to overcome societal challenges. We further believe that reliability and integrity are key concepts in modern corporate governance and sustained business growth is only possible where a firm is able to trust in the reliability of its shareholders, customers, suppliers, members and employees—locally and globally. The cornerstone to building and improving our reputation with all of our stakeholders is consistently upholding high standards of social and ethical conduct. We are focused on the ""SYNLAB Citizenship"" objectives of completing the implementation of our governance policies based on the highest professional standards, fully complying with applicable corporate guidelines and policies, industry-specific regulations as well as environmental, health and safety regulations, complying with applicable tax law and transparent disclosure and implementing responsible supply chain management practices. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted and deepened our commitments to supporting communities, ensuring healthy lives, promoting well-being and delivering the highest quality diagnostic services to our customers. In 2020, we formalized our governance arrangements, identified and prioritized sustainability issues, established measurable and time-bound targets and produced our first formal ESG report. In 2021, we published for the first time our collective approach to sustainability, our goals and activities in an ESG ----- report. Through this report, we aim to express our long-term commitment to continuous improvement in our management practices. Amongst these is our focus to become a carbon-neutral business by 2025 as well as our plans to establish a corporate foundation as a way to give back to the local communities in the countries we operate in. Furthermore, we aim to increase female representation in top and senior management positions by 2021. We are also putting our supply chain under closer scrutiny with steps to identify any human rights risks in the supply chain. In 2022 and beyond, we intend to further improve our data measurement and disclosure for key ESG issues and develop new programs and policies that support our ESG targets.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Our strong reputation and market position enable us to attract and retain industry-leading medical experts and qualified specialists. As a result, we have cultivated a wide network of medical experts, who collaborate on dozens of projects led by university research departments and the pharmaceutical industry, and we sometimes fund research grants to continuously enhance our diagnostic offerings. We have continued to grow the number of registered publications with more than double the volume in 2020 compared to 2015. Our scientists published 368 scientific articles in 2022 alone. We also honor cutting edge research and publications with the SYNLAB Medical Innovation Awards and maintain a Research Grants program to foster innovation and medical excellence. Our innovation pipeline is further sourced from the research and development of our equipment and test suppliers. Our expertise in leveraging our operational scale and global presence allows us to bring new technologies and innovative offerings to market quickly and make them accessible even in remote locations. Alongside our diagnostic innovation management, a main focus is on digitalization and the advancement of digital customer interfaces. We continuously invest in increasing our patients' and clinicians' digital experience and enhancing patient access to preventative care and medical wellness. We operate an IT development center in Denmark, which for example has developed broadly applicable patient interfaces like SYNLAB Access and tailor-made customer solutions, which were used for our cooperation with UEFA across 50 countries. As of December 31, 2022, we owned or had the right to a limited number of trademarks or trade names related to our business. We operate under several different business names, trademarks and service brands. We have consolidated a large portion of our business under the ""SYNLAB"" name. When acquiring new laboratories, we often continues to operate for a period of time under the business name of the acquired laboratory in order to gain access to its customer base and reap the benefit of the prestige associated with the trademark or business name of the laboratory concerned, before co-branding the existing name with SYNLAB and eventually fully transitioning the laboratory to the SYNLAB brand. Our trademarks are of value to our business, but, other than the ""SYNLAB"" trademark, we do not believe that any of our other business names, service brands and trademarks are essential for our business activities or that any single trademark other than our ""SYNLAB"" brand name is material to our business as a whole. We have also registered several domain names. We actively protect our intellectual property, particularly by registering our trademarks and business names. We also often continue to protect the trademarks of businesses that we acquire. In order to provide the highest quality of service to our customers, we place considerable emphasis on using equipment at the cutting edge of technology in our laboratories. Although we design and perform new tests, we do not have any specific research and development centers or employee categories devoted to research.

We also operate in a regulated business sector and, as such, are subject, in the ordinary course of our business, to particular controls and supervision by the competent national or local healthcare authorities. Regulations with which we must comply may increase our costs or restrict our activities. Failure to comply with such regulations may lead to sanctions of various types. Future alterations to regulations that apply to us could have a material adverse impact on our business. We set aside provisions where there is a sufficient probability of the litigation in question leading to costs for us or any of our subsidiaries.

Compared to the predecessor Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC), the GDPR entails significantly stricter requirements for data mapping and accountability, transparency, data subject rights, processor (service provider) obligations, and the requirement to designate a data protection officer. In addition, the GDPR and local data protection rules (such as the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, ""BDSG"") provide strict requirements on the processing of sensitive personal data (so-called special categories of personal data), like genetic and health data of individuals, including on the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure security of this data. The GDPR and the BDSG introduced substantial sanctions for non-compliance and, depending on the nature of the infringed provision, may consist of civil liabilities, cease-and-desist orders from competitors, criminal sanctions and/or administrative fines, and adverse publicity and reputational damages. Administrative fines can amount to €20 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual revenue of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, for each violation. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether valid or not, may harm our reputation.

504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,58,REGULATION,58.2,France,58.2.1,Description of the Regulations Applicable in France,"_Applicable Rules to the Operation of Clinical Laboratories_ In France, the establishment and operation of clinical laboratories historically required an administrative authorization. This authorization was issued by the relevant departmental prefects, after review of an application that described in detail the premises, equipment, performed tests and operating procedures of each laboratory, as well as the professional qualifications of the laboratory staff (including laboratory doctors), the governance of the laboratory and its corporate form. The regulations set minimal standards to be met in each of these areas. While the authorization was not issued for a limited period of time, it could ----- be withdrawn if the legal requirements for operating a clinical laboratory ceased to be fulfilled. Any change in the above had to be notified to the competent administrative authorities. Since a January 13, 2010 Ordinance (ordonnance n°2010-49 relative à la biologie médicale), as amended, companies contemplating opening a clinical laboratory must now obtain, instead of an authorization issued by departmental prefects, an accreditation delivered by the French Committee for Accreditation (COFRAC) and notify their activity to the ARS (Agence régionale de santé) prior to the opening of the clinical laboratory. The Law n°2020-734 of June 17, 2020 (and Ministerial Orders of July 16, 2020 and March 8, 2021) clarified that the accreditation must cover all medical biology activities carried out by clinical laboratories. A transitional regime has been introduced. Under this regime, existing administrative authorizations, granted before the publication of the Ordinance n° 2010-49 of January 13, 2010, are to remain in force until the clinical laboratories that hold them are accredited. New authorizations can no longer be issued as of the date of the publication of the ordinance, except in a very small number of cases, and under certain conditions, in the context of the restructuring of existing laboratories or site openings. At the same time, accreditation is gradually being made compulsory, in the following manner: - since November 1, 2016, clinical laboratories are no longer allowed to operate without an accreditation covering 50% of the clinical tests they perform (or at least clinical laboratories must have initiated the accreditation process before October 31, 2016, for 50% of the tests they carry out including at least one test within each category of clinical tests, in which case they could continue to operate until they were given an answer about their accreditation application by COFRAC and until December 31, 2017, at the latest). Initially, there were two possible options for entering the accreditation process: route A, consisting of in a partial COFRAC accreditation (option chosen by 48% of French clinical laboratories) and route B, consisting in a 36-month ""Bio Quality"" recognition (option chosen by 52% of French clinical laboratories). All of the Group's SELs (except one) have chosen route A as it is a longer lasting solution under the transitional provisions. Laboratories that opted for route B must apply to COFRAC for accreditation by no later than April 30, 2015. Fewer than 20% of laboratories that opted for route B had filed an accreditation application on November 1, 2014. The mandatory deadline stipulated by the Law of May 30, 2013 has had the effect of accelerating consolidation in the French clinical laboratory market, as the laboratories experiencing difficulties in their accreditation process were forced to merge rapidly with accredited structures. Based on discussions with the various market operators, the Group stands out clearly as the network with the highest number of accredited laboratories. The accreditation process were to be addressed to COFRAC by any non-accredited laboratory no later than May 31, 2013, and; in the event of an incomplete application, the non-accredited laboratory's application were to be regularized no later than October 31, 2013. In 2015, each clinical laboratory had to submit to COFRAC either an initial request for accreditation which will cover at least 50% of the clinical tests that it carries out, or, for clinical laboratories already having a partial accreditation, an accreditation extension request to cover at least 50 % of accredited tests by April 30, 2015. In both circumstances, accreditation must apply to at least one test within each category of clinical test that the laboratory carries out; and - since November 1, 2021, clinical laboratories are no longer allowed to carry out clinical tests corresponding to a group of tests called ""ligne de portée"" without having requested or obtained from COFRAC an accreditation covering this _ligne de portée. The deadline has initially been set at November 1, 2020 and was extended (i.e., to November 1, 2021) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, pursuant to the Law n°2020-734 of June 17, 2020 and Ministerial Order of June 1, 2021. The Law n°2020-734 of June 17, 2020 and the Ministerial Orders of July 16, 2020 and March 8, 2021 simplified the accreditation process. Instead of issuing accreditation to every single clinical test carried out by clinical laboratories, COFRAC would issue accreditations by lignes de portée (a ligne de portée corresponds to a group of clinical tests with similar features and a common accreditation methodology of assessment). Each ligne de portée has representative tests and related professional skills. When ----- COFRAC issues an accreditation to representative tests, all clinical tests included in the same group (ligne de portée) are considered compliant with the obligation to acquire accreditation. The French National Commission for Medical Biology (Commission nationale de biologie médicale, CNBM) suggests to the French Health Minister the representative tests and common professional skills associated with each _ligne de portée to be accredited. The representative tests and common professional skills associated with each ligne de portée have been listed by the French Health Minister in a Ministerial Order dated March 8, 2021. A clinical laboratory is considered accredited when all of its _lignes de portée are accredited by COFRAC. Accreditation under ISO 15189 (the international quality standard for clinical laboratories) is delivered by COFRAC. According to the accreditation rules (règlement d'accréditation) of COFRAC, in the latest version published on October 15, 2022 (SH REF 05 – Révision 16), the very first accreditation of a clinical laboratory is set to expire within four years following its delivery and is subject to regular on-site audits (the first on-site audit must be carried out at the latest twelve months after the entry into force of the first accreditation and then on-site audits must be carried out at least every fifteen months during the first four years), for so long as the first accreditation is in force. At the end of this first four-year period, a renewal audit is then undertaken and, if satisfactory, a no higher than five-year accreditation is delivered and remains subject to regular on-site audits (they must be carried out at least every twenty-three months). COFRAC may suspend or withdraw a clinical laboratory's accreditation for all or part of the laboratory's business if it fails to comply with applicable requirements or in the event of fraud, intentional concealment of information or disclosure of false information. The mandatory timeline stipulated by the Law of May 30, 2013 (as modified by the subsequent regulations) has had the effect of accelerating consolidation in the French clinical laboratory market, as the laboratories experiencing difficulties with their accreditation process were forced to merge rapidly with accredited structures. The ARSs, as the competent administrative authorities in France, are responsible for ensuring that clinical laboratories comply with existing sanitary and safety regulations through on-site inspections. Any change in the operating conditions of a laboratory or in the legal or financial structure of the company operating the laboratory must be notified to the competent ARS(s). In addition, some tests or categories of tests are controlled by specialized agencies as part of an annual quality control program. The ARSs may impose administrative sanctions on SELs, as well as, in certain instances, on laboratory doctors and on third parties (e.g., prohibited investors), that infringe certain provisions of the applicable regulation (in particular, health, safety and quality requirements). These sanctions range from fines (potentially up to €2 million per SEL) to the temporary or permanent closure of the laboratory, in the case of particularly serious or repeated violations. The operation of laboratories is restricted, as described below, based on administrative geographic areas that are defined by each ARS (""zones""). A clinical laboratory can be located on one or several sites. There is no limit under French law to the number of sites that a clinical laboratory may operate, insofar as the clinical laboratory has an accreditation for all groups of clinical tests (lignes de portée) or requested it. However, sites of a clinical laboratory cannot be located in more than three adjacent zones (as defined by the competent ARS(s)), barring an exemption granted by the general director of the competent ARS under the conditions set out by Article R. 6222-4 of the French Public Health Code and included in the regional health organization plan (schéma regional de _santé)._ The competent ARS can, or must, reject any opening of new sites in certain cases defined by the French Public Health Code. For instance: - the ARS's general director may oppose the opening of a clinical laboratory or site if it would result in an increase in the relevant zone's clinical tests' offer (offre d'examens de biologie médicale) to a level 25% higher than the population's needs, as defined by the regional health organization plan. - They may also oppose, on grounds related to the risk of affecting the continuity of clinical testing availability, an acquisition or restructuring (including a merger) affecting a clinical laboratory or site when this acquisition or restructuring would result in the number of tests performed by the laboratory ----- resulting from the acquisition or restructuring exceeding the threshold of 25% of all clinical tests carried out in the relevant zone. - Finally, the acquisition of shares of companies operating a clinical laboratory is not authorized when such an acquisition would enable a person or entity to control, directly or indirectly, a portion of the clinical tests' offer higher than 33% of all clinical tests carried out in the same zone. A person or entity is deemed to control more than 33% of all clinical tests carried out in a zone if they own, directly or indirectly, the majority of the share capital of several companies operating a clinical laboratory, and the combined business of those companies represents more than 33% of all clinical tests in that zone. French law also limits the number of tests that can be outsourced by one clinical laboratory to another for analysis and interpretation every year to 15% of the total number of tests carried out by the outsourcing laboratory. Subcontracting contracts must be registered with the competent ARS and professional associations (Ordres) (and the ministry of defense if applicable). Clinical laboratories, however, are free to distribute the tests to be carried out between their various sites as they wish. They can even concentrate the performance of all tests in a single site. Laboratory doctors (biologistes médicaux) (qualified doctors or pharmacists), laboratory technicians and nurses who collect samples taken from patients must meet minimum professional qualifications. In France, each clinical laboratory must be supervised by at least one laboratory doctor (called the responsible laboratory doctor (biologiste-responsable)) who acts as the legal representative of the laboratory company operating the laboratory. This laboratory doctor is responsible for the laboratory's operations, including the processing of tests outsourced to other laboratories. A laboratory doctor can hold the position of responsible or co-responsible laboratory doctor in only one laboratory. Each of a laboratory's sites must also be supervised during its opening hours by a laboratory doctor who can be identified at all times and who can intervene within a timeframe that is compatible with the guarantee of patients' safety. Hence any laboratory shall have a number of laboratory doctors equal to at least the number of sites that it has created. Laboratory doctors working in laboratories are subject to the same rules of professional conduct as doctors and pharmacists, depending on the professional association (Ordre) they are members of. Laboratory doctors must be registered with the relevant Ordre (the Ordre des pharmaciens for qualified pharmacists and the Ordre des médecins for qualified medical doctors). Companies operating a clinical laboratory must also be registered with either one or both Ordres, based on the professional affiliation of the laboratory doctors practicing within the laboratories they operate. The professional associations (the Ordres) are self-regulating bodies with administrative and disciplinary powers over practicing doctors and pharmacists, and over the companies that have registered with them. They also represent the collective interests of pharmacists (in the case of the Ordre des pharmaciens) and medical doctors (in the case of the Ordre des médecins), including, in both cases, the interests of laboratory doctors, before French public authorities. These Ordres may be called upon to issue opinions on certain issues involving their profession, including when bills and regulations are being drafted. They also monitor compliance with applicable laws, regulations and rules of professional conduct by practicing professionals and professional companies. The principle of independence, defined respectively for pharmacists and doctors in articles R. 4235-18 and R. 4127-5 of the French Public Health Code, is one of the professional conduct rules enforced by the _Ordres. Under this principle, a pharmacist must not be subject to any financial, commercial, technical or_ moral constraint, if such constraint could impair his or her professional independence. As for medical doctors, article R. 4127-5 of the French Public Health Code provides that a medical doctor cannot, in any manner whatsoever, compromise his or her professional independence. When the responsible laboratory doctor thinks that the decisions taken by a physical or legal person operating a clinical laboratory could endanger patients' health, public health or the operating rules of the laboratory provided for in the French Public Health Code, the responsible laboratory doctor informs the general director of the competent ARS, who will then take appropriate measures. The Ordre des pharmaciens and the Ordre des médecins maintain, as far as each is concerned, a register of practicing professionals (tableau de l'Ordre), on which every practicing pharmacist, doctor and professional company must be registered, thereby regulating access to the profession. New companies operating clinical ----- laboratories must apply for registration in the relevant register. An _Ordre_ may withhold or suspend registration if it notices that the applicant has breached the relevant rules of professional conduct. Clinical laboratories are subject to ongoing regulatory supervision by the Ordres and must therefore submit certain proposed actions to the relevant Ordre or Ordres for review. These actions include any proposed change in the share capital or in the articles of association (statuts) of the companies that operate the laboratories, any cooperation contract entered into with other clinical laboratories and, more generally, any agreement relating to the operations of laboratories or governing relations between their shareholders. After reviewing this information, the Ordres may inform the ARSs of any breaches of the regulations. The ARSs are not bound by the findings of the Ordres in this respect. Each professional _Ordre, using its administrative and disciplinary powers, may impose administrative measures and disciplinary sanctions on professional companies and laboratory doctors (doctors or pharmacists). An _Ordre_ may especially delist a professional company from the register (Tableau de _l'Ordre) and temporarily or permanently suspend practicing laboratory doctors who have breached rules of_ professional conduct. Certain illegal activities, including the illegal practice of clinical biology and the misleading use of the title of laboratory doctor, carry criminal penalties that range from a prohibition from practicing clinical biology or operating a clinical laboratory, to imprisonment for natural persons. Clinical laboratories may not advertise their services, directly or indirectly, to the general public. However, scientific information given to medical doctors and pharmacists, the public announcement of the existence and location of a clinical laboratory published at the time of its opening or the opening of its sites, and references to the accreditation of a laboratory, are excluded from this prohibition. With regard to pricing and reimbursement, clinical laboratories are bound by the prices set by the Union _nationale des caisses d'assurance maladie (UNCAM). These prices are revised regularly following_ negotiations between the UNCAM and professional biologists' trade unions and approved by the Ministries of Health and Social Affairs. Several agreements have been signed by the main French professional biologists' trade unions and UNCAM to regulate prices regarding clinical laboratories activity. An agreement was signed on October 10, 2013, by the main French professional biologists' trade unions and UNCAM following the government's announcement in 2012 of its plan to cut healthcare spending on French clinical laboratories by at least €110 million. The agreement aims to map out the business prospects of clinical laboratories for a three-year period while continuing to control healthcare spending. It aims to limit annual growth in clinical spending to 0.25% between 2014 and 2016, through moderate, gradual rate reductions and control over prescriptions, in order to offset natural volume growth. Professional unions meet with UNCAM every six months to measure the impact of enacted rate changes and to determine the upcoming changes that may need to be made to achieve the annual growth target. In January 2016, on the basis of 2015 figures and information about the trend in early 2016, UNCAM decided to implement a decrease in rates applicable as from April 20, 2016. A further temporary decrease in rates between November 15, 2016, and December 31, 2016, was agreed between UNCAM and professional unions to slow down the fast growth recorded during the first nine months of 2016. In 2016, UNCAM and professional unions also agreed on November 7, 2016, on the extension of the three-year agreement for another three-year period (2017-2019 included), at the same annual growth targeted limit of 0.25%, with a revised system for better managing semi-annual adjustments. In order to reach the annual growth targeted limit, UNCAM decided to implement again a temporary decrease in rates between November 20, 2018 and December 31, 2018. A new agreement was signed on March 11, 2020 between the main French professional biologists' trade unions and UNCAM which extends for three more years (2020-2022) the previous agreement and amends it. The targeted maximal annual growth in clinical spending is increased to 0.4% in 2020, 0.5% in 2021 and 0.6% in 2022. It also aims at taking into account the impact of health crisis or of public health decisions on clinical spending. An agreement has been signed on January 10, 2023 between the main French professional biologists' trade unions and UNCAM to implement a decrease in rates applicable from February 1, 2023. In addition, an agreement signed on July 27, 2023 aims to limit annual growth in clinical spending to 0.4% between 2024 and 2026. This agreement is still subject to amendments. Patients are reimbursed for expenses for clinical tests if the performed tests are registered upon a predetermined list set by the UNCAM and the tests have been prescribed in compliance with applicable rules. The French authorities may be tempted in the future to extend the scope of the clinical tests which do ----- not give rise to a reimbursement by the public health insurance funds, hence resulting in a significant decrease of the related prescriptions and revenue. There is a different regime for laboratories to obtain payment for tests performed at the request of the patient without a prescription. Such clinical tests are not subject to reimbursement by UNCAM. Instead, they are paid for directly by the patient. When the relevant medical biologist performs such tests, he should inform the patient of their non-reimbursable nature and requests his agreement to carry them out. The same applies where the tests have been prescribed but are not reimbursable. _Restrictions on the Ownership and Corporate Governance of Companies Operating Clinical Laboratories_ French laws and regulations impose restrictions on the ownership and corporate governance structure of companies operating a clinical laboratory. Almost all of our clinical laboratories in France are operated by SELASs (société d'exercice libéral par actions simplifiée)_ which are a specific category of SELs. This kind of company is governed, in particular, by the following principles: - a SEL, as any company operating a clinical laboratory, shall be registered on the national register of the _Ordre des médecins_ (French physicians order) and/or the _Ordre des pharmaciens_ (French pharmacists order) and is then also governed by the professional rules of ethics applicable to doctors and/or pharmacists; - the _président_ (president) and _dirigeants_ (i.e., the other corporate officers) of a SELAS shall be laboratory doctors who are shareholders of that SEL and who practice within that SEL; - more than half of the share capital and voting rights of a SEL shall be held, directly or indirectly (through specific companies), by laboratory doctors practicing within that SEL pursuant to the Law of December 31, 1990, on SELs, and article L. 6223-8, I, of the French Public Health Code. The remaining shares and voting rights of a SEL may be held by professionals practicing the same profession, which may be either natural persons (e.g., laboratory doctors who do not practice within this SEL) or legal entities (e.g., companies operating clinical laboratories). The Law of December 31, 1990, on SELs will be replaced as of September 1, 2024 by the Ordinance of February 8, 2023. SELs will be subject to Books I and III of Ordinance of February 8, 2023 and have until September 1, 2025 to comply with its provisions (with the exception of Article 44 (see below), which will apply as of September 1[st], 2024, and implementing decrees relating to requirements applicable to the shareholding and voting rights (the shareholders of the SEL will have two years after the date of the entry into force of said decrees to comply with their provisions). As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, this ordinance does not change the above-mentioned rules. In particular, Article 46 of the Ordinance of February 8, 2023 confirms the above-mentioned shareholding requirements and Article L. 6223-8 of the French Public Health Code was updated accordingly. Similarly, Article 61 of the same ordinance confirms that the president and other corporate officers of a SELAS shall be laboratory doctors who are shareholders of that SEL and practice within that SEL. The law applicable to SELs of biologists and pathologists may further change. On the one hand, the French Parliament could decide to revise the legislative provisions created by the Ordinance of February 8, 2023. In accordance with Article 7, II, of the law no. 2022-172 of February 14, 2022, the French Government filed on July 5, 2023 a bill that aims at ratifying the Ordinance of February 8, 2023. As of November 6, 2023, the French Parliament has not yet started to review this bill. The French Parliament could decide to amend the legislative provisions created by this Ordinance of February 8, 2023 during its ratification process or refuse to ratify this ordinance. On the other hand, the French Government needs to adopt implementing decrees in application of the Ordinance of February 8, 2023. The content of these decrees could affect the regulatory provisions applicable to SELs. These decrees cover a large number of subjects, including the communication of information by the SELs to the professional orders on the composition of the share capital and voting rights of the company (Article 44), rules on the so-called prohibited investors (Article 48), and rules on the percentage of the share capital of a SEL that may be held by a non-biologist shareholder (Article 70). Finally, ordinances, prior to the expiry of the deadline set for their ratification, may be challenged before the Council of State, which may annul them partially or totally. ----- Between this date and their ratification by the French Parliament, ordinances may be challenged before the Constitutional Council and/or the Council of State. Article 32 of Law No. 2001-1168 of December 11, 2001 (the ""MURCEF Law"") modified Law of December 31, 1990 by introducing therein an article 5-1 which effect was to open up to people outside SELs, namely laboratory doctors practicing outside the SEL or investment holdings of liberal practitioners (société de participations financières de professions libérales, or ""SPFPL""), the possibility to own more than half of the share capital of the SEL, while requiring that the majority of voting rights remain in the hands of laboratory doctors working in the SEL (this is the so-called ""5-1 derogation""). Subject to derogations (see below), Law of May 30, 2013 put an end to the applicability of this exemption (see paragraph I of Article L. 6223-8 of the French Public Health Code). However, pursuant to paragraph II of article L. 6223-8 of the French Public Health Code, SELs of laboratory doctors that had a different capital ownership structure when the Law of May 30, 2013 was promulgated (i.e., of which more than half of the share capital was held by persons other than laboratory doctors practicing within the SEL) benefit from a grandfathering exception that allows them to keep their existing structure, so that laboratory doctors who do not practice within these SELs and companies that operate clinical laboratories can continue to hold a majority stake in their share capital (but not in their voting rights). Thus, since 2013, so-called ""derogatory"" SELs and ""non-derogatory"" SELs coexist: - Non-derogatory SELs are either those created before the promulgation of Law of May 30, 2013 but which did not use the 5-1 derogation before this date, or those created since this date. The majority of the share capital of these SELs is therefore held, directly or indirectly, by laboratory doctors working within the SEL; - Derogatory SELs created prior to the promulgation of Law of May 30, 2013 which used the 5-1 derogation, and are therefore not directly or indirectly majority owned by laboratory doctors working within them. Paragraph II of article L. 6223-8 of the French Public Health Code gives the laboratory doctors practicing within the derogatory SELs who qualify for the grandfathering exception a priority right should shares of the SEL in which they practice be put up for sale. Article R. 6223-65 of the same Code specifies that, if the laboratory doctors practicing within the SEL cannot purchase the proposed shares or have not expressed their willingness to acquire the transferred shares by the end of a period of two months following the date of receipt of a notification sent to them by the legal representative of the company, such shares can be proposed to any natural person or legal entity practicing the profession of laboratory doctor or to any SPFPL (within the limit of 25% of the share capital, as mentioned below). The company's legal representative may not decide to sell to these aforementioned persons/entities at a more advantageous price or conditions without first emitting another offer to the benefit of the laboratory doctors practicing within the SEL in accordance with the above. In any case, a copy of the notification(s) is sent to the relevant Ordre and to the general director of the relevant ARS. Any sale of shares carried out in breach of the above is unenforceable _vis-à-vis the company, and its shareholders. All French SELs are derogatory ones, except for one (Bionyval), which will be merged early 2024. While the applicable regulation refers to sale of shares (cession), the competent administrative authorities could interpret this regime as preventing some forms of restructuring, such as those involving a universal transfer of all assets where the acquired SEL is not a derogatory SEL. Such interpretation, which seems to be the one adopted by the French Ministry of Health and Prevention, some ARSs and some trade unions, may make some forms of restructuring of SELs within the SYNLAB Group, or other mergers with SELs outside the SYNLAB Group, more complex or prevent them outright. Nevertheless, it is market practice for SELs covered by the grandfathering exception to absorb SELs that are not covered by it and consider that, as a result, the combined entity resulting from the merger keeps benefiting from the grandfathering exception. In an opinion no. 19-A-08 dated April 4, 2019, the French Competition Authority confirmed that ""a derogatory SEL may absorb a non-derogatory SEL, as a result of a merger, thus allowing all existing _derogatory structures to expand their chain of laboratories. A SEL which is absorbed by another is dissolved and integrated into the absorbing SEL, which results in the loss of its derogatory or non-_ ----- _derogatory status"" (point 1303) free translation). In addition, the Bordeaux administrative court of appeal_ clarified in a ruling issued in 2020 that (i) the ARS have, when certain authorizations are sought or modified in the course of a merger, to examine whether the contemplated operation would comply with all applicable provisions of the French Public Health Code, and (ii) the ARS cannot, in this context, refuse to grant such authorization or to modify it on the ground that the absorption, as a result of a merger, of a non-derogatory SEL by a derogatory SEL brings the laboratories at issue under the control of a SEL in which non-biologists hold a majority stake (CAA Bordeaux, 23 June 2020, case 18BX00491). In cases where a laboratory SEL fails to comply with the capital and voting rights requirements of the Law of December 31, 1990, the laboratory SEL must ensure its compliance within one year. Failing this, any interested party may ask the tribunal for the dissolution of the laboratory SEL. The tribunal may grant a maximum six-month delay to allow the laboratory SEL to meet the requirements for compliance. As a result of the entry into force of the Ordinance of February 8, 2023, this rule will apply in cases where a laboratory SEL fails to comply with the capital and voting rights or governance requirements set by Articles 56 to 67 of the Ordinance of February 8, 2023 (Article 53 of Ordinance of February 8, 2023). Law of December 31, 1990, on SELs was modified by the Macron Law. The purpose of the Macron Law was to modify the limitations of capital ownership and corporate governance of SELs other than clinical laboratory SELs (i.e., SELs of technicians and lawyers). However, the Macron Law also created ambiguities on the regime governing clinical laboratory SELs because it added the paragraph 6° to sublimb B of limb I of Article 5 of Law of December 31, 1990, under which the shares of a SEL that are not held by laboratory doctors working within the SEL may be held, apart notably from professionals practicing the same profession, by a laboratory company established in a Member State of the European Union/European Economic Area (EEA)/Swiss Confederation that notably ""complies, directly or indirectly _through another intermediary legal entity, with the requirements on holding of capital and voting rights provided by this Law"" (free translation) (i.e., Law of December 31, 1990). It cannot be excluded that this_ provision may be interpreted as prohibiting a corporate structuring, as the one developed by SYNLAB, where the majority of the share capital of the French SELs is held through European laboratory companies, if it is not demonstrated that these European laboratory companies comply with the restrictions on the holding of share capital and voting rights provided by French Law. The practical implications of this piece of legislation remain unclear, but it could be considered, notably, that this new provision should not apply to the SELs covered by the grandfathering exception, as is the case for SYNLAB. In the absence of a position from the administrative authorities or the judge (this argument was raised by the _Syndicat des _biologistes in the course of legal proceedings before the administrative court of Bordeaux, but only as an_ element of context and the ruling does not cover this point), the potential impact of the Macron Law on the current corporate structure of laboratory groups in France, including SYNLAB, remains undetermined. Under Article 47 of Ordinance of February 8, 2023, so-called ""European persons"" may own the rest of the share capital. A ""European person"" is defined, under Article 4 of the same ordinance, as a natural person or legal entity established in an EU Member State other than France, a party State to the EEA or in Swiss Confederation and which practices, in of these States, activity which presents the characteristics of a regulated profession within the meaning of the ordinance. If it is controlled, partially or totally, by another legal entity, it must respect the requirements provided under the ordinance as regards the holding of share capital and voting rights (Article 47 of Ordinance of February 8, 2023). natural persons or legal entities that are neither laboratory doctors, nor laboratory companies, cannot, pursuant to Article R. 6223-64 of the French Public Health Code, hold more than 25% of the share capital of a SELAS (this limit was confirmed by a decision of the European Court of Justice on 16 December 2010 (case C-89/09)); A cap limiting to two the number of SELs in which shares may be held by the same natural or legal person practicing, outside the SEL, the profession constituting the latter's corporate purpose or by professionals exercising a profession in the health profession other than the SEL's was formerly provided for by article R. 6212-81 of the Public Health Code, but was deleted by a decree of February 5, 2013 following the abovementioned ruling. According to Article 70 of Ordinance of February 8, 2023, decrees may provide that non laboratory doctors may collectively hold less than 50% of the share capital of SELAS, without being authorized to individually hold more than 25% of the share capital. As mentioned above, the French Government has not yet adopted the relevant decree. This future decree will replace the current regulatory provisions set by Article R. 622364 of the French Public Health Code. - finally, to prevent any conflict of interest, Article L. 6223-5 of the French Public Health Code forbids the following persons (the ""prohibited investors""), from holding, whether directly or indirectly, a ----- fraction of the share capital of a private company operating a French clinical laboratory (and not only SELs): (i) a natural or legal person practicing as a healthcare practitioner (except for laboratory doctors), or operating as provider, distributor or manufacturer of medical devices or in vitro diagnostic medical devices, or operating as a private healthcare institution or as a social or medico-social institution governed by private law, or operating as an insurance or capitalization company or as a welfare, retirement or mandatory or elective social security institution; (ii) an natural or legal person holding 10% or more of the share capital of a company which provides, distributes or manufactures medical devices or in vitro diagnostic medical devices, or which operates as an insurance or capitalization company or as a, welfare, retirement or mandatory or elective social security institution; and (iii) any natural or legal person holding, whether directly or indirectly, a fraction of the share capital of a company of healthcare practitioners which is authorized to take samples under the conditions mentioned under Article L. 6211-13 of the French Public Health Code and which does not meet the conditions of chapter II of title I of book II (""Clinical testing"") of part 6 of the legislative part of the French Public Health Code (i.e., articles L. 6212-1 to L. 6212-6 of the French Public Health Code on the qualification of a clinical laboratory). Ordinance of February 8, 2023 did not change the provisions of Article L. 6223-5 of the French Public Health Code. _Rules Governing Anatomical Pathology Laboratories_ Lastly, it should be noted that SELs that operate anatomical pathology laboratories are SELs of medical doctors, and are therefore subject to substantially similar rules to those applicable to the SELs which operate clinical laboratories. In particular, the restrictions on ownership and corporate governance structure are relatively similar. In this respect, it is noteworthy that, in order to prevent certain conflicts of interest, any equity interest (whether direct or indirect) in SELs that operate anatomical pathology laboratories is also prohibited for various categories of natural persons and legal entities. This prohibition includes laboratory doctors and companies operating clinical laboratories. To comply with this regulation, we have set up a corporate structure that enables us to hold SELs that operate anatomical pathology laboratories through some of our subsidiaries that are not affected by this prohibition. A key difference with the SELs which operate clinical laboratories is that, to date, the majority of the share capital (but not of the voting rights) of SELs that operate anatomical pathology laboratories may be held by physicians not practicing in these SELs or companies of physicians. There is no need to rely on derogatory SELs or a grandfathering exception. In addition, physicians and SELs of physicians can only be shareholders of two SELs.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,58,REGULATION,58.2,France,58.2.2,Impact of Regulations Applicable to Our Corporate Structure,"Our French subsidiaries that operate clinical laboratories (in the form of SELAS) are held directly and indirectly through an Italian laboratory company, and our foreign subsidiaries are held indirectly through several national holding companies and other laboratory companies. In France, as described above, ownership of the share capital and voting rights of SELs operating clinical laboratories and their corporate governance structure are highly regulated. In particular, the majority of voting rights of the SELs must be held by laboratory doctors practicing within these SELs. In order to comply with this regulation, we have put in place: (i) a corporate structure under which we hold about 99.9% of the share capital of the SELs benefiting from the grandfathering exception under the Law of May 30, 2013, described above, directly or indirectly through Istituto il Baluardo S.p.A. (an Italian subsidiary), while some of the laboratory doctors practicing in these SELs hold the remaining shares; and ----- (ii) the articles of association (statuts) of all of our SELs grant the majority of voting rights at all shareholders' general meetings to laboratory doctors who are shareholders in the SELs in which they practice. We can no longer use this approach for most of our acquisitions implemented as from the enactment of the Law of May 30, 2013, which has made it mandatory for more than 50% of the share capital (in addition to 50% of voting rights) of a SEL of laboratory doctors to be held by the laboratory doctors practicing in the SEL. We have therefore set up an alternative structure, based on issuing preferred shares within the SYNLAB Group, in order to make acquisitions in compliance with the regulation, while enabling us to hold virtually all the economic rights in the acquired SELs and to exercise determining influence over them. Therefore, in all cases, we hold virtually all of the economic rights in the SELs and have put in place corporate governance, contractual and organizational structures, in compliance with French regulation, that allow us to fully consolidate these SELs in our financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,58,REGULATION,58.2,France,58.2.3,Impact of the Regulation on the Corporate Governance of the SELs,"The laboratory doctors from whom we acquire a minority stake in SELs (whether such SELs benefit from the grandfathering exception or not) or clinical laboratories who decide to stay in the SYNLAB Group, continue to run the SELs on a day-to-day basis. In order to improve the coordination of operations in our clinical laboratories and consolidate our network, we have set up a resource sharing structure in the form of a French GIE (Groupement d'intérêt économique), SYNLAB Gestion, which encompasses all of our existing French laboratory companies and some of its foreign companies, including SYNLAB Diagnósticos Globales, S.A., SYNLAB Belgium SRL (a Belgian laboratory company) and Istituto il Baluardo S.p.A. (one of the Italian laboratory companies). The GIE provides administrative support for the clinical laboratories of its members. The GIE is managed by SYNLAB France as its sole director, appointed by a qualified (i.e., three-quarters majority) vote of the GIE's members. In strict compliance with French regulations governing clinical laboratories, in 2014 we began to set up a new corporate governance, contractual and organizational structure for our French SEL subsidiaries allowing us to fully consolidate these subsidiaries in our financial statements. Not all SELs have adopted this governance scheme, but a significant number have. This structure is based on a set of standard agreements (the ""Operating Rules"") These Operating Rules give us the ability to de facto exercise relevant influence on the SELs' strategic and financial operations, while strictly complying with the regulation requiring that the laboratory doctors who practice in a SEL (the _associés professionnels internes_ or APIs) hold the majority of the voting rights (50.01%) of such a SEL. Furthermore, shareholders' agreements entered into with the APIs define the commitments that the APIs accept, including an obligation to sell their shares in the SEL when they quit practicing, and a commitment to fully participate in our development and restructuring. We exercise a determining influence over the day-to-day management of the SELs through Strategy Committees (Comités Stratégiques) that are set up pursuant to the shareholders' agreements. Such influence relies on corporate governance mechanisms and contractual agreements put in place in accordance with applicable laws. These Strategy Committees ensure the implication of representatives of the SYNLAB Group in strategic and financial decisions. Given the contractual commitments accepted by the API parties to the shareholders' agreements, which includes membership of GIE SYNLAB Gestion and utilization of our central support services (e.g., accounting, finance and legal services, purchasing, IT, human resources, scientific information and quality control), decisions proposed by us are intended to be adopted by consensus, with a favorable vote from the APIs who are members of the Strategy Committee. We note that the shareholders' agreements expressly provide that the commitments accepted by the APIs shall in no way affect their professional independence and that we expressly undertake not to intervene in the regulated clinical laboratory activities exercised under the sole responsibility of the APIs. We therefore do not, and will never, intervene in the SELs' purely medical practice, which is under the sole responsibility of the laboratory doctors. ----- In case of a deadlock, which should be analyzed for the sole purpose of justifying full consolidation under IFRS, we may use specific mechanisms provided for in the Operating Rules, where applicable. We are not in a position to fully assess whether the mechanisms for ending a deadlock situation would consist of any infringement of the principle of professional independence. However, in accordance with the regulation, the documentation underlying the legal and organizational structure is systematically sent to the supervisory authorities (professional Ordres and competent ARS) when adopted by a SEL. Consequently, the supervisory authorities ensure that the operation of the clinical laboratories complies with the regulations, and the professional Ordres ensure that it complies with the applicable ethical rules. To date, none of the Operating Rules as summarized above has been challenged in any way by the supervisory authorities. Lastly, it should be noted in this respect that certain other legal organizational methods adopted in the past by our SELs were criticized and sanctioned by the Governing Board of the Ordre des pharmaciens. We contested these sanctions and filed a complaint with the European Commission in 2007. It is mainly on this ground that the European Commission found that the Ordre des pharmaciens had sought to prevent the development of laboratory groups in the French market, in violation of European Union rules on collusion and restrictive commercial practices, and ordered it to pay a very substantial fine in December 2010. This ruling was confirmed by a decision of the European Court of Justice on December 10, 2014. On March 5, 2015, the Conseil Central de la Section G, which is the body of the Ordre des pharmaciens responsible for clinical testing, closed several disciplinary cases against us during an administrative session without taking any further action. The closing of these cases results from a withdrawal of the complaints filed by its president against our medical doctors and SELs. Even though these withdrawals were not motivated by any external action, they are probably the result of the decision of the Ordre des Pharmaciens to not appeal its conviction by the European General Court. We had introduced an action against the Ordre des Pharmaciens before the administrative tribunal of Paris to ask for compensation for the prejudice suffered as a result of the anti-competitive practices of the _Ordre des Pharmaciens that were criticized by the European Commission. A transaction protocol was signed with the Ordre des Pharmaciens and the Conseil Central _de la Section G on December 26, 2017, allowing us to put the action introduced before the administrative_ tribunal of Paris to an end. Separately, a professional union of biologists summoned in March 2022 the SEL Synlab Paris and the company Synlab France to appear before the Paris judicial court. This union seeks before the Paris judicial court the judicial winding-up of the SEL Synlab Paris on the ground that the shareholding of this SEL would be in breach of Article L. 6223-5. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the court proceedings are still ongoing. Finally, the Council of State (French highest administrative court) issued on 10 July 2023 three rulings in the veterinary sector in relation to laws and regulations that are close to those applicable to SELs of biologists and physicians. In these rulings, the Council of State ruled that, the fact that, by requiring that APIs hold half of the share capital and voting rights of the veterinary companies in which they practice, French law requires that the APIs effectively control said companies. According to press statements, a conciliation process is ongoing to clarify the meaning and implications of these rulings for groups of veterinary clinics. The Council of State moreover endorsed an interpretation of the legislative provisions that prohibit certain categories of persons from holding, whether directly or indirectly, a fraction of the share capital of veterinary companies which implies that one is deemed to indirectly hold a participation in a veterinary clinic if it controls the intermediate entity which ultimately holds the participation in the said clinic. Although these decisions are not related to the human health sector, nor based on the Law of December 31, 1990 or the French Public Health Code, SYNLAB cannot exclude that these interpretations may be transposed by French courts, administrative authorities or professional orders to the medical biology and pathology sectors, which could reinforce the position of SYNLAB when it comes to Article L. 6223-5 and Article R. 4113-13 but negatively affect the above-mentioned governance mechanisms. This specific legal and organizational structure that we currently use, as well as the arrangements described above, entail certain risks. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment— _The French regulatory environment in which we operate is particularly stringent, especially in relation to ownership and corporate structure of SELs (Société d'Exercice Liberal), particularly those operating clinical laboratories. If regulators were to successfully challenge our existing legal structure, this could have a material adverse impact on our activities.""_ -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,58,REGULATION,58.3,Germany,58.3.1,Laboratory Diagnostics,"In Germany, the health insurance system distinguishes between statutory health insurance (Gesetzliche _Krankenversicherung, ""SHI"") and the private health insurance (Private Krankenversicherung, ""PHI"")._ Approximately 90% of the German population is covered by SHI. The following discussion focuses on our services for SHI patients and SHI reimbursement. Outpatient medical services, including clinical laboratory testing services, to patients insured through SHI must be provided either by physicians who are licensed by administrative order (Vertragsärzte) or by certain non-physician service providers who are licensed by contract with the respective patient's SHI fund. The services must be conducted under the personal supervision and control of such qualified specialists (Prinzip der persönlichen Leistungserbringung). We provide our laboratory testing services primarily by medical care centers (Medizinische _Versorgungszentren, ""MVZ"") employing qualified physicians. Alternatively, laboratory work may be_ provided through independent (freiberuflich) office-based physicians, working as sole practitioners or in collaboration with other qualified physicians. In addition, clinical laboratory services providers can enter into outsourcing or other cooperation agreements to provide clinical laboratory services to hospitals. To obtain SHI admission (vertragsärztliche Zulassung) and to thereby provide medical services to patients insured under the SHI scheme, MVZs have to meet certain specific eligibility requirements: - Under the previous law, each MVZ is required to offer multidisciplinary services (fachübergreifende _Tätigkeit), which de facto requires the presence of at least two physicians with different areas of_ specialization at the same site. Pursuant to a bill which entered into force on July 23, 2015, the operation of an MVZ no longer requires multidisciplinary services. Under the new regulation, MVZs may be founded and continued with at least two physicians who may practice in the same discipline. - As it is usually the case, our physicians are employees of the MVZ, however, the law also allows them to maintain their status as SHI physicians. The employment of a physician at the MVZ must be approved by way of an administrative order issued by the licensing committee. - A qualified and licensed SHI physician who works at the MVZ must be free in his medical decision and observe the requirement of personal service provision (Gebot der persönlichen _Leistungserbringung). The articles of association of each MVZ operating company must specify that_ shareholders may not instruct physicians acting in their medical capacity. - In every MVZ there must be a medical director (ärztlicher Leiter), either an employed physician or a SHI physician, who is solely responsible for the organization of the entire operational processes from a medical perspective. The medical director must be free from instructions in medical matters. - MVZs licensed in or after 2012 must be organized in one of the following legal forms: a general partnership under German civil law (GbR), a registered partnership (Partnerschaftsgesellschaft), a registered cooperative (eingetragene Genossenschaft), a legal form under public law or a limited liability company (GmbH). - MVZs that obtained their license before 2012 benefit from a grandfathering provision pursuant to section 95 paragraph 1a of the Social Security Code V (Sozialgesetzbuch Fünftes Buch, ""SGB V""). The grandfathering rule only refers to the status quo of the MVZ (i.e., the legal form and shareholder structure of a MVZ may only be amended into a legal form and shareholder structure which is permissible under the new law). - Several of our MVZs benefit from the aforementioned grandfathering provisions. This concerns MVZs established under the former legal regime as direct subsidiaries of the holding company. In contrast, MVZs that are directly held by Steinlach-Klinik GmbH, which is the owner of a contract hospital (Krankenhaus mit Versorgungsvertrag), are governed by the current regulations. - Since 2012, MVZs may only be founded and their shares held by, among others, SHI-authorized physicians, SHI-authorized hospitals, licensed non-physician dialysis service providers and non-profit ----- providers already licensed to provide services to SHI patients. As investors do not qualify as one of the aforementioned eligible shareholders of MVZ, they are only able to indirectly establish and operate an MVZ (e.g., by acting through non-physician dialysis healthcare service providers or through an authorized or contract hospital), which, in turn, are not limited by similar ownership restrictions. Since May 2019, providers of non-physician dialysis services are only allowed to set up an MVZ operating in the same area of medical specialization. However, MVZs established by non-physician dialysis service providers existing and authorized before May 11, 2019 benefit from grandfathering. Moreover, since 2019, networks of physicians and municipalities are also authorized to establish an MVZ. - Prior to 2012, any healthcare service provider licensed to provide services to SHI patients was entitled to establish an MVZ entity. For MVZs licensed prior to 2012 that have been established by a healthcare service provider which was no longer eligible under the regulatory regime applicable after the legislative changes of 2012, the grandfathering provision under section 95 paragraph 1a SGB V is also applicable. Grandfathering protection ceases after six months if new shareholders participate in the MVZ entity that would have not been permitted as shareholders prior to 2012 (section 95 paragraph 6 SGB V). - Shareholders of an MVZ operating in the legal form of a GmbH must provide a directly enforceable guarantee (selbstschuldnerische Bürgschaft) for potential claims of the SHI physicians' associations (kassenärztliche Vereinigungen) and SHI funds against the MVZ entity relating to the MVZ's operation as a SHI healthcare provider. The obligations of the guarantor are strictly accessory to the obligations of the MVZ as principal debtor and are not subject to priority claims by the beneficiaries of these guarantees. We believe that all German MVZs we own have obtained the relevant admissions. Since 2019, various demands, including legislative proposals, requesting the enactment of stricter regulations targeting investor owned MVZs have shaped the public debate. The out-patient market is traditionally dominated by private practitioners and it is argued by certain political and healthcare stakeholders in Germany that the healthcare system should be better protected against financial investors which are allegedly primarily interested in financial results and not so much in the best and cost-efficient treatment of out-patients. The most recent discussions led to a resolution which was published on June 16, 2023, by the German Federal Council (Bundesrat) and which deals with the proposed creation of a MVZ regulation. The key elements of the proposed new regulation restricting the ownership of MVZs by hospitals are as follows: - Restriction of the founding status of hospitals: MVZs may only be founded by a hospital in those planning areas related to groups of physicians that are wholly or partially within a 50 km radius of the sponsoring hospital. The regulation should provide for exceptions for underserved areas. - Avoidance of monopolies: The supply share for all MVZs founded and held by a given hospital is to be limited as follows: in the respective planning area for a specific group of physicians, 25% for general practitioners and 50% for specialists; in the entire KV district, 5% for general practitioners and 10% for specialists. The regulation is intended to provide exceptions for underserved areas. In effect, this would mean a cap on the total proportion of SHI-accredited physician seats available for a hospital-based MVZ structure in a given area. The resolution of the Federal Council represents the most recent of various political signals without, however, having any direct influence on a legislative process, as resolutions of the Federal Council are not legally binding. It is expected that the proposed draft regulation, which has been announced by the Federal Ministry of Health since the beginning of 2023 will be published in the course of the first quarter 2024. It is not clear and not predictable whether the legislative proposals will be close to the considerations of the Federal Council as the Ministry of Health is refusing any comment on the envisaged content of the proposed new legislation. Coincidentally with a potential reform of MVZ regulation, the German hospital system is under scrutiny in terms of over-capacity and the need for consolidation. It is expected that such consolidation would lead to a decrease of the number of hospital beds and to the shut-down of contract hospitals (that might also affect hospitals which are currently operating MVZs). This will most probably affect small hospitals with a low number of beds as they usually are considered inefficient. The corresponding political discussions are at an ----- early stage, and thus the outcome of, and in particular the combined effect of, both legislative initiatives cannot be foreseen. The admission of outpatient medical service providers for SHI services is generally, depending on the respective medical field, subject to capacity planning (Bedarfsplanung) on a state-by-state basis, which means that admission is restricted in certain areas of medical specialization. Under this scheme, which was subject to significant amendments in 2013, SHI admission in restricted areas, whether through individual practice or as an employee in an MVZ, is only granted if the applicant already holds a planned position (Kassenarztsitz, or Arztstelle in a MVZ) in that state or takes over the practice of physician who holds an existing planned position. The replacement of a planned position generally requires a formal public procurement proceeding prior to the transfer of a planned position to another physician. For an MVZ, additional rules apply. An MVZ may generally be allowed to replace an employed doctor who leaves the MVZ. When a physician in individual practice abandons his or her planned position to work in an MVZ, according to current applicable laws, the licensing committee has to consent to such employment. The anticipated reform of MVZ regulation might potentially affect the underlying statutory provision. While previously exempted, laboratory specialists also became subject to capacity planning in 2013. In the outpatient sector, different price and compensation levels exist under the SHI and PHI systems. In the SHI system, a uniform assessment standard _Einheitlicher Bewertungsmaßstab, (""EBM"") for compensation of medical services has been established at the federal level. The EBM is mandatory in the SHI scheme and the fees for laboratory services are laid down in chapter 32. Payments are distributed and effected at the state level by state associations of SHI physicians (kassenärztliche Vereinigungen). The distribution system has undergone some changes during the last years. In the second half of 2012, the German Federal Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (Kassenärztliche _Bundesvereinigung, or national KV) implemented a central federal quota (i.e., a capped percentage of the_ scheduled EBM fees) for laboratory tests. Contrary to the former system, whereby quotas on scheduled compensations were managed at the regional level, under the new national EBM funding structure quotas were calculated nationwide and in advance for each quarter with the general objective of limiting the recent significant increase in laboratory testing expenses in Germany. The quota for the fourth quarter of 2012 was 95.4%. It decreased for the first quarter of 2013 to 89.2%. The quota in 2015 was 91.58% and it remained unchanged for 2016. The quota system has been modified again by a new laboratory reform act which entered into force in April 2018. Under the new law, quota will be calculated again at a regional level by the regional state associations of SHI physicians. However, such regional quota shall not underrun a minimum quota of 89%. The same applies to the modified calculation of the bonus for cost-efficient treatments which shall equally not fall below 89%. However, future tariff reductions cannot be excluded. There has already been a decision by the Federal Social Court (Bundessozialgericht) that confirmed the permissibility of introducing quotas into the reimbursement system for laboratory services. In the PHI system, a binding scale of fees for physicians (Gebührenordnung für Ärzte, ""GOÄ"") has been enacted by the Federal Ministry of Health. While it cannot be excluded that a GOÄ reform would be agreed upon in the current legislative period (i.e., before 2025), it should be noted that such reform would require years of implementation following approval. Special contracts (Selektivverträge) between SHI funds and clinical laboratories are permitted in the German clinical laboratory services market, and lower prices may be agreed in exchange for volume guarantees. Prices for services provided to hospitals by clinical laboratory services operators under outsourcing or other cooperation contracts are subject to negotiation or public procurement and are not directly regulated. A recurring element of the political debate is the introduction of a citizens' insurance scheme (Bürgerversicherung), which would abolish the distinction between private and statutory health insurances and could therefore also lead to considerable changes in the compensation of medical services. However, this appears rather unlikely in the short and medium term.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,58,REGULATION,58.4,Italy,58.4.1,,"The Italian healthcare system has been reformed taking into account the need of ensuring cost efficiency in relation to enhancement of qualitative level of healthcare services, while also considering the peculiarity of the regions involved. The most important regulation is that set forth in Legislative Decree December 30, 1992, no. 502, as subsequently modified, among others, by Legislative Decree December 7, 1993, no. 517 (the ""Healthcare **Legislative Decree""). The Italian healthcare system is decentralized and entails a strong involvement of regions. In particular, the state is the one responsible for providing guidelines as to the functioning of the whole systems, establishing the goals to be attained by regions. Such goals are reflected in the National Healthcare Plan (Piano Sanitario Nazionale), which lays out, inter alia, the minimal and uniform levels of healthcare assistance to be granted to the population and updated every three years. The regions administer powers entrusted by national and regional laws, implement the National Healthcare Plan by adopting or implementing specific regional healthcare plans and providing regulations as to the delivery of health services and establishing criteria for allocating healthcare budgets, taking into account the needs and peculiarities of local territorial entities. As to these latter entities, provinces oversee enacting hygiene, environmental and preventive measures on the relevant territory. Municipalities are mainly dedicated to administrative functions. Decisions in the public sector are enacted on both a national and regional basis level in conformity with the Italian Constitution, (in Italian: competenza concorrente, shared competence, pursuant to Article 117 of the Italian Constitution). National laws and regulations provide a general framework for healthcare policy and regional healthcare budgets. They also set indicative prices for diagnostic services tests. Each region must implement regional healthcare system in compliance with the national legal framework and is responsible for its own annual healthcare budget and for allocating funds to regional health authorities. In turn, regional health authorities allocate funds to both public healthcare facilities and the private facilities meeting the requirements described below. To operate in the public healthcare system and receive financings and reimbursements from public authorities, both public and private healthcare facilities must, cumulatively: (i) obtain authorization for the construction and operation from the competent local authority - municipality or province or region, depending upon the region involved (under Article 8-ter of the Healthcare Legislative Decree), which is issued if the facilities meet certain minimum requirements (structural, technological and organizational) set out at regional and municipal level; (ii) obtain accreditation from the competent authority for each healthcare facility (under Article 8-quater of the Healthcare Legislative Decree) which, depending on the regional legislation, may be issued by either the region or the regional health authority if the healthcare services meet certain specific quality standards, additional to those provided for the attainment of the authorization under point (i) established by the regions; (iii) enter into agreements with the regional health ----- authorities for the number and type of services that each facility can provide (under Article 8-quinquies of the Healthcare Legislative Decree). Maintaining the agreements with the public authorities is likely to become more difficult in the future since it could be requested that the health structure carry out a minimum number of tests per year. The Healthcare Legislative Decree also regulates the procedures to be complied with as to the authorization requests, the accreditation, the execution of the agreement and the thresholds for the reimbursement for healthcare. While the authorization is the measure by which private and public health facilities are granted with the possibility of providing healthcare services in Italy, the accreditation acknowledged those facilities, that have been previously authorized, as providers within and on behalf of the national or regional health service, allowing them with the possibility to enter into agreements and have access to healthcare services budget. In certain regions, new accreditations are currently limited, therefore new providers currently cannot enter into agreements with regional healthcare authorities and new facilities cannot be opened. Authorized private operators can open new facilities and operate as non-accredited laboratories with the public healthcare system. In certain regions, such as Lombardy, new requirements for the authorization and accreditation of laboratories have been approved, providing a term for the operators to comply with and from March 1, 2023, the laboratories that request new authorizations must immediately meet all the minimum structural and organizational requirements (DGR n. XI/7044/2022). Generally, such administrative authorization is granted to private individuals or the company, duly represented, that own non-accredited laboratory. Any change of ownership in a non-accredited laboratory must be notified to the region and requires the new owner to obtain administrative authorization to operate (or the step-in into the authorization of the previous holder). The same applies to accredited healthcare facilities. Public and private healthcare facilities, including clinical laboratories, are generally subject to the following requirements: (i) adequacy of personnel in respect of the activity; (ii) specific professional qualifications of managers and certain other staff members (e.g., the chief medical officer (direttore sanitario) must be a qualified doctor and a member of the relevant professional association of doctors); (iii) technical, structural and operational conditions must be met; and (iv) providing that requirements are met, legal entities or natural persons operating the facilities must receive authorization from the relevant regional health authority. These requirements are set out at regional level based on the general framework provided at national level under Presidential Decree D.P.R. of January 14, 1997. Private clinical laboratory operators can self-certify that all requirements are met by filing a declaration of commencement of activity (e.g., Certified declaration of commencement of activity (Segnalazione _Certificata di Inizio Attivita)) with the local regional health authority, so as the regional health authority_ verifies the accuracy of the information provided in such declaration of commencement of activity. In addition to that, as mentioned above, clinical laboratories that intend to operate in the public healthcare system must obtain accreditation by enrolling in the register of accredited facilities and being entitled to enter into agreements with the regional health authorities. Even though most of the regions do not restrict or limit the ownership of laboratories, some of them (e.g., Campania, Latium, Abruzzo and Liguria) started a reorganization of the private accredited laboratories based, inter alia, on the introduction of a minimum test volume threshold (soglia minima di efficienza) to be performed by private accredited laboratories or by an aggregated consortium of private accredited laboratories. A hub-and-spoke system is to be implemented among public laboratories, to which accredited healthcare facilities can participate, depending on what set forth by the relevant region. Additionally, the types and target numbers of tests per laboratory have been defined. The reorganization of the private accredited laboratories is based, inter alia, on the introduction of a minimum test volume threshold to be performed by private accredited laboratories or by aggregations of private accredited laboratories. The national healthcare system ensures the provision of health services included in the ""Essential Levels of Care"" (Livelli Essenziali di Assistenza) through the activity of public providers and accredited private providers, with whom the regions enter into agreements for the reimbursement. All the providers under the national healthcare system are paid according to prices established at the regional level, within the framework of the reference legislation set at the national level to ensure the homogeneity of the system. Accordingly, different prices are applied by the various regions. Regional health authorities are also in charge of reimbursing healthcare facilities and are bound by the regulatory framework implemented by their region. Moreover, with respect to patients covered by private insurance, prices are set by an agreement between private insurance companies and healthcare facilities. The Italian Ministry of Health has issued a new Decree of 23 June 2023, which has revised the tariffs, among others, for laboratory services. ----- Health services advertising has been liberalized through Law Decree No. 223/2006 with respect to the operations of sole practitioners, professional associations of doctors and medical service providers established in the form of companies (including healthcare facilities, such as clinical laboratories). Advertising in medical services must comply with certain provisions of law, with deontological regulations and with the guidelines issued by medical professional associations. In addition to that, covert and deceptive advertising is always forbidden. Laboratories are also subject to specific environmental and hazardous waste management regulations (inter alia_ Presidential Decree no. 254/2003 providing rules on medical waste and Legislative Decree no. 152/2006 the ""Italian Environmental Code""). Failure to comply with such regulatory framework may result in administrative and criminal liability, including monetary fines, full or partial suspension of the operation, obligation to compensate damages and clean up obligations. Italian laws and regulations provide specifically for data protection requirements in connection with genetic testing, including requirements for security measures (e.g., certified e-mails and coding, biometric tools compliant with the applicable regulation), detailed information about the scope and purposes of the genetic tests, and genetic counseling and wherever possible genetic data shall go through encryption and pseudonymization procedures. Furthermore, for the safekeeping and security of genetic data, a dedicated procedure for identifying access to the premises of persons authorized to process personal data must be adopted and a person responsible to monitor access should be appointed. In addition to that, private and public healthcare facilities must comply with the general data protection regulation. Public healthcare structures and contracting entities are generally required to launch public tender procedures to enter into contracts with third parties for works, services and supplies (as provided under Legislative Decree no. 50/2016 and, currently, by the Legislative Decree no. 36/2023 effective from 1 July 2023 ""Italian Code on Public Procurement""). Case-law has stated that the Italian Code on Public Procurement does not apply to private accredited structures (Counsil of State, sez. III, 19 March 2018, n. 1739). Italian Law Decree No. 21/2012 (as converted into law by Law no. 56/2012, and as subsequently amended and implemented through specific Law Decrees, Presidential Decrees and Decrees of the President of the Council of Ministers, the ""Golden Power Law"") grants to the Italian Government the power (the ""Golden",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Then, such company would have 15 days to possibly file briefs and observations. A ""subject external to the European Union,"" as referenced in paragraph (2)(b) above, means (a) any natural person who does not have the citizenship of a member state of the European Union; (b) any natural person ----- who has the citizenship of a member state of the European Union and who does not have the residence, the habitual abode or the main center of activity in a member state of the European Union or of the European Economic Area or who is not otherwise established therein; (c) any legal person who does not have the registered office or the administration or the main center of activity in a member state of the European Union or of the European Economic Area or who is not otherwise established therein; (d) any legal person who has established the registered office or the administration or the main center of activity in a member state of the European Union or of the European Economic Area, or who is otherwise established therein, and who is controlled, directly or indirectly, by a natural person or by a legal person referred to in letters (a), (b) and (c); (e) any natural person or legal person who has the citizenship of a member state of the European Union or of the European Economic Area who has established the residence, the habitual abode, the registered office or the administration or the main center of activity in a member state of the European Union, or who is otherwise established therein, where there are elements that indicate an evasive behavior with respect to the application of the rules set out Golden Power Law. Upon receipt of the filing, a 45-day waiting period (which can be extended twice and for an aggregate period of up to 30 days, if additional information is deemed necessary by the Italian government on top of that already provided, the ""Waiting Period"") begins, during which the Italian Government analyses the relevant resolution or transaction and resolves as to whether to exercise or not the relevant Golden Power. In case the cooperation mechanism provided for under EU Regulation 2019/452 is triggered, the Waiting Period can be extended up to 115 calendar days in aggregate. If the Italian Government does not provide clearance or exercise its Golden Power before the expiry of the Waiting Period, the resolution or transaction is deemed to be cleared through the so called silent-consent mechanism, although this happens very rarely. Until the Italian Government completes its review (or until the application is filed): (a) the relevant corporate resolution cannot be implemented, and (b) the voting rights attached to the acquired shares are suspended. In case of non-compliance with the decision issued by the Italian Government or with the duty to file, (i) the relevant resolution is null and void, (ii) the relevant acquisition can be vetoed or made subject to conditions also post-closing, and (iii) the perpetrators can be subject to administrative fines up to two times the deal value and not less than 1% of the aggregate turnover (as per the last financial statements) of the involved entities. Should specific reasons of national security/national interests be assessed, the Italian Government has the power to: (i) veto corporate resolutions concerning companies holding Strategic Assets and resulting in a change of ownership, control (in the defense sector, potentially also in favor of an Italian entity) or purpose of such Strategic Assets, as well as transactions entailing the acquisition of relevant participations by nonEU entities (or in the communications, energy, transport, health, agro-food or finance (including credit and insurance) sectors, in case of acquisition of control by a EU entity) over a company owning Strategic Assets, and (ii) impose conditions (and subsequently monitor compliance with such conditions) on any of the above corporate resolutions and transactions, in relation to the security of supplies and information, the transfer of technologies, and export controls. The Golden Power can be exercised only if the relevant resolutions or transactions could result in a serious threat to the safety of the relevant Strategic Assets or to the essential interests of defense and national security, safety and operation of strategic networks and installations, continuity of supplies, and safety and public order. In particular, the veto power can be exercised only if the threat cannot be addressed by imposing conditions on the relevant resolution or transaction. The procedure above is slightly different for the 5G sector (point 3) above). In this case, the filing of the ""purchase plan"" must be made annually and the Waiting Period amounts to 30 days, that can be extended up to 40 days. The cooperation mechanism under EU Regulation 2019/452 does not apply. Finally, Law Decree No. 21 of 22 March 2022, together with the Decree of the President of the Council of Ministers No. 189 of 1 September 2022 have recently introduced the ""pre-notification"" procedure. When there is uncertainty as to whether a transaction may fall within the scope of the Golden Power Law, this pre-notification procedure is available, by way of which any interested company can submit to the Presidency of the Council of Ministers a so-called ""project"" of the transaction and hear back within 30 days. Within such timeframe, the Government must clarify if the transaction falls or not within the scope of application of the Golden Power Law. The Government may also decide that while the transaction falls within the scope of application of the Golden Power Law, no filing will be due. Should no response be issued within the 30 days, filing will be due. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,58,REGULATION,58.6,United Kingdom,58.6.1,,"In the United Kingdom, there is no specific regulation related to the ownership of a company operating clinical laboratories. Authorization to operate a clinical laboratory may, however, be suspended if the person responsible for managing the clinical laboratory's provision of services to the NHS on a day to day basis (the clinical laboratory's ""registered manager""), fails the ""fit and proper persons test."" Since the implementation of a particular measure in April 2015, the Care Quality Commission has been able to apply findings of failure of the test more firmly against registered managers. Further, in the event the clinical laboratory holds a contract with the NHS, it must hold a valid NHS Provider License. A requirement before an NHS Provider License is issued is for the corporate directors and the directors of any parent companies to make a declaration to satisfy a ""fit and proper person test."" This is a separate requirement to that mentioned in the aforementioned paragraph (above). In order to run a clinical laboratory in the United Kingdom, several authorizations and accreditations are required. First, the company must register with the Care Quality Commission under the Health & Social Care Act 2008 as a service provider; it must also register the address of every one of its laboratories. If the company is already registered, it must apply to register any additional laboratories. Every laboratory must also have a registered manager who supervises operations, quality, safety and compliance rules. While clinical laboratories are not legally required to hold a UKAS accreditation, it is widely acknowledged that holding this accreditation provides assurance to the marketplace and regulators that the laboratories have met the relevant ISO standards and are periodically monitored for compliance. UKAS accreditation is a contractual requirement to work with the NHS. Lastly, according to the type of operation involved, certain specific authorizations may be required. For example, an authorization from the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is necessary for blood transfusions. Biomedical scientists must be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC). There is no legal requirement for a minimum number of biomedical scientists in a laboratory, however, the Institute of Biomedical Science (IBMS) provides guidance on staffing and workload for clinical diagnostic laboratory services. The adoption of the Health & Social Care Act 2012 started an overhaul of the organization of the NHS and the way in which budgets are allocated. This supports and facilitates agreements between the NHS and the private sector. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of Note Guarantees and security where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, ""thin capitalization"" rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, where the time and cost of granting the guarantee or security would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the holders or where security would be granted over the capital stock, property or other assets, or liabilities of a member of the Group. In this ""Agreed Security Principles"" section only, any reference to ""Security,"" ""Finance Documents,"" ""Security Agent,"" ""Transaction Security Document,"" ""Finance Parties,"" ""Obligor,"" ""Declared Default,"" ""Declared RCF Default,"" ""Acquired Person or Asset,"" ""Acquired Indebtedness,"" ""Permitted Indebtedness,"" ""Permitted Liens,"" ""Facilities,"" ""Lender,"" ""Material Subsidiaries,"" ""Guarantor Jurisdiction"" and ""Arranger"" is a reference to that term as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement and the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement as in effect on the Issue Date. _General Principles_ The Agreed Security Principles embody the recognition by all parties that there may be certain legal and practical difficulties in obtaining effective or commercially reasonable guarantees and/or Security from relevant members of the Group in each jurisdiction in which it has been agreed that the Note Guarantees and Security will be granted. In particular: (1) general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, capital maintenance rules, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, ""transfer pricing,"" ""thin capitalization,"" ""earnings stripping,"" ""controlled foreign corporation"" and other tax restrictions, ""exchange control restrictions,"" ""capital maintenance"" rules and ""liquidity impairment"" rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or Security or may require that the guarantee or Security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the guarantee or Security will be limited accordingly, provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable Security or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties and subject to fiduciary duties of management (a guarantee or Security interest will not be required if giving such guarantee or taking such Security would expose the directors of the relevant Issuer to a material risk of personal liability)) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or Transaction Security Document shall be subject to such limit; (2) certain general meeting, supervisory board, works council or another external body's or person's consent may be required to enable a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or Security. Such guarantee and/or Security shall not be required unless such consent has been received, provided _that reasonable endeavors have been used by the relevant member of the Group to obtain the_ relevant consent (in each case if the Agent, taking into account the Issuer's view on any potential impact on relationships with third parties, reasonably requests the Issuer to do so); (3) a key factor in determining whether or not (and the terms on which) a guarantee or Security shall be taken (and in respect of the Security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the applicable time and cost (including, but not limited to, adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration costs and taxes, notarial costs, translation costs and all applicable legal and registration fees and adverse effects on the ability of the Group to obtain or maintain local facilities or other financing arrangements, including any factoring or similar arrangement in each case permitted under the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement) which shall not be disproportionate to the benefit to the Finance Parties of obtaining such guarantee or Security; (4) the maximum guaranteed or secured amount may be subject to limitations to minimize stamp duty, notarization, registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties where the benefit of the ----- guaranteed or secured amount is disproportionate to the level of such stamp duty, notarization, registration or other applicable fee, taxes and duties (and in any event the maximum aggregate amount payable by the Group in respect of fees, costs, expenses, disbursements and VAT relating to the provision of Note Guarantees and Security shall be limited to an amount to be agreed between the Security Agent and the Issuer);

(6) members of the Group will not be required to give Note Guarantees or enter into Transaction Security Documents if they are not wholly owned by members of the Group and such subsidiaries will not be required to provide Note Guarantees or Security, in either case, if the relevant minority shareholders have not provided their prior consent to such Security or Note Guarantees being granted where such consent is required provided that reasonable endeavors to obtain such consent shall be used by the Group if (i) the relevant entity is not subject to any statutory requirement as to the composition of its shareholders, and (ii) the relevant asset is material and the Issuer determines that such endeavors will not have a negative impact on commercial relationships with third parties; (7) members of the Group will not be required to give Note Guarantees or enter into Transaction Security Documents if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of any director of or any member of the Group _provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable Transaction Security Document or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or Transaction Security Document shall be subject to such limit; (8) Note Guarantees and Security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of Security will not exceed an amount to be agreed between the Issuer and the Security Agent; (9) where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting Security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such Security, Security will be granted over the material assets only; (10) any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, license, instrument, regulatory constraint (including any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third party arrangement (other than restrictions contained in the constitutional documents of a member of the Group or in any intra-Group loan agreement), which may prevent or condition the asset from being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable Transaction Security Document (including requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable Transaction Security Document, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to any member of the Group in respect of the asset or require the relevant chargor to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof, in each case will be excluded from a guarantee or Transaction Security Document; (11) the giving of a guarantee, the granting of Security and the registration and/or the perfection of the Security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant Obligor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Finance Documents (including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits of obligations, in each case prior to a Declared Default or a Declared RCF Default which is continuing), and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to this paragraph (11); ----- (12) no guarantee or Security will be required to be given by or over any Acquired Person or Asset (and no consent shall be required to be sought with respect thereto) which are required to support Acquired Indebtedness to the extent such Acquired Indebtedness is permitted by the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement to remain outstanding after an acquisition. No member of a target group or other entity acquired pursuant to an acquisition permitted by the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement shall be required to become a Guarantor or grant Security with respect to the Facilities if prevented by the terms of the documentation governing that acquired indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or if becoming a Guarantor or the granting of any Security would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation) under or in relation thereto; no Security will be granted over any asset secured for the benefit of any Permitted Indebtedness and/or to the extent constituting a Permitted Lien unless specifically required by a Finance Document to the contrary; (13) to the extent possible and legally effective, all Security shall be given in favor of the Security Agent and not the Finance Parties individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of Transaction Security Documents for all the Finance Parties); ""Parallel Debt"" provisions will be used where necessary and such provisions will be contained in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual Transaction Security Documents, unless agreed by the Issuer and the Security Agent as being required to avoid an amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement; no member of the Group will be required to take any action in relation to any guarantees or Security as a result of any assignment or transfer by a Lender; (14) to the extent possible and unless required by applicable law, there should be no action required to be taken in relation to the Note Guarantees or Security when any Lender assigns or transfers any of its participation to a new Lender (and, unless explicitly agreed to the contrary in the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement, no member of the Group shall bear or otherwise be liable for any taxes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, stamp duty (Rechtsgeschäftsgebühr) under Austrian law), any notarial, registration or perfection fees or any other costs, fees or expenses that result from any assignment or transfer by a Finance Party); (15) Security will, where possible and practicable, automatically create Security over future assets of the same type as those already secured; where local law requires supplemental pledges, additional information, such as lists of assets, or notices to be delivered in respect of future acquired assets in order for effective Security to be created over that class of asset, such supplemental pledges, lists of assets or notices will be provided only upon request of the Security Agent if a Declared Default or a Declared RCF Default has occurred and is continuing and at intervals no more frequent than annually; (16) no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be required; (17) unless granted under a global Transaction Security Document governed by the law of the jurisdiction of a Guarantor or under English law, all Security (other than share Security over an Obligor Subsidiary) shall be governed by the law of, and shall secure only assets located in the jurisdiction of incorporation of that Guarantor; (18) the Note Guarantees and Security will not be required from or over, or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group (other than the Issuer) that is not wholly-owned by another member of the Group; (19) each Transaction Security Document shall be deemed not to restrict or condition any transaction permitted under the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security granted under each Transaction Security Document shall be deemed to be subject to these Agreed Security Principles, before and after the execution of the relevant Transaction Security Document and creation of the relevant Security; (20) no Security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement; (21) except as provided in (15) above, no Security will be taken over receivables if it would require periodic listing, filing, notification or specification of such receivables; ----- (22) no Security will be required over any assets subject to Security in favor of a third party (other than in relation to Security under general business conditions of account banks which do not prohibit or prevent the creation of Security over such accounts) or any cash constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets shall be excluded from any relevant Transaction Security Document); (23) no translation of any document relating to any Security or any asset subject to any Security will be required to be prepared or provided to the Finance Parties, unless (i) required for such documents to become effective and admissible in evidence and (ii) a Declared Default or a Declared RCF Default has occurred and is continuing; and (24) no Security will be required to be granted over any class of assets other than (i) shares in any Material Subsidiary, (ii) material bank accounts of the Issuer (without control or notification prior to the occurrence of a Declared Default or a Declared RCF Default which is continuing) and (iii) receivables owing to Obligors (being loans downstreaming the proceeds of the Facilities or the equity contribution into the Group on or around the Completion Date);

Share security over any subsidiary will be governed by the law of the place of incorporation of that subsidiary. Any security over a structural intercompany loan will be, at the option of the Issuer, governed by the governing law of such structural intra-Group loan document or English law. _Terms of Transaction Security Documents_ The following principles will be reflected in the terms of any Transaction Security: (1) Security will not be enforceable or crystallize unless and until a Declared Default or Declared RCF Default has occurred and is continuing;

and (b) nothing in any Transaction Security Document shall (or be construed to) prohibit any transaction, matter or other step (or a grantor of security taking or entering into the same) or dealing in any manner whatsoever in relation to any asset (including all rights, claims, benefits, proceeds and documentation, and contractual counterparties in relation thereto) the subject of (or expressed to be the subject of) the Transaction Security Document if permitted by the terms of the other Finance Documents (and accordingly to such extent, the Security Agent shall promptly effect releases, confirmations, consents to deal or similar steps always at the cost of the relevant grantor of the Security); (c) in no event shall control agreements (or perfection by control or similar arrangements) be required with respect to any assets (including deposit or securities accounts); (d) each Transaction Security Document must contain a clause which records that if there is a conflict between the Transaction Security Document and the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement then (to the fullest extent permitted by law) the provisions of the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement or (as applicable) the Intercreditor Agreement will take priority over the provisions of the Transaction Security Document (and that, if requested to do so by (and at the cost of) the Issuer, the Security Agent will enter into such amendments, waivers or consents as are necessary to remove such conflict); (e) in respect of the share pledges, unless a Declared Default or a Declared RCF Default has occurred and is continuing (and, in relation to share pledges governed by German law, at all times), the pledgors shall be permitted to retain and to exercise voting rights to any shares pledged by them in a manner which (other than pursuant to a step or matter which does not otherwise breach the terms of the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement) does not adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the Security or cause an Event of Default to occur, and the pledgors shall be permitted to receive and retain dividends on pledged shares and pay dividends up-stream on pledged shares to the extent permitted under the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement; (f) the Finance Parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant time) will only be able to exercise any power of attorney granted to them under the Transaction Security Documents if a Declared Default or a Declared RCF Default has occurred and is continuing or after failure by the grantor of such Security to comply with a further assurance or perfection obligation (and any grace period applicable thereto has expired), but, in the case of a failure to comply with a further assurance or perfection obligation, only to the extent necessary to comply with such further assurance or perfection obligation; (g) any rights of set-off will not be exercisable unless a Declared Default or a Declared RCF Default has occurred and is continuing; and (h) the Transaction Security Documents must (but in connection with German notarial security, only to the extent legally possible) contain a clause substantially similar to the following: _Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but without prejudice to the creation or perfection of any security interest under this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed so as to prohibit or restrict any transaction,_ ----- _matter or other step (or the [security grantor] taking or entering into the same or dealing in any manner whatsoever in relation to any asset (including all rights, claims, benefits, proceeds and documentation, and contractual counterparties in relation thereto)) permitted by the Debt Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (other than this Agreement), and the Security Agent shall promptly enter into such documentation and/or take such other action in relation to this Agreement as is required by the [security grantor] (acting reasonably) in order to facilitate any such transaction, matter or other step, including, but not limited to, by way of executing any confirmation, consent to dealing, release or other similar or equivalent document, or returning any physical collateral. Guarantees/Security_ Subject to applicable practical and/or legal limitations, each Note Guarantee will be an up-stream, crossstream and downstream guarantee and Security for all liabilities of the Obligors under the Finance Documents in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of the Agreed Security Principles in each relevant jurisdiction. Transaction Security Documents will secure the guarantee obligations of the relevant Security provider or, if such Security is provided on a third party basis, all liabilities of the Obligors under the Finance Documents, in each case in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of the Agreed Security Principles in each relevant jurisdiction. The Security Agent or the Finance Parties, as the case may be, shall at the cost and request of the Obligors promptly discharge any guarantees and release any Security which is or are or has become subject to any legal or regulatory prohibition as is referred to in the preceding paragraph. To the extent that any member of the Group is required under these Agreed Security Principles to use reasonable endeavors to obtain consent from any third party, if the member of the Group has used its reasonable endeavors but has not been able to obtain such consent within 15 Business Days, such requirement to use reasonable endeavors shall cease on the expiry of such 15 Business Day period. Any Transaction Security Document shall only be required to be notarized or notarially certified if required by law in order for the relevant Security to become effective or admissible in evidence or unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Issuer. _Bank Accounts_ If an Obligor grants security over its material current bank accounts it will be free to deal, operate and transact business in relation to those accounts (including opening and closing accounts) until the occurrence of a Declared Default or a Declared RCF Default which is continuing. For the avoidance of doubt, there will be no ""fixed"" security over bank accounts, cash or receivables or any obligation to hold or pay cash or receivables in a particular account until the occurrence of a Declared Default or a Declared RCF Default which is continuing. Any security over bank accounts will be subject to any security interests in favor of the account bank which are created either by law or in the standard terms and conditions of the account bank. No member of the Group will be required to change its banking arrangements or standard terms and conditions in connection with the granting of bank account security. _Shares_ Security over shares, stocks or partnership interests granted by an Obligor will be limited to those over a wholly-owned Obligor incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction. For the avoidance of doubt, no Security shall be required to be granted by, or over the shares in, entities which are not wholly-owned Obligors incorporated in a Guarantor Jurisdiction. Until a Declared Default or a Declared RCF Default is continuing, the legal title of the shares will remain with the relevant grantor of the Security (unless transfer of title on granting such Security is customary in the applicable jurisdiction (as agreed between the legal counsel of the Group and the legal counsel of the Agent in the relevant jurisdiction)) and any grantor of share Security will be permitted to retain and to exercise voting rights and powers in relation to any shares and other related rights charged by it and receive, own and retain all assets and proceeds in relation thereto without restriction or condition. With respect to ----- any Issuer incorporated in Germany, the voting rights and powers in relation to the shares in such Issuer will remain with the grantor of the security at all times. Italian pledges over quotas in Italian limited liability companies (società a responsabilità limitata) or any other Transaction Security Document governed by Italian law which require to be entered into in notarial form, in each case securing third parties' obligations (i.e., obligations different from the relevant pledgor's own obligations as borrower) shall be subject to a cap on the secured obligations to be agreed from time to time with respect to the specific circumstances between the pledgor and the Security Agent. Unless the restriction if required by law or the terms of a shareholders agreement, the constitutional documents of the Issuer whose shares are to be pledged will be amended to the extent that it is within the power of the pledgor to do so (without breaching obligations to third parties) to remove any restriction on the pledging of such shares and on the transfer or the registration of the transfer of the shares on enforcement of the Security granted over them. Where customary and applicable as a matter of law, in the case of: (1) any Transaction Security Document entered into pursuant to Part 1 (Conditions Precedent to _Initial Utilisation) of Schedule 2 (Conditions Precedent) in the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement,_ as soon as reasonably practicable following the Issue Date (and taking into account any stamping requirements in respect of any stock transfer form (or applicable law equivalent)); and (2) in any other circumstance, following a request by the Security Agent following a Declared Default or a Declared RCF Default which is continuing, the applicable share certificate (or other documents evidencing title to the relevant shares) and a stock transfer form executed in blank (or applicable law equivalent) will be provided to the Security Agent upon its request. _No other security_ Subject to these Agreed Security Principles, the Obligors will only grant the following security: (1) Security over the shares in any wholly-owned Material Subsidiary; (2) Security over any material structural intra-Group receivables owing to Obligors (being loans down-streaming the proceeds of the Facilities or the equity contribution into the Group on or around the Completion Date); and (3) Security (without control or notification prior to the occurrence of a Declared Default or a Declared RCF Default which is continuing) of the Issuer's material bank accounts.

Notes repurchased by the Issuer pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will have the status of Notes issued but not outstanding or will be retired and cancelled at the option of the Issuer. Notes purchased by a third party pursuant to the preceding paragraph will have the status of Notes issued and outstanding. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than ten nor more than 60 days' prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date. The Issuer will comply in all material respects with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations applicable to us conflict with the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes, the Issuer will comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached our obligations under the Change of Control Offer provisions of the Notes by virtue of any such conflict. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited, by the terms of any indebtedness, from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer may seek the consent of the holders of such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such a consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer would remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer's failure to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, the Indenture will provide that the Issuer's failure to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under clause (iv) and not clause (i) under the caption ""—Events of _Default."" Indebtedness incurred in the future may contain prohibitions on the occurrence of certain events_ that would constitute a Change of Control or require the repurchase of such indebtedness upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of Notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase their Notes could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on us. Finally, the ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Issuer's then existing financial resources. We cannot assure you that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—We may not be able to obtain the funds _required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control.""_ If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will release a notice of any Change of Control through the Exchange (with a copy to the Trustee and Paying Agent) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of the Exchange (www.tisegroup.com). ----- For purposes of the foregoing discussion of a Change of Control Offer, the following definitions are applicable: ""Change of Control"" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the Issuer becomes aware (by way of a report or any other filing pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, proxy, vote, written notice or otherwise) of any ""person"" or ""group"" of related persons (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date), other than one or more Permitted Holders, being or becoming the ""beneficial owner"" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act as in effect on the Issue Date) of more than 50% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Issuer provided that no Change of Control shall be deemed to occur by reason of the Issuer (or any Successor Issuer) becoming a Subsidiary of a Successor Parent and any Voting Stock of which any Permitted Holder is the ""beneficial owner"" (as so defined) shall not be included in any Voting Stock of which any such person or group is the ""beneficial owner"" (as so defined), unless that person or group is not an Affiliate of a Permitted Holder and has greater voting power with respect to that Voting Stock; (2) Ephios Subco 2 (or any successor entity as a result of a merger of Ephios Subco 2 permitted by the Indenture) ceasing to directly own 100% of the total issued share capital of the Issuer (or any successor entity as a result of a merger of the Issuer permitted by the Indenture); or (3) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, amalgamation, consolidation or other business combination transaction), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Group taken as a whole to a person, other than a Restricted Subsidiary or one or more Permitted Holders, provided that_ notwithstanding the foregoing: (1) a transaction will not be deemed to involve a Change of Control solely as a result of the Issuer becoming an indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of a Holding Company if: (a) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of such Holding Company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of the Issuer's Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction; or (b) immediately following that transaction no person (other than a Holding Company satisfying the requirements of (1) above) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of such Holding Company; (2) the right to acquire Voting Stock (so long as such person does not have the right to direct the voting of the Voting Stock subject to such right) or any veto power in connection with the acquisition or disposition of Voting Stock will not be deemed to cause a party to be a beneficial owner; (3) for the avoidance of doubt, a Permitted Specified Asset Disposition shall not constitute a Change of Control; and (4) a Permitted Transaction under paragraph (a), (d) or (h) of the definition thereof shall not constitute a Change of Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change of Control shall not be deemed to have occurred if such Change of Control is also a Specified Change of Control. The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of ""all or substantially all"" of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ""substantially all,"" there is no precise, established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the applicability of the requirement that the Issuer offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another person or group may be uncertain. In addition, if an event constitutes a Change of Control, the definitions of Change of Control and Permitted Holders expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Issuer in a transaction that is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including anything in the financial definitions), when calculating any Applicable Metric, the financial definitions or component thereof but excluding Excess Cash Flow, the Issuer shall be permitted to: (1) exclude all or any part of any expenditure or other negative item (and/or the impact thereof) directly or indirectly relating to or resulting from: (a) the Transactions; (b) any other acquisition, Investment or other joint venture permitted by the terms of the Indenture or the impact from purchase price accounting; (c) start-up costs for new businesses and branding or re-branding of existing businesses; (d) Restructuring Costs; (e) research and development expenditure (and the capitalization thereof); and/or (f) the implementation of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and/or IFRS 16 (Leases) and any successor standard thereto (or any equivalent measure under IFRS or the generally accepted accounting principles in the Issuer's jurisdiction of incorporation); and/or (2) include any addbacks (without further verification or diligence) for adjustments (including anticipated synergies) or costs or expenses (i) reflected in the base case financial model prepared in connection with the Transactions and delivered to the lenders and agent under the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement, due diligence reports prepared in connection with the Transactions and delivered to the lenders and agent under the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement and/or any quality of earnings report provided to the mandated lead arrangers under the 2023 Senior Facilities Agreement prior to the date of the Indenture (as amended, varied, supplemented and/or updated on ----- or prior to the Completion Date, to the extent such amendment, variation, supplement and/or update is not materially prejudicial to the Holders) and/or (ii) taken into account in determining Opening Consolidated EBITDA. To the extent any Applicable Metric is used as the basis (in whole or in part) for permitting any transaction or making any determination under the Indenture (including on a pro forma basis), no item shall be included or excluded more than once where to do so would result in double counting. Any Applicable Metric to be determined in connection with an Applicable Transaction may, at the Issuer's option, be determined as at the Applicable Test Date. If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with paragraph directly above, such Applicable Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes; provided that: (1) the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate any Applicable Metric on the basis of a more recent Applicable Test Date, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the relevant Applicable Test Date for purposes of such Applicable Metrics; and (2) save as contemplated in clause (1) above, compliance with any Applicable Metric shall not be determined or tested at any time after the relevant Applicable Test Date for such transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto. If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an Applicable Test Date would at any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (or any other Applicable Metric), such Applicable Metric will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations. If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the Applicable Test Date would at any time after the Applicable Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of a Default or an Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing). Subject to clause (8) of the third paragraph of ""—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and _Issuance of Preferred Stock,"" in calculating the availability under any Applicable Metric in connection with_ any action or transaction unrelated to the Applicable Transaction following the relevant Applicable Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Applicable Transaction is consummated or the Issuer determines (in its sole discretion) that such Applicable Transaction will not be consummated, any such Applicable Metric shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Applicable Transaction. Any Incurrence or drawing of any revolving Indebtedness to finance the working capital needs of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (including under the New Revolving Credit Facility) and, for the avoidance of doubt, subject to clause (8) of the third paragraph of ""—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of _Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock,"" any undrawn commitments for Indebtedness (including_ under the New Revolving Credit Facility) shall be disregarded for the purposes of testing the Applicable Metric.

For purposes of determining compliance with: (1) any euro denominated Applicable Metric (other than in respect of any calculation of any financial covenant or ratio under the Finance Documents or related usage, ratchet or permission), the euro equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated using a rate of exchange selected by the Issuer (acting reasonably and in good faith) on the Applicable Test Date (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the rate of any foreign exchange hedging entered into by the Group in relation to the Applicable Transaction); or (2) any other Applicable Metric (including in respect of any calculation of any financial covenant or ratio under the Finance Documents), the euro equivalent of amounts denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated, at the Issuer's option, using any of: (a) any applicable weighted average spot conversion rates over the relevant testing period; (b) any applicable conversion rates used in any relevant financial statements or management accounts; (c) any applicable conversion rate selected by the Issuer (acting reasonably and in good faith) on the relevant date of determination (including the Applicable Test Date, if applicable); or (d) any applicable conversion rate under any foreign exchange hedging arrangement entered into by any member of the Group; and, in each case, no Default, Event of Default or any breach of representation or warranty or undertaking shall arise merely as a result of a subsequent change in the euro equivalent amount of any relevant amount due to fluctuations in exchange rates. ----- For any relevant Applicable Metric set by reference to a Financial Year, a calendar year, a Relevant Testing Period, a four-quarter period, a twelve-month period or any other similar annual period (each an ""Annual",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. However, a Default under clause (iii) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuer (and the Trustee if given by Holders) of the Default and the Issuer does not cure such Default within the time specified in such clause after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default (other than a Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuer, or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon the effectiveness of such a declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Under certain circumstances, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice thereof, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee and, if requested, the Trustee has received, customary indemnification and/or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless (i) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing, (ii) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy, (iii) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense, (iv) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability ----- or expense and (v) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not any such directions are unduly prejudicial to such Holders) or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses (including legal fees) caused by taking or not taking such action. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly. The Indenture will provide that if the Trustee has received written notice (in accordance with the terms of the Indenture) that a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee must send to each Holder notice of the Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it receives such written notice. Except in the case of an Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or premium (if any) or interest on or Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to, any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as it in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. In addition, the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer's Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default occurring during the previous year. The Issuer also is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any event that would constitute certain Defaults or Events of Default, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.

504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.57,Certain Luxembourg Tax Considerations,21.57.1,Withholding Tax,"_Non-resident holders of Notes_ Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force, all payments of interest (including accrued but unpaid interest) and principal by the Issuer to non-resident holders of Notes in the context of the holding, disposal, redemption or repurchase of the Notes, which are not profit sharing, can be made free and clear of any withholding tax. _Resident holders of Notes_ In accordance with Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force and subject however to the application of the Luxembourg law of December 23, 2005, as amended (the ""Relibi **Law""), there is no withholding tax on payments of principal, premium or interest made to Luxembourg resident holders of Notes, nor on accrued but unpaid interest in respect of Notes, nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax payable upon redemption or repurchase of Notes held by Luxembourg resident holders of Notes. The Relibi Law has introduced a 20% withholding tax on interest payments or similar income made or ascribed by a paying agent established in Luxembourg to or for an individual beneficial owner who is a resident of Luxembourg. Pursuant to the law of December 23, 2005 as amended, Luxembourg resident individuals can opt to selfdeclare and pay a 20% levy on interest payments made or ascribed by paying agents located outside Luxembourg in a Member State of either the European Union or the European Economic Area. The 20% withholding tax as described above or the 20% levy are in full discharge of income tax when Luxembourg resident individuals are acting in the context of the management of their private wealth. Responsibility for the withholding of tax in application of the Relibi Law, is assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent within the meaning of the Relibi Law and not by the Issuer. ----- _Transposition of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive in Luxembourg law_ On December 18, 2018 and on December 20, 2019, Luxembourg transposed respectively the EU Council Directive 2016/1164 laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market into Luxembourg domestic law, and the EU Council Directive 2017/952 amending EU Council Directive 2016/1164 as regards hybrid mismatches with third countries into Luxembourg domestic law (the ""ATAD""). The ATAD introduced new tax measures into Luxembourg law, including among others a limitation as regards so-called ""exceeding borrowing costs"" and hybrid mismatch rules. Whilst certain exemptions and safe harbor provisions (for example, exceeding borrowing costs up to €3 million will remain deductible – subject to the implementation of the DEBRA Proposal as outlined below) exist in relation to the limitation of exceeding borrowing costs, these new rules may in certain situations result in the limitation respectively the denial of the deduction of payments to investors for Luxembourg tax purposes, which may adversely affect the income tax position of the Issuer and as such affect generally its ability to make payments to the Holders. The exact impact of the ATAD on the Issuer would need to be monitored on a regular basis, notably in the light of any future guidance from the Luxembourg tax authorities. Prospective Holders should make an investment decision only after careful consideration, with its independent advisers, as to the consequences of the ATAD. _The Unshell Proposal_ The EU Commission published a proposal for a Council Directive laying down rules to prevent the misuse of shell entities for tax purposes and amending Directive 2011/16/EU on December 22, 2021 (the so-called ""Unshell Proposal,"" also known as ""ATAD 3""). These new rules would mainly apply to EU entities (i) deriving passive income, (ii) engaged in cross-border transactions and (iii) which outsourced the administration of day-to-day operations and the decision-making on significant functions. EU entities that meet these three conditions would need to declare in their annual tax returns whether they meet indicators of minimum substance and provide related documentary evidence (unless they benefit from an automatic exemption). Entities not meeting those indicators of minimum substance and that cannot rely on an automatic exemption will be presumed not to have sufficient substance for tax purposes (unless they can rebut this presumption by providing evidence (i) of the business activities which they perform to generate their passive income or (ii) that they do not serve the objective of obtaining a tax advantage). In this case and in the absence of rebuttal of the presumption, such EU entities would not be allowed to benefit from the provisions of double tax treaties or certain EU Directives. In addition, they would not be entitled to a certificate of tax residence to the extent that such certificate serves to obtain the benefit of the aforementioned provisions. On January 17, 2023, the European Parliament approved the European Commission's draft of the Unshell Proposal, as amended by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on December 9, 2022. Based on discussions with various officials of Member States, an agreement as regards the Unshell Proposal seems far from being achieved (noting that some countries seem to strongly oppose the Unshell Proposal in its current condition). Therefore, the final text will be further discussed and potentially amended by the Council of the European Union. _The DEBRA Proposal_ On May 11, 2022, the EU Commission published a directive proposal laying down (i) a debt-equity bias reduction allowance and (ii) a new limitation to the tax deductibility of exceeding borrowing costs (the socalled ""DEBRA""). The purpose of the DEBRA proposal is to address the asymmetry in tax treatment between debt and equity financing by neutralizing the bias against equity financing. The interest deduction limitation rule provided by the DEBRA proposal will interact with the interest barrier rule provided by ATAD (see above). While the interest barrier rule under the ATAD currently provides that exceeding borrowing costs shall be deductible up to 30% of the taxable EBITDA (with a de minimis threshold of €3 million), the DEBRA proposal limits the deductibility of interest to 85% of exceeding borrowing costs. Should the DEBRA proposal be adopted, Member States would have to implement the directive into their national law by December 31, 2023 and the provisions would come into effect as of January 1, 2024.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.58,Certain German Tax Considerations,21.58.1,German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer),"With regard to savings earnings (Kapitalerträge) (e.g., interest or capital gains) German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer) will be levied if the Notes are held in a custodial account which the investor maintains with a German securities institution or a German branch of a German or non-German credit or financial services institution (a ""German Disbursing Agent"") and such German Disbursing Agent credits or pays out the earnings. If the Notes are not kept or administered in a custodial account, German withholding tax will nevertheless be levied if the Notes are issued as definitive securities and the savings earnings are paid by a German Disbursing Agent against presentation of the Notes or interest coupons (so-called over-thecounter transaction – Tafelgeschäft). The tax base is, in principle, equal to the taxable gross income as set out above (i.e., prior to withholding). However, in the case of capital gains, if the custodial account has changed since the time of acquisition of the Notes (e.g., if the Notes had been transferred from a non-EU custodial account prior to the sale) and the acquisition costs of the Notes are not proven to the German Disbursing Agent in the form required by law (e.g., in the case of over-the-counter transactions), withholding tax is applied to 30% of the proceeds from the redemption or sale of the Notes. When computing the tax base for withholding tax purposes, the German Disbursing Agent has to deduct any negative savings income (negative Kapitalerträge) or paid accrued interest (Stückzinsen) in the same calendar year or unused negative savings income of previous calendar years. Losses arising from a full or partial non-recoverability of the repayment claim under the Notes including a default of the Issuer, bad debt (Forderungsausfall) or a transfer of an impaired receivable to a third party or from any other default can only be offset against other income from capital investments and only up to an amount of €20,000 per year. Respective losses exceeding the amount of €20,000 can be carried forward and might be set off in future tax periods (together with current capital investment losses of each such tax period) up to an amount of €20,000 per year (the ""Limitation on Loss Deduction""). Given the Limitation on Loss Deduction will not be applied by the German Disbursing Agent holding the Notes in custody, investors suffering losses which are subject to the Limitation on Loss Deduction are required to declare such losses in their income tax return. Although the relevant amount has been increased from €10,000 to €20,000, the constitutionality of the Limitation on Loss Deduction is still being debated. Therefore, investors affected by the Limitation on Loss Deduction are advised to seek individual tax advice. German withholding tax will be levied by a German Disbursing Agent at a flat withholding tax rate of 26.375% (including solidarity surcharge) plus, if applicable, church tax. Church tax, if applicable, will be collected by the German Disbursing Agent by way of withholding unless the investor has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern). In the latter case, the investor has to include the savings income in the tax return and will then be assessed to church tax. Further, church tax is not collected by way of withholding if the investment income forms part of income from trade business, self-employment, agriculture and forestry, or letting and leasing. No German withholding tax will be levied if the investor has filed a withholding tax exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the German Disbursing Agent, but only to the extent the savings income does not exceed the exemption amount shown on the withholding tax exemption certificate. Currently, the maximum exemption amount is €1,000 (€2,000 in the case of jointly assessed spouses or registered life partners). Similarly, no withholding tax will be levied if the investor has submitted a certificate of nonassessment (Nichtveranlagungs-Bescheinigung) issued by the relevant local tax office to the German Disbursing Agent. ----- The Issuer is not obliged to levy German withholding tax in respect of payments on the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.58,Certain German Tax Considerations,21.58.2,Tax assessment,"The taxation of savings income shall take place mainly by way of levying withholding tax (please see above). If and to the extent German withholding tax has been levied, such withholding tax shall, in principle, become definitive and replace the investor's income taxation. If no withholding tax has been levied other than by virtue of a withholding tax exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) and in certain other cases, the investor is nevertheless obliged to file a tax return, and the savings income will then be taxed within the assessment procedure (Veranlagungsverfahren). If the investor is subject to church tax and has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für _Steuern), the investor is also obliged to include the savings income in the tax return for church tax purposes._ However, also in the assessment procedure, savings income is principally taxed at a separate tax rate for savings income (gesonderter Steuertarif für Einkünfte aus Kapitalvermögen) being identical to the withholding tax rate (26.375% - including solidarity surcharge (Solidaritätszuschlag) plus, if applicable, church tax). In certain cases, the investor may apply to be assessed on the basis of its personal tax rate if such rate is lower than the above tax rate. Such application can only be filed consistently for all savings income within the assessment period. In case of jointly assessed spouses or registered life partners the application can only be filed for savings income of both spouses/life partners. When computing the savings income, the saver's lump sum amount (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €1,000 (€2,000 in the case of jointly assessed spouses or registered life partners) will be deducted. The deduction of the actual income related expenses, if any, is excluded. That holds true even if the investor applies to be assessed on the basis of its personal tax rate. Where Notes form part of a trade or business, the withholding tax, if any, will not satisfy the personal or corporate income tax liability. The respective holder must include income and related (business) expenses in the annual tax return and the balance will be taxed at the holder's applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability, be refunded. Where Notes form part of a German trade or business the current income and gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes may also be subject to German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz). If the holder is an individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely or partly credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate. The Commission's proposal has a very broad scope and could, if introduced in its current form, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. Under the Commission's proposal, FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, ""established"" in a Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (i) by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State or (ii) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a Participating Member State. However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between Participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate and/or certain of the Participating Member States may decide to withdraw. ----- At the ECOFIN Council meeting of June 14, 2019, a state of play of the work on the FTT was presented on the basis of a note prepared by Germany on June 7, 2019 indicating a consensus among the Participating Member States (excluding Estonia) to continue negotiations on the basis of a joint French-German proposal based on the French financial transactions tax model which in principle would only concern shares of listed companies whose head office is in a Member State of the European Union.

504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.60,Certain French Taxation Considerations,21.60.1,Taxation of payments under the Guarantee made by a Guarantor established in France,"There is no case law or official guidance from the French tax authorities in respect of payments made under a guarantee. There is therefore some uncertainty as to the precise tax qualification applicable in France to such payments. In accordance with one interpretation of French tax law, payments made under a Guarantee by a Guarantor established in France are to be treated as payments in lieu of payments to be made on the Notes by the Issuer. Accordingly, under this interpretation, payments to be made by a Guarantor established in France under a Guarantee should not be subject to withholding taxes in France to the extent that payments made or to be made by the Issuer would not be subject to withholding taxes in France by reason of it not being resident of, or otherwise established in France. In accordance with another interpretation of French tax law, payments made under a Guarantee by a Guarantor established in France are to be treated as payments independent from the payments to be made under the Notes by the Issuer. Accordingly, and in the absence of any specific provision to the contrary in the French Code général des impôts, such payments should be out of the scope from withholding taxes in France. Alternatively, payments made under a Guarantee by a Guarantor established in France could be treated as French-source payments of interest for French tax purposes. Under this interpretation, payments to be made by a Guarantor established in France under a Guarantee should not be subject to withholding taxes in France to the extent that payments are not made in a non-cooperative jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the French _Code général des impôts (a ""Non-Cooperative Jurisdiction"") other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of such Article 238-0 A nor to a person domiciled or established in such a NonCooperative Jurisdiction Other interpretations, which may lead to a different treatment under French tax law, cannot be ruled out. In the unlikely circumstances where payments made by a Guarantor established in France under the Guarantee are regarded as payments made by a person who carries on a business in France to a person who has no permanent professional installation (installation professionnelle permanente) in France in consideration for services (whatever their nature) supplied or used in France, such payments could be subject to withholding tax in France pursuant to Article 182 B of the French Code général des impôts, subject to the more favorable provisions of an applicable double treaty.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

By exception, pursuant to Article 125 A I of the French Code général des impôts, and subject to certain exceptions, where the paying agent is established in France, interest and assimilated revenue received by French tax resident individuals are subject to a 12.8% mandatory (non-final) withholding tax. If applicable, this withholding tax is creditable against the applicable personal income tax liability in respect of the year in which the payment has been made. If the withholding tax paid exceeds the total amount of personal income tax due, the excess will be refunded.

A U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be required to include, in ordinary income, the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars. A cash basis U.S. Holder will not realize exchange gain or loss on the receipt of the interest income, but it may recognize exchange gain or loss upon the actual disposition of the euro received. A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the amount of interest income in the euro that has accrued during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such accrued income will be determined by translating such income at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate for the partial period within the U.S. Holder's taxable year. A U.S. Holder may elect, however, to translate such accrued interest income using the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that ----- spans two taxable years, using the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the portion of the accrual period within the U.S. Holder's taxable year. If the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. Holder may translate such interest at the spot rate on the date of receipt. The above election will apply to other obligations held by the U.S. Holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income on the date such interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro received (translated at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of interest income that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars.

A U.S. Holder's adjusted basis in a Note will be determined by reference to the U.S. dollar cost of the Note and increased for any accruals of OID.

Under ERISA, a person who exercises discretionary authority or control regarding the management or disposition of an ERISA Plan's assets is generally considered a fiduciary of such an ERISA Plan. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA's general fiduciary requirements, which should be considered with regards to each ERISA Plan's particular facts and circumstances. For example, when considering an investment in the Notes with an ERISA Plan's assets, the ERISA Plan's fiduciary would typically determine, particularly in light of the risks and limited liquidity inherent in an investment in the Notes, whether the investment in the Notes would (i) satisfy the diversification requirements of Section 404(a)(1)(C) of ERISA, (ii) be in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the ERISA Plan pursuant to Section 404(a)(1)(D) of ERISA and (iii) be prudent with respect to the structure and nature of the Offering. In addition, ERISA requires an ERISA Plan's fiduciary to maintain indicia of ownership for the ERISA Plan's assets within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal District Courts. While it is not intended that the Issuer's underlying assets will be ""plan assets,"" there can be no assurance that, notwithstanding the Issuer's commercially reasonable efforts, the Issuer's underlying assets will not otherwise be deemed to include ""plan assets"" for the purposes of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. In any event, the Issuer is not accepting any appointment, conditional or otherwise, as a fiduciary to an investing ERISA Plan. Fiduciaries of ERISA Plans should also consider ERISA's rules relating to delegation of control. ERISA Plans investing in the Notes may be required to report compensation, including indirect compensation, paid in connection with the ERISA Plan's investment on Schedule C of Form 5500 (Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan). The descriptions in this Offering Memorandum of services provided to stockholders, management fees, incentive fees, ancillary fees, direct fees, other fees and direct compensation paid by stockholders and any indirect compensation and commissions earned by the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers in respect of an investment in the Notes, including the fees paid to the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and the payor, are intended to satisfy the disclosure requirement for ""eligible indirect compensation,"" for which an alternative reporting procedure on Schedule C of Form 5500 may be available.

The Recast EU Insolvency Regulation is applicable to insolvency proceedings opened after June 26, 2017. Insolvency proceedings opened before June 26, 2017 are subject to Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (the ""Insolvency Regulation 2000""). The Recast EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings opened in respect of a company whose ""centre of main interests"" is located in a Member State (other than Denmark). _Main Insolvency Proceedings_ Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) within which the center of a debtor's main interests is situated. The ""centre of main interests"" is defined as ""the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties."" Article 3(1), paragraph 2, provides for a rebuttable presumption, whereby in the case of a company it is assumed that its ""centre of main interests"" is in the jurisdiction of the place of its registered office. In order to prevent fraudulent or abusive forum shopping, such presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request of the opening of insolvency proceedings. Otherwise, the presumption shall not apply and the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company will be the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) within which the company had its registered office before moving it. If the ""centre of main interests"" of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation. Pursuant to Preamble 10, Annex A has been extended to include insolvency proceedings previously not falling within the scope of the Insolvency Regulation 2000 in order to promote the rescue of economically viable but financially distressed businesses. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. _Secondary Insolvency Proceedings_ Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in other Member States. If the ""centre of main interests"" of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open ""secondary"" or ""territorial"" insolvency proceedings only in the event that such debtor has an ""establishment"" in the territory of such other Member State. ""Establishment"" is defined as any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. ----- However, under Article 36 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may prevent the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened. For this purpose, the insolvency practitioner must undertake to comply with the distribution and priority rights under the relevant national law and from which the local creditors would benefit if the insolvency proceeding was opened in the Member State were the assets are located. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a majority of local creditors, determined in accordance with applicable local laws. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvent estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it should refuse to open such proceeding if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Pursuant to Article 4 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings will be required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3; such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction. _Insolvency Proceedings Involving Members of a Group of Companies_ The Recast EU Insolvency Regulation provides for a cooperation and communication mechanism in the event that insolvency proceedings concerning two or more members of a group of companies are opened. Insolvency practitioners appointed in proceedings concerning a member of the Group shall cooperate with any insolvency practitioner appointed in proceedings concerning another member of the Group to the extent that such cooperation is appropriate. Similarly, the court which has opened proceedings shall also cooperate with any other court before which a request is made to open proceedings concerning another member of the Group to the extent that cooperation is appropriate to facilitate the effective administration of the proceedings, is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them and does not entail any conflict of interest. In this respect, the courts may, where appropriate, appoint a third party, _provided that_ this is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them. _Applicability_ In the event that the Issuer or any its subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

The law relating to insolvency is regulated by the Austrian Insolvency Act (Insolvenzordnung, IO). The Austrian Insolvency Act regulates (i) bankruptcy proceedings (Konkursverfahren), in which the debtor's assets or business as a whole are sold and the proceeds are distributed among its creditors, after the deduction of the costs of the proceedings and the insolvency administrator, and (ii) recovery proceedings (Sanierungsverfahren), which enable the debtor to discharge its liabilities through quota payments and to continue its activities under certain conditions. Creditors' rights might also be affected by the Austrian Business Reorganization Act (Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz) and the Austrian Restructuring Code (Restrukturierungsordnung), which do not govern insolvency proceedings but regulate the reorganization or restructuring of companies in financial distress. See ""Business Reorganization Proceedings"" and ""Restructuring Proceedings."" With respect to the Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Austria (the ""Austrian Guarantor""), a rebuttable presumption exists that it also has its ""centre of main interests,"" as defined in the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, in Austria. In the event of an insolvency of a company having its ""centre of main interests"" in Austria, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Austria. Such proceedings will be governed by Austrian law (for example, if the ""centre of main interests"" of such company is in Austria or if such company has an ""establishment"" in the territory of the Republic of Austria or, where the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, also if such company has assets in Austria). Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Austria in accordance with Austrian law with respect to the assets of companies that are not organized under Austrian law. Insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzverfahren) are opened by a court if the debtor is insolvent, provided that the insolvency estate's value is sufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. A debtor ----- is insolvent in the case of (i) illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) (i.e., the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due) or (ii) over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) (i.e., the debtor's liabilities exceed the liquidation value of its assets in combination with a negative prognosis on its ability to continue as a going concern (negative Fortbestehensprognose)), each within the meaning of the Austrian Insolvency Act. Under Austrian law, insolvency proceedings may be initiated either by the debtor or a creditor by filing an application to that effect with a court of competent jurisdiction. If insolvency proceedings are initiated upon a creditor's request, such creditor will have to show that the debtor is illiquid or over-indebted. A court may also open recovery proceedings (Sanierungsverfahren), if the risk of the debtor's inability to pay its debts is at least imminent (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and the debtor files an application for the opening of such proceedings. The debtor is obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay upon insolvency. If it is evident that an insolvency cannot be avoided, the debtor is obliged to file for insolvency immediately. If the debtor undertakes promising and realistic measures to stabilize or reverse insolvency, the debtor has a maximum period of 60 days to file. If the debtor's illiquidity is caused by a natural disaster, which includes floods, avalanches, snow pressures, landslides, hurricanes, earthquakes, or, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, pandemics, epidemics, or similar disasters of comparable magnitude, the Austrian Insolvency Act allows the debtor 120 days to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Depending on whether the debtor submits an acceptable recovery plan (Sanierungsplan) together with the application for the opening of insolvency proceedings, the initiated insolvency proceedings may be in the form of recovery proceedings (Sanierungsverfahren) or bankruptcy proceedings (Konkursverfahren), both of which are governed by the provisions of the Austrian Insolvency Act (not the Austrian Restructuring Code). If the debtor has applied for the opening of insolvency proceedings in the form of recovery proceedings and has submitted to the court an acceptable recovery plan (Sanierungsplan) that offers a recovery rate of at least 20% to the unsecured creditors payable within a maximum period of two years, the court initiates insolvency proceedings in the form of recovery proceedings. If the conditions for recovery proceedings are not met, the insolvency court initiates bankruptcy proceedings. The legal provisions regulating recovery proceedings do not apply to bankruptcy proceedings. A debtor may also submit a recovery plan in the course of bankruptcy proceedings that are already in progress; however, if the recovery plan is presented after the opening of the proceedings, the relevant proceedings will continue to be designated as bankruptcy proceedings. In order for the debtor's recovery plan to be approved by the court, it must meet certain criteria specified by insolvency law. A recovery plan generally intends to discharge the debtor from a portion of its debts (up to 80%) and to enable the debtor to continue its business activities. The recovery plan requires the approval of a ""qualified majority"" of the debtor's unsecured creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) to become effective (i.e., the majority of all unsecured creditors present and entitled to vote at the hearing (by headcount) (Kopfmehrheit), provided that the total sum of these creditors' claims amounts to more than 50% of the aggregate amount of all claims of the unsecured creditors present and entitled to vote at the hearing (Kapitalmehrheit)). Once the debtor has complied with the terms of a recovery plan that was duly approved by the creditors and confirmed by the court, it will be released from its remaining outstanding unsecured debts. Unsecured creditors whose claims under the recovery plan have not been satisfied in accordance with the plan's terms may enforce their individual claims against the debtor. In case the recovery plan is not approved by the creditors, the insolvency proceedings will be continued as bankruptcy proceedings. If the recovery proceedings have been initiated and the debtor has submitted qualified documents together with a recovery plan that offers a recovery rate of at least 30% to the unsecured creditors payable over a maximum of two years after the approval of such recovery plan, the debtor qualifies for self-administration (Sanierungsverfahren mit Eigenverwaltung unter Aufsicht eines Verwalters). The self-administration may be withdrawn, if, for example, negative effects on the creditors' positions can be expected. Unless the debtor qualifies for self-administration, the debtor may no longer dispose of the assets belonging to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) as of the opening of the insolvency proceedings. The opening of insolvency proceedings takes effect on the day following the publication of the court's order opening such proceedings in the official online database of Austrian insolvencies (www.edikte.justiz.gv.at). After the opening of insolvency proceedings (and unless the debtor qualifies for self-administration), transactions of ----- the debtor with respect to assets belonging to the insolvency estate have no effect against the creditors of the insolvency estate. With its decision to open the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter), and may, depending on the nature and the size of the debtor's business (either _ex _officio or upon the request of the creditors' meeting (Gläubigerversammlung)), appoint a creditors'_ committee (Gläubigerausschuss) charged with monitoring and assisting the insolvency administrator in the discharge of its duties. After the opening of insolvency proceedings (and unless the debtor qualifies for self-administration) only the insolvency administrator is entitled to act on behalf of the insolvency estate. Under Austrian law, an insolvency administrator's role is to continue the debtor's business with a view to enabling a potential reorganization of the debtor's business either by implementing the debtor's recovery plan or by a (partial) sale of the debtor's business. If neither a recovery plan nor a (partial) sale of the debtor's business is possible, the insolvency administrator will discontinue the debtor's business operations. As a result of the ensuing bankruptcy proceedings, the debtor's assets will be liquidated and the proceeds realized thereby will be distributed to the debtor's creditors, with the debtor remaining liable for any portion of its debts not satisfied by such proceeds (to the extent the debtor is not granted a haircut by the Austrian Insolvency Act). If the debtor qualifies for self-administration, the court will proceed with the appointment of a recovery administrator (Sanierungsverwalter) to monitor the activities of the debtor. In such case, certain transactions are either subject to the recovery administrator's approval or may be performed only by the recovery administrator. Unsecured creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) wishing to assert their claims against the debtor must participate in the insolvency proceedings and must file their claims with the competent court within the time period prescribed by the court order regarding the opening of insolvency proceedings. At the so-called examination hearing (Prüfungstagsatzung), which is held at the competent court, the insolvency administrator must declare, in respect of each of the claims filed with the court, whether the insolvency administrator acknowledges or contests the claim. If the insolvency administrator acknowledges a creditor's claim, such creditor will be entitled to participate in the insolvency proceedings and the pro rata distribution of the insolvency quota (Insolvenzquote) to unsecured creditors that will follow. If the insolvency administrator contests a creditor's claim, the creditor will have to seek enforcement of its claim in civil proceedings and only then participate in the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, claims of unsecured creditors that were created before the opening of the proceedings (Insolvenzforderungen) rank _pari passu with each other. Certain claims that lawfully arise against the insolvency estate after the opening of the proceedings (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings), so-called privileged claims (Masseforderungen), enjoy priority in the insolvency proceedings and rank prior to all other unsecured claims. Claims that are secured by in rem security (such as by a pledge), so-called preferential claims (Absonderungsrechte), are entitled to preferential payment in the distribution of the proceeds resulting from the realization of the charged asset. Creditors who have a right to preferential treatment may participate in the pro rata distribution to the unsecured creditors only to the extent that the proceeds from the realization of the assets charged to them did not cover their claims or if they have waived their right to preferential treatment. Secured creditors do not have a voting right with respect to the approval of the recovery plan to the extent their claim is covered by security. Claims relating to the payment of taxes, social security contributions and employee compensation are not, as such, privileged or preferential claims under Austrian law. Claims of creditors with a right of segregation of assets (Aussonderungsberechtigte), such as creditors with a retention of title or trustors (Treugeber), remain unaffected by the opening of insolvency proceedings. However, according to the Austrian Insolvency Act, a request for preferential realization (Absonderung) of pledged assets of a debtor that are essential for the continuation of the debtor's business or the exercise of a right of segregation of assets (Aussonderungsrecht) in relation to such assets cannot be made within a period of six months from the opening of insolvency proceedings, unless, inter _alia, the preferential realization (Absonderung) of pledged assets is necessary to prevent the contractual_ counterparty from incurring severe personal or economic damages. Once insolvency proceedings have been opened, it is no longer possible to obtain an execution lien with respect to assets belonging to the insolvency estate. All execution proceedings against the debtor are subject to an automatic stay (Vollstreckungssperre). Execution liens obtained within the last 60 days before the opening of insolvency proceedings expire upon the opening of such insolvency proceedings (subject to certain exemptions), unless the insolvency proceedings are terminated because the insolvency estate is ----- insufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Execution liens obtained within the last twelve months may be subject to voidance law. The Austrian Insolvency Act provides that, for a period of six months from the opening of insolvency proceedings, contractual counterparties of the debtor may only terminate contracts for cause (subject to certain exemptions). In this context, the deterioration of the economic situation or the lack of timely performance by the debtor prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings is not considered as sufficient cause. This restriction only applies if the termination of a contract would jeopardize the continuation of the debtor's business. No restrictions apply if the termination of a contract is necessary to prevent the contractual counterparty from incurring severe personal or economic damage. Further, the Austrian Insolvency Act provides that a contractual provision that entitles the other party to withdraw from an agreement or that provides for automatic termination in the event of the opening of insolvency proceedings is not enforceable (subject to certain exemptions for certain derivatives and other financial transactions). Powers of attorney granted by the insolvent debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The Austrian Business Reorganization Act regulates the reorganization of companies in temporary financial distress in order to enable them to continue to do business after having undergone a reorganization procedure. The Austrian Business Reorganisation Act is therefore not designed to assist creditors in satisfying their claims, but rather to support the reorganization of the debtor's business. A business reorganization procedure may be opened if a substantial and sustainable deterioration of the quota of own funds (Eigenmittelquote) may be certifiably anticipated. Only the debtor may apply for the opening of a reorganization procedure, provided, however, that it is not insolvent at the time of its application. Failure to timely apply for the opening of reorganization proceedings may result in personal liability of the representatives of the relevant corporation. A company is deemed to be in need of reorganization if it has (i) a quota of own funds (Eigenmittelquote) of less than 8% and a fictitious duration of debt repayment (fiktive Schuldentilgungsdauer) of more than 15 years, each as defined in, and determined in accordance with, the Austrian Business Reorganization Act. Pursuant to the Austrian Business Reorganization Act, a contractual provision that entitles the other party to withdraw from an agreement or that provides for its automatic termination or the maturity of a disbursed loan facility in the event of the opening of reorganization proceedings is not permissible.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Legal entities and natural persons, insofar as they operate a business, may apply for restructuring proceedings (Restrukturierungsverfahren) as debtors if insolvency is probable (wahrscheinliche Insolvenz). Insolvency is considered probable, if the existence of the debtor's business would be at risk without restructuring, especially if illiquidity is imminent (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit). Probable insolvency is presumed if the quota of own funds (Eigenmittelquote) is less than 8% and the fictitious duration of debt repayment (fiktive Schuldentilgungsdauer) is more than 15 years. Restructuring proceedings may only be opened upon application by the debtor. The debtor must show the existence of probable insolvency in the application. The Austrian Restructuring Code generally provides for the debtor's self-administration for the conduct of the proceedings. However, the court may prohibit the debtor from performing certain legal acts during the ongoing proceedings without the consent of the court or a court-appointed restructuring administrator. The core of the restructuring proceedings is the restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan). In this plan, the debtor must present concise restructuring measures, the duration and the effects of the restructuring. It must also contain a financial plan, a conditional going concern forecast and a comparative calculation of insolvency scenarios. In the restructuring plan, the debtor must present a proposal for the effects of the restructuring, in particular the intended haircut on the various creditor classes. The following creditor classes may be included in the plan: (i) secured creditors, (ii) unsecured creditors, (iii) bondholders, (iv) creditors in need of protection (with claims of less than €10,000), and (v) subordinated creditors. A ----- majority of the affected creditors (present at the meeting) in each class (head majority) and a capital majority of 75% of the affected creditors (present at the meeting) in each class are required to adopt the restructuring plan. If a restructuring plan is approved by the required majorities, it must also be confirmed by the court. If a class of creditors rejects the restructuring plan, the court may nevertheless confirm the restructuring plan at the debtor's request in a cross-class cramdown. A rejecting creditor may apply for a review of the plan as to whether such creditor would be worse off as a result of the restructuring plan than in an alternative insolvency proceeding. If such a request has been made, the court may only confirm an accepted restructuring plan if this test shows that creditors are better off with the restructuring plan. Amongst other things, the exercise of rights and their enforcement may be restricted under the Austrian Reorganization Act. For example, and without limitation, (i) upon the acceptance and confirmation of a restructuring plan, claims may be restructured (e.g., by way of a payment deferral (Stundung) or a reduction in the value of the relevant claims (Forderungskürzung)) even without the consent of or against the affected creditors, subject to certain conditions to be met, (ii) during restructuring proceedings, individual enforcement actions may be stayed (Vollstreckungssperre) for a period of three up to a maximum of six months, and (iii) during restructuring proceedings, subject to certain conditions to be met and exceptions (e.g., for certain derivatives and other financial transactions), creditors may not withhold performance or terminate, accelerate or otherwise modify material contracts yet to be performed (wesentliche noch zu _erfüllende Verträge) to the detriment of the relevant debtor on the basis of a contractual clause providing_ for such measures solely by reason of, for example, the opening of restructuring proceedings or the fulfilment of the requirements for the opening of restructuring proceedings. Shareholders are subject to a general obligation not to unreasonably prevent restructuring measures. However, shareholders cannot form a class in a restructuring plan in relation to their equity stake in a company, with the consequence that there is no possibility to outvote shareholders in a cross-class cramdown. Therefore, a restructuring plan cannot interfere with their legal and economic position against their will and, for example, a debt-equity swap is not enforceable against the will of the shareholders. New financing included in a court-approved restructuring plan or interim financing approved by the court as well as other transactions closely related to the restructuring (especially those necessary for the continuation of the business) shall only be subject to limited avoidance actions in possible subsequent insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzverfahren). In particular, avoidance protection applies if the opposing party did not know about the debtor's illiquidity. The Austrian Reorganization Act also provides for a simplified fast-track restructuring procedure, which can be used by the debtor if only financial creditors will be subject to the proposed restructuring measures. In such a simplified procedure, the debtor remains entirely in possession (no court-appointed restructuring administrator is appointed). Further, creditors are not required to vote on a restructuring plan in a court hearing. Instead, the debtor submits to the court a restructuring agreement that has already been signed by at least a 75% majority of the aggregate amount of claims in each class of financial creditors (no majority based on headcount is required). Ultimately, such a restructuring agreement may be approved by the court without the initiation of formal restructuring proceedings. Thus, it is also not possible to apply for an enforcement stay in these fast-track proceedings. A cross-class cram-down will most likely not be possible in such proceedings. Restructuring proceedings pursuant to the Austrian Reorganization Act, which do not qualify as European restructuring proceedings (Europäisches _Restrukturierungsverfahren), are not published in publicly available registers or data bases.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

In particular, this may be the case if insolvency proceedings are opened (see the discussion on ""centre of main interests"" above). Such a court-appointed trustee may be appointed upon the request of an interested party (e.g., a noteholder) or upon the initiative of the competent court in case of insolvency. The court-appointed trustee has the exclusive right to exercise the collective rights of the noteholders on their behalf. Consequently, an individual noteholder may not bring individual action unless the matter concerns a special relationship between such individual noteholder and the issuer. Noteholders ----- are not able to direct the actions taken on their behalf by the court-appointed trustee.

In particular, it provides that a loan granted by a (direct or indirect) shareholder to a company in a financial crisis (i.e., if the company is illiquid, over-indebted or meets the requirements for a business reorganization procedure) is deemed to be equity replacing. Equity replacing shareholder loans may not be repaid as long as the crisis subsists and any security interest granted in connection with such loans may not be enforced. This means, in particular, that in the event of insolvency of the subsidiary, the respective claims of the shareholder lender are subordinated and rights of segregation of assets (Aussonderungsrecht) or preferential satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) out of the subsidiary's assets securing such claims of the shareholder lender expire upon the opening of insolvency proceedings of the subsidiary. A shareholder is defined as, inter alia, (i) a shareholder with a controlling participation, (ii) a shareholder with a participation of at least 25%, and (iii) any person who does not hold a participation in the borrower but has a controlling influence (beherrschenden Einfluss) over the borrower. Furthermore, _inter alia, a person granting a loan/credit to a company is to be considered a shareholder, inter alia, if (i) it_ holds a participation or other rights in a person other than the borrowing company which allows it to exercise a controlling influence (beherrschenden Einfluss) over the borrowing company (indirect controlling participation), or (ii) it indirectly holds a participation in the borrowing company of at least 33%, or (iii) it holds a controlling direct or indirect participation in a company which holds a participation of at least 25% in the borrowing company.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

These rules protect the assets of the Austrian Guarantor for the benefit of its creditors. The entire set of corporate assets, even those exceeding the registered share capital, is protected by the Austrian capital maintenance rules. Austrian capital maintenance rules prohibit corporations or limited partnerships of which the general partner/s is or are corporations, from disbursing its assets to its shareholders or to another group company (not being a direct or indirect 100% subsidiary) in circumstances other than as a distribution of profits (if, to the extent and as long as available for distribution under Austrian law), by a reduction of share capital or as liquidation surplus on liquidation of that corporations. Guarantees granted by an Austrian corporation or limited partnership (the unlimited liability partner of which is a corporation) in order to guarantee liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements and are thus invalid and unenforceable if the granting of such guarantees by the Austrian entity is not in its best interest and not fully justified by a business purpose (i.e., not to its corporate benefit (betrieblich _gerechtfertigt)). Austrian corporate law does not recognize group interest and thus any corporate benefit_ (betriebliche Rechtfertigung) must be tested at the level of the individual Austrian subsidiary; a benefit solely for the Group (but not for the individual Austrian subsidiary) would not be sufficient. Any transaction that violates Austrian capital maintenance rules is a prohibited repayment of equity (verbotene Einlagenrückgewähr) and as such null and void. This nullity may also affect third parties (e.g., noteholders) if such third party knew or should have known (gross negligence) that the respective transaction was not permitted pursuant to Austrian capital maintenance rules. Therefore, in order to enable Austrian subsidiaries to provide a guarantee with respect to liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company and in order to reduce the risk of violating the Austrian capital maintenance rules and the resulting invalidity and unenforceability, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements and guarantees to contain so-called ""limitation language"" with respect to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Austria. Pursuant to such limitation language, the upstream and sidestream provision of guarantees by Austrian subsidiaries is limited to the extent necessary to avoid a ----- breach of the Austrian capital maintenance rules. Accordingly, the Note Guarantee granted by the Austrian Guarantor will be subject to standard limitation language included in the Indenture (or a supplemental indenture) stating, _inter alia, that all obligations and/or liabilities thereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount permitted under the Austrian capital maintenance rules (which amount may be zero or close to zero). No case law is available to confirm and it is thus not certain whether the limitations set forth in the Indenture (or a supplemental indenture), in particular regarding the limitation of the amount guaranteed to an amount permitted under the Austrian capital maintenance rules, would be valid and enforceable under Austrian law and achieve the desired effect of legally preserving the Note Guarantee to the extent permitted under the under Austrian capital maintenance rules or whether the Note Guarantee would be deemed void in its entirety. Moreover, Austrian capital maintenance rules are subject to ongoing court decisions, and it cannot be ruled out that future court rulings may further limit the access of creditors and/or shareholders to assets of subsidiaries incorporated in Austria and constituted in the form of a corporation or of a limited partnership the general partner or general partners of which is or are corporations. _Hardening Periods and Clawback_ Under the voidance rules of the Austrian Insolvency Act, an insolvency administrator may, by action of voidance or by defense of voidance, under certain circumstances, challenge any transaction (which term for the purposes of this section ""Hardening Periods and Clawback"" includes, without limitation, the granting of security and the guaranteeing, assuming and/or paying of debt). In particular, the following transactions are voidable with respect to the insolvent entity's creditors: - Voidance due to intent of discrimination (Anfechtung wegen Benachteiligungsabsicht): All transactions performed or entered into by the debtor within ten years prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings with the intent known to the other party to discriminate against its creditors as well as all transactions entered into by the debtor with the intent to discriminate against its creditors and which it performed or entered into during the last two years prior to commencement of insolvency proceedings, provided that the beneficiary of the transaction should have been aware of such intent of the debtor. If the legal act was concluded with or for the benefit of certain connected persons (as defined by law) the burden of proof regarding the knowledge of the intention to discriminate is shifted to that connected person (i.e., the connected person must prove that they had no knowledge and was not negligent in having no knowledge, respectively). Should the debtor be a legal entity capable of being a party in a lawsuit, then members of the managing and supervisory bodies of the debtor as well as the debtor's shareholders with unlimited liability and the debtor's controlling shareholder or ""shareholders"" within the definitions of the Austrian Act on Equity Replacements (Eigenkapitalersatzgesetz) (i.e., in particular shareholders controlling the debtor or holding a stake of at least 25% or other persons who are not shareholders but exercise a controlling influence comparable to a majority shareholder) are deemed to be connected. - Voidance due to squandering of assets (Anfechtung wegen Vermögensverschleuderung): Delivery, purchase and barter transactions undertaken by the debtor in the last year prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings are voidable, if the other party perceived or should have perceived such creditor discriminating squandering of assets by the debtor through transactions below market value. - Voidance of transactions with no consideration and analogous transactions (Anfechtung _unentgeltlicher oder ihnen gleichgestellter Verfügungen): In particular, transactions of the debtor_ without consideration (except customary occasional gifts and transactions for a reasonable and proportionate amount towards a charitable cause or for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, a moral duty or consideration of decency) and acquisitions of property from the debtor by order of authority if paid out of the debtor's funds are voidable, if performed or entered into in the last two years prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. - Voidance due to preferential treatment (Anfechtung wegen Begünstigung): Security or payment (Befriedigung oder Sicherstellung) given to a creditor (i) after the occurrence of the debtor's illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or (ii) after filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or (iii) in the last 60 days before each of (i) or (ii) is voidable, if (i) the creditor obtained a security or payment it was not entitled to or not entitled to ----- in this particular manner or at that particular time (in this case no further subjective elements are required on the part of the creditor receiving the security or payment), (ii) the security or payment was given to persons who were aware or should have been aware of the intent of the debtor to treat them preferential ahead of the debtor's other creditors, or (iii) the transaction was effected for the benefit of a connected person, unless such connected person (as defined by law, see above) did not know and should not have known about the debtor's intention to give preferential treatment. A grant of security or payment under such circumstances is not voidable if the preferential treatment was given more than one year prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. The burden of proof is reversed if a security or payment is provided to a connected person. - Voidance due to knowledge of the debtor's insolvency (Anfechtung wegen Kenntnis der _Zahlungsunfähigkeit): Any transaction performed or entered into after the occurrence of the_ debtor's illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or over-indebtedness (Überschuldung), each within the meaning of the Austrian Insolvency Act, or after the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings may be challenged if: - such transaction constitutes payment or granting of security (Befriedigung oder _Sicherstellung) to a connected person (as defined by law, see above), or any other_ transaction entered into by the debtor with such connected person which is considered to be prejudicial to the debtor's creditors (nachteilige Rechtsgeschäfte), unless (i) with respect to such payment or granting of security, or to a transaction directly prejudicial to the debtor's creditors, such connected person did not have nor should have had knowledge of the debtor's inability to pay debts, over-indebtedness or the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and (ii) with respect to a transaction indirectly prejudicial to the debtor's creditors, the negative effect of such transaction on the insolvency estate was not objectively foreseeable at the time of entering into the transaction; - such transaction constitutes payment or granting of security (Befriedigung oder _Sicherstellung) to a creditor, or any other transaction entered into by the debtor with a_ third party which is directly prejudicial (unmittelbar nachteilig) to the debtor's creditors, provided that the debtor's counterparty knew or should have known of the debtor's inability to pay debts, over-indebtedness or the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; and - entered into by the debtor with a third party which is indirectly prejudicial (mittelbar _nachteilig) to the debtor's creditors, provided that (i) the debtor's counterparty knew or_ should have known of the debtor's inability to pay debts, over-indebtedness or the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and (ii) such transaction's negative effect on the insolvency estate was objectively foreseeable at the time of entering into the transaction. Such transaction's negative effect is foreseeable, in particular, when a recovery effort is obviously unsuitable (offensichtlich untaugliches Sanierungskonzept). A transaction is considered to be indirectly prejudicial (mittelbar nachteilig) if, even though it may be objectively balanced (i.e., not directly prejudicial to the debtor's creditors), it nonetheless has a negative effect on the recovery rate of unsecured creditors. Transactions carried out more than six months prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings may not be voided due to knowledge of the debtor's insolvency (Anfechtung wegen Kenntnis der Zahlungsunfähigkeit). The relevant hardening/suspect periods will be extended by the term of a reorganization proceeding if such reorganization proceeding terminates within the relevant hardening/suspect periods. See ""Business _Reorganization Proceedings.""_ In addition to an insolvency administrator voiding transactions according to the Austrian Insolvency Act, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any transactions pursuant to the provisions of the Austrian Enforcement Code (Exekutionsordnung) outside of formal insolvency proceedings. The conditions for such action vary to a certain extent from the rules described above, and the voidance periods commence from the date on which such other creditor exercises its voidance rights in court. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Stampdutiable transactions include, for example, sureties, assignments, lease agreements and mortgages. Under the Austrian Stamp Duty Act, stamp duty on, for example, - sureties (Bürgschaften) as well as assumptions of liabilities as joint debtor (Schuldbeitritt) amounts to 1% of the secured amount (depending on the wording of a guarantee, a guarantee may be treated as a surety for stamp duty purposes); and - assignments or transfers of receivables or other rights amounts to 0.8% of the consideration for the assignment or transfer, or, in a case of an assignment for security (Sicherungszession), to 0.8% of the lower of either the secured amount or the value of the assigned receivables. Stampdutiable transactions for security (in particular sureties, assignments, mortgages) may be exempt from stamp duty if such transaction (exclusively and directly) secures the credit-claims (including interest and possibly typical ancillary charges) of a lender or creditor against a borrower under a loan or credit agreement (which, for the purposes of the Austrian Stamp Duty Act, includes such claims against an issuer under a bond issue). In light of this and to reduce the risk of triggering stamp duty with respect to the Austrian Guarantor's Note Guarantee, the Austrian Guarantor's Note Guarantee and certain other indemnities and assumptions of liabilities by the Austrian Guarantor will be limited to guaranteeing/securing claims that are considered such credit-claims. Note that this exemption will not apply, inter alia, with respect to other security (including the Note Guarantees, indemnities and assumptions of liability of the other Guarantors) for the Notes or the Debt Documents, which will not be limited to such credit-claims. As a general rule, Austrian stamp duty is triggered if a document on a stampdutiable transaction is created in Austria and such transaction is not exempt from stamp duty. Under certain circumstances, also the creation of a document on a stampdutiable transaction outside of Austria may trigger stamp duty. Stamp duty may thus be triggered for a document created outside of Austria if (i) the parties to the transaction are resident for stamp duty purposes in Austria (Austrian residence, place of habitual abode, seat, place of effective management or permanent establishment) and (ii) the transaction concerns an Austrian situated asset or a party to the transaction is entitled or obliged to performance under the transaction in Austria. If the creation of a document outside of Austria did not trigger Austrian stamp duty, stamp duty may be triggered if the document (or a certified copy thereof) is brought into or sent to Austria and (i) the transaction concerns an Austrian situated asset or a party to the transaction is entitled or obliged to performance under the transaction in Austria, or (ii) a legally relevant action is taken in Austria based on the transaction or official use of the document (or a certified copy thereof) is made in Austria. Austrian stamp duty may also be triggered by a document that refers to a stampdutiable transaction in a qualified manner (so called confirming document; rechtsbezeugende Urkunde). According to the Austrian Federal Ministry of Finance, a confirming document is constituted if the parties to and the nature of the transaction referred to may be derived from the document. Such document may (already) trigger Austrian stamp duty if signed by one of the parties and sent to the other party or its representative (or, in case of a transaction under which both parties are obliged to performance, a third party to furnish proof of the underlying transaction). Furthermore, stamp duty may be triggered by a so-called substitute document (Ersatzurkunde; (e.g., a signed protocol on an orally agreed transaction)) on a stampdutiable transaction or a document that incorporates by reference a document on a (concluded) stampdutiable transaction. If Austrian stamp duty is triggered, pursuant to the Austrian Stamp Duty Act generally the parties to the transaction are jointly and severally liable for Austrian stamp duty triggered. In case of a transaction under which only one party is obliged to performance (e.g., a surety), the party in whose interest the document was created is liable for the stamp duty (e.g., the beneficiary of a surety) (section 28(1) of the Austrian Stamp Duty Act). In any case, the other party (as well as, if the competent tax office is not duly notified of the stampdutiable transaction, the persons who would be responsible for such notification) would be ----- secondarily liable for the stamp duty triggered. Agreements between the parties as to who shall bear stamp duty if triggered are not relevant for the tax authorities but may be honoured by the tax authorities within their discretion. If stamp duty was triggered and not duly paid or the competent tax office was not duly notified of a stampdutiable transaction, the competent tax office may, within its discretion, increase the amount of stamp duty due by up to 100% depending on whether the taxpayer could have recognized that stamp duty was triggered, the notification was made with slight or substantial delay, or provisions of the Austrian Stamp Duty Act have been infringed for the first time or repeatedly. Because, inter alia, the Debt Documents will contain certain guarantees (including the Note Guarantees) and possibly certain security assignments and will provide for the accession of the Guarantors as joint and several obligors under some of the Debt Documents, the Debt Documents will be signed outside of Austria and will provide for certain precautions regarding the bringing of the documents into Austria and referring to the documents in correspondence (including emails) in Austria in order to reduce the risk of triggering Austrian stamp duty. In addition, several of the Debt Documents (including the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) will include a place of performance provision, specifying that the place of performance (Erfüllungsort) for all rights and obligations under these Debt Documents shall be outside of Austria.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

In the event of an insolvency of a Belgian Obligor, main insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Belgium; provided that Belgium is the territory in which the Belgian Obligor's ""centre of main interests"" is situated. Such proceedings would then be governed by Belgian law. Under certain circumstances, Belgian law also allows secondary bankruptcy proceedings to be opened in Belgium over the assets of companies whose ""centre of main interests"" is not situated in Belgium. The effects of those secondary proceedings are restricted to the assets situated in Belgium. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Belgian insolvency law. Belgian insolvency laws provide for three primary insolvency procedures: (i) a judicial reorganization procedure (gerechtelijke reorganisatie/réorganisation judiciaire),(ii) transfer of business under judicial authority and (iii)a bankruptcy procedure (faillissement/faillite). The three types of insolvency proceedings are governed by Book XX ""Insolvency of enterprises"" of the Belgian Code of Economic Law. Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law distinguishes between ""private"" and ""public"" reorganization proceedings, aimed at reaching either (i) an amicable settlement between the debtor and two or more of its creditors; or (ii) a collective agreement. Transfer of (part) of the activities is now classified as a liquidation procedure, and no longer as a procedure aimed at preserving the ""continuity"" of the business. The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also depend on the position of the court and/or third parties. As of June 7, 2023, Belgium has implemented the EU Restructuring Directive through a newly enacted law (the ""New Belgian Restructuring Law""). The New Belgian Restructuring Law entered into force on September 1, 2023. The new law significantly alters the Belgian restructuring framework by introducing new reorganization proceedings and amending the conditions for the application of certain existing procedures. These changes will be further assessed below. In addition, Belgian law allows for a liquidation in deficit (deficitaire vereffening/liquidation déficitaire). The latter proceeding will not be further discussed.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The interpretation of this principle is broad and defined by the courts. The fact that the conditions for bankruptcy are met (entailing that the debtor has the obligation to file for bankruptcy pursuant to Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law) does not preclude the debtor from applying for a judicial reorganization. ----- The petition for judicial reorganization, to be filed with the clerk office of the relevant Enterprise Court, must include the contemplated measures and proposals that will be taken or made by the debtor to carry out the reorganization. Further, the petition must be accompanied by a number of documents, including, but not limited to, an interim balance sheet and income statement, prepared under the supervision of an auditor, an external expert accountant or a certified tax accountant. The court may however review and, as the case may be, grant a petition to open judicial reorganization proceedings where the debtor has been unable to provide certain required documents. As from the filing of the petition with the relevant Enterprise Court overseeing the judicial reorganization and for as long as such court has not issued a judgment on the reorganization petition, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt (save in case the debtor files a declaration of bankruptcy itself) or wound up by court order. In addition, during this period between the filing of the petition and the court's decision, subject to certain exceptions, none of the debtor's assets may be disposed of by any of its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests that such creditors may hold with respect to such assets. If the debtor requested the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings less than twelve months ago and such request was granted, the filing of the petition does not have a suspensory effect, except if the court decides otherwise. Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides that, within a period of 15 days as from the filing of the petition, the court will hear the debtor and/or his or her legal counsel on the petition for reorganization and will hear the report from the delegated judge. After such hearing, the court will rule within eight days on the petition for judicial reorganization. If the conditions for judicial reorganization appear to be met, and all required documents have been provided, the court will declare the judicial reorganization procedure open, allowing a temporary moratorium for a maximum period of four months. At the request of the debtor and pursuant to the report issued by the delegated judge, the moratorium period can thereafter be extended without the total duration of the moratorium exceeding twelve months, and only in exceptional circumstances (such as due to the size of the business, the complexity of the case or the impact of the procedure on employment). The extension of the moratorium must not excessively prejudice the interests of the parties affected, especially creditors. The granting of the temporary moratorium operates as a stay on enforcement. No enforcement measures with respect to pre-existing claims in the moratorium can be continued or initiated against any of the debtor's assets from the time that the moratorium is granted until the end of the period, with limited exceptions. Furthermore, during the moratorium, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt or wound up by court order. During the duration of the moratorium, no attachments can be made with regard to pre-existing claims. Creditors however retain the possibility to be granted legal or contractual security. Conservatory attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization retain their conservatory character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have a material adverse effect on the situation of the creditor concerned. If the date for the forced sale of moveable or immovable property has already been set, such sale may, under certain conditions, be continued. Personal guarantees granted by third parties in favor of the debtor's creditors are not covered by the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, nor are the debts payable by co-debtors, subject to certain exceptions or qualifications in respect of guarantees granted by individuals. The moratorium also does not prevent the voluntary payment by the debtor of claims covered by the moratorium to the extent such payment is necessary for the continuity of the enterprise. During the judicial reorganization procedure, the board of directors and management of the debtor in principle continue to exercise their management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of the court. However, upon request of the debtor or any interested party and insofar as the reorganization is intended to achieve a collective agreement, the court may, if the protection of the interested parties so requires, appoint a restructuring practitioner (herstructureringsdeskundige / _praticien de la réorganisation) to assist the debtor or creditors in the negotiation and drafting of the reorganization plan or to facilitate the conclusion of an amicable settlement. The court may also appoint a liquidation practitioner (praticien de la liquidation/ _vereffeningsdeskundige), upon the request of the debtor or any interested party or the public prosecutor, in_ the event of significant shortcomings (kennelijk tekortkomingen/manquements caractérisés) of the debtor or any of its corporate bodies threatening the continuity of the enterprise facing difficulties or its economic activities and provided such measure can preserve such continuity, to either exercise particular tasks indicated by the court, or to replace the debtor or any of its corporate bodies for the duration of the moratorium. In addition, in the event of manifestly gross negligence (kennelijk grove fout/faute grave et _caractérisée), the court may, upon the request of any interested party or the public prosecutor (by joint_ ----- application), or upon its own initiative (in case of emergency) appoint a temporary administrator (voorlopig _bewindvoerder/administrateur provisoire) replacing the debtor's corporate bodies for the duration of the_ moratorium and charged with the management of the debtor. Furthermore, upon request of any interested party or upon its own initiative, the court may decide that the company loses all or part of the management of all or part of its assets or activities and appoint a restructuring practicioner in case of important, precise and consistent indications (gewichtige, bepaalde en met elkaar overeenstemmende _aanwijzigingen/indices _graves, précis et concordants) that the conditions for bankruptcy are met._ The delegated judge, appointed by the court to assist the debtor in achieving the goal of the reorganization, has additional powers, including the power to advise the court to end the reorganization procedure prematurely if he or she considers that the debtor is clearly not in a state to ensure the continuity of the whole or part of his or her business. The reorganization procedure aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern. Consequently, the initiation of the judicial reorganization proceedings does not terminate any contracts. Contractual provisions that provide for the early termination or acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or approval of a reorganization procedure, and certain contractual terms such as default interest, may not be enforceable during such a procedure. Such enforcement prohibition applies, with a few exceptions, to close-out netting provisions as well if the judicial reorganization procedure affects (i) a corporate debtor which is not a public or financial legal entity within the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act or (ii) a public or financial legal entity but where the creditor itself is not such an entity. Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract on the basis of a debtor's default that occurred prior to the reorganization procedure if the debtor remedies such default within a 15-day period following the notification of such default after the opening of the proceedings. As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract (except employment contracts) during the reorganization procedure; provided that the debtor notifies the creditor, and the decision is necessary for the debtor to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer all or part of the enterprise or its assets. The exercise of this right does not prevent the creditor, however, from suspending in turn the performance of its own obligations. However, the creditor cannot terminate the agreement solely on the ground that the debtor has suspended the performance of its own obligations. _(Out of court) Amicable Settlement_ In the past, in the case of an amicable settlement as provided by Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law, the debtor could draw up an agreement and joint payment scheme plan with at least two creditors in order to settle its debts. The New Belgian Restructuring law innovates allowing that an amicable settlement can be concluded with one creditor instead of at least two. The debtor may petition the court to grant a grace period in respect of its payment obligations (e.g., in relation to interest payments), pending the negotiation of the agreement. Only the parties to the amicable settlement will be bound by the terms they have agreed. If an agreement is reached for reorganization purposes, it is submitted to the court and entered into a register. Any party may ask the court to confirm the out of court amicable settlement in order to obtain an enforceable title (and not only the debtor alone). In addition, the court will carry out a review of the amicable settlement. This (marginal) control consists in verifying that the provisions of the agreement comply with the formalities established by law and that the settlement does not violate public order. The court's approval concludes the procedure. Such an amicable settlement will remain enforceable in the event of a later bankruptcy, subject to certain exceptions. The court can impose a binding payment plan on creditors with whom an amicable settlement could not be concluded. _Collective Agreement_ In the case of a judicial reorganization by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a restructuring plan during the reorganization procedure. One of the key features of the New Belgian Restructuring Law is the creation of a twofold regime for public judicial reorganization by collective agreement: one for large companies, and one for small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs). _SMEs_ ----- For SMEs, the current proceedings will largely continue to apply. An SME is defined as a company which, alone or on a consolidated basis with their controlled entities, does not exceed two of any of the below thresholds during two consecutive financial years: (i) it employs maximally 250 employees; (ii) it has a net turnover of €40 million; or (iii) it has a total balance sheet of €20 million. The debtor must prepare a reorganization plan in which it includes a list of its creditors and the amount of their claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the debtor, as well as details regarding security interests, if applicable. Creditors with pre-existing claims, as well as any other interested party that claims to be a creditor, can challenge the amounts and the ranking of the secured claims declared by the debtor. The court can determine the disputed amounts and the ranking of such claims on a preliminary basis for the purpose of the reorganization procedure or definitively, on the condition that it has jurisdiction in that respect but that the decision relating to the dispute cannot be taken in a sufficiently short time frame. In addition, the court can, at any time, in the event of absolute necessity and upon the request of the debtor or the creditor, change the amount and the ranking of the claim initially declared by the debtor on the basis of new elements at the latest 15 days before the date on which the creditors will vote on the reorganization plan. If a creditor has not challenged the amount and the ranking of its claim at least one month in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the reorganization plan, the amount of its claim will remain unchanged for voting purposes as well as for the purposes of the reorganization plan. The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a reorganization plan, with the assistance of the court-appointed administrator or enterprise mediator, as the case may be. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the conversion of debt into equity (Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law contains certain limitations, primarily in view of protecting employees of the debtor) and may be based on a differentiated treatment of various categories of creditors. The maximum duration of the plan is five years. The reorganization plan must be filed with the electronic registry managed by the Belgian bar associations (www.regsol.be) at least 20 days in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote its approval. The court needs to ratify the reorganization plan prior to its taking effect. A reorganization plan approved by a double majority of the creditors (both in headcount and in principal amount due) and ratified by the court will bind the debtor and all creditors, including those who voted against it or did not vote and whether secured or not. The reorganization plan can bind creditors who have a contractual lien over specific assets, pledgees, mortgagees, and the so-called creditor-owners; provided that (i) interest is paid on the principal amount of their outstanding debts and (ii) their rights are not suspended for more than 24 months as of the ratification of the collective agreement by the court. Subject to certain conditions, this period of 24 months may be extended by another twelve months. No other measures can be imposed on such creditors without their individual agreement. The court may refuse ratification if the conditions of the judicial reorganization proceeding were not met or if the proposed reorganization plan violates public policy. SME's may however choose to opt-in for the large companies' regime (see next section). The choice to opt in for the new regime is solely at the discretion of the debtor. _Large companies_ The New Belgian Restructuring Law provides for a new reorganization regime for collective agreements for large companies (i.e., companies which, for a period of two consecutive years, have either (i) 250 or more employees, (ii) an annual turnover exceeding €40 million, or (iii) a balance sheet total exceeding €20 million), which was already introduced by an amendment to Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law dated March 26, 2021. In the more complex reorganization regime for large companies, creditors are divided into separate classes based on their respective rights in a liquidation scenario and/or the rights conferred on them in the proposed reorganization plan. Equity holders form a separate class. The plan is approved if a majority of each class (in value of the claims in principal and interest) approves it. There is a double test to ""cramdown"" dissenting (classes of) creditors. First, the ""best-interest-of-creditors test"" applies, meaning that no dissenting creditor can be manifestly worse off under the reorganization plan than in a liquidation scenario. Second, a ""crossclass cramdown"" to impose the plan on non-consenting classes is only possible if additional criteria are met, more particularly: (i) if there are two classes, one of the two classes must approve the plan; (ii) if there are more than two classes, a majority of the classes of parties affected by the plan must approve it (including at least the class of secured creditors or a class ranking ahead of the class of ordinary creditors, or if that is not the case, at least one class of creditors who could reasonably be expected to receive payment if the normal order of priority in liquidation were to be applied); and (iii) the plan cannot derogate to the detriment of any of the dissenting categories from the existing legal or contractual priority that would apply in the ----- context of a liquidation, unless there would be a reasonable basis for such a derogation and the relevant creditors or equity holders are not manifestly disadvantaged as a result of such derogation. The creation of classes and new voting mechanics imply that valuation discussions will become increasingly important in the context of reorganization proceedings. Distressed debtors and their creditors may hence need to involve financial advisors at an early stage to avoid challenges and/or protect their interests. _Private Insolvency Procedure_ The New Belgian Restructuring Law introduced a ""private"" (or confidential) insolvency procedure, allowing the debtor to confidentially test the possibility of a court assisted amicable arrangement or a collective agreement with creditors, outside the scope of formal judicial reorganization proceedings. During the negotiation phase, only a limited moratorium may be put in place which may not exceed four months and by means of which the court may subject unwilling or malicious creditors to payment terms and enforcement measures for certain creditors may be suspended. Unlike the ""regular"" public judicial reorganization procedure, the private judicial reorganization procedure does not trigger an automatic and general stay of individual enforcement actions. If the negotiations are successful, the pre-pack proceedings may be transformed into formal judicial reorganization proceedings to have the amicable arrangement sanctioned or the collective agreement put to vote on an expedited timetable.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1852,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1852.3,Belgium,1852.3.3,Bankruptcy,"The Belgian bankruptcy procedure is governed by Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law and by case law. Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors or upon the initiative of the public prosecutor's office, or the provisional administrator of the debtor's assets or the liquidator of ""main insolvency proceedings"" opened in another EU member state (other than Denmark) in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation. Conditions for a bankruptcy order (aangifte van faillissement/déclaration de faillite) are that the debtor must be in a situation of cessation of payments (staking van betaling/cessation de paiements) and be unable to obtain further credit (wiens krediet geschokt is/ébranlement de crédit). Cessation of payments is generally considered as the inability of the debtor to pay its debts as they fall due. Such situation must be persistent and not merely temporary. The mere fact that a debtor's liabilities exceed its assets does not mean that the bankruptcy conditions are met. Companies in liquidation can be declared bankrupt up to six months after the judgment closing the liquidation. In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management of the bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver (curator/curateur) becomes responsible for the operation of the business and implements the sale of the debtor's assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor (its decisions being, as the case may be, subject to prior court authorization). The rights of (unsecured) creditors in the process are limited to being informed of the course of the bankruptcy proceedings on a regular basis by the bankruptcy receiver. Creditors may oppose the sale of assets by bringing an action before the court, or may request the temporary continued operation of the business. The bankruptcy receiver must decide whether or not to continue performance of ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The bankruptcy receiver may decide not to continue the performance of one or several contracts, subject to certain limitations, according to case law. The counterparty to an ongoing contract may summon the bankruptcy receiver to take a decision within 15 days. If no extension of the 15-day term is agreed upon or if the bankruptcy receiver does not make any decision, the ongoing contract is presumed to be terminated after the expiration of the 15-day term. If the bankruptcy receiver decides not to continue the performance of an ongoing contract or if an ongoing contract is terminated due to the expiration of the 15-day term, the counterparty to the contract can file a claim for damages against the bankrupt estate, in which case such claim will rank pari passu with the claims of all other unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract dissolved. The counterparty may not seek injunctive relief or require specific performance of the contract. ----- Subject to prior court authorization, the bankruptcy receiver may elect to continue operating the business of the debtor; provided that such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. Two exceptions apply, however: - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an automatic early termination or acceleration event; and - _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the counterparty constitutes an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment, since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can agree to continue to perform under such contracts. As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the court order opening bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy receiver may proceed against the debtor and liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply to a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on account falling within the scope of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act. Further exceptions exist with regard to estate debts (boedelschulden/dettes de la masse). As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on its unsecured debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, such as tax debts or social security debts. The ranking of different types of debt of the bankrupt debtor is determined on the basis of a complex set of rules. The following is a general overview of only the main principles: - Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the bankruptcy receiver during the bankruptcy proceedings, the so-called ""estate debts,"" have a senior priority. In addition, if the bankruptcy receiver has contributed to the realization and enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the bankruptcy receiver in priority out of the proceeds of the realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors. Tax and social security claims incurred during the judicial reorganization proceedings will be preferential debts of the estate in a subsequent liquidation or bankruptcy; - Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured asset (whether by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization); - Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (e.g., tax claims, claims for social security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank ahead of privileges on all assets of the debtor. Certain privileges prevail over security interests (e.g., the privilege for costs made to preserve a certain asset, an unpaid seller's lien etc.); - Unsecured creditors (pari passu): Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of security interests and privileges have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be distributed by the bankruptcy receiver among the unsecured creditors who rank pari passu (unless a creditor agreed to be subordinated); and - Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any). Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides that any assets, amounts and sums of distributions (such as income generated by a new activity) received after a bankruptcy are excluded from the bankruptcy estate if their relevant cause dates from after the bankruptcy. _Pre-Packaged Bankruptcy Procedure_ The New Belgian Restructuring Law also introduced a new regime of private preparation for bankruptcy proceedings. The ""private"" (or confidential) bankruptcy preparation procedure can only be initiated by the debtor. In its petition, the debtor must demonstrate that the confidential pre-bankruptcy proceedings will (i) facilitate the liquidation of the company while achieving the highest possible distribution to the joint creditors, and (ii) preserve jobs to the extent possible. If the court grants the debtor's request, a liquidation practitioner (""vereffeningsdeskundige""/""praticien de la liquidation"") is appointed for a maximum of 30 days (with possible extension to a total of 60 days). The liquidation practitioner will monitor the procedure representing the interests of the creditors, who will generally be appointed as the liquidator in the ensuing ----- bankruptcy procedure. Following the confidential preparation procedure, formal bankruptcy proceedings are opened during which in general the appointed liquidation expert will act as bankruptcy trustee to finalize the negotiated transfer, if any. The legislator aims to avoid the situation of the traditional bankruptcy, which is immediately declared and published (with all the negative consequences of such publicity) and also limit some abuse of self-assignment. According to the most recent case law of the European Court of Justice, the transferee will not be obliged to take over all employees if the agreement is reached in the framework of such pre-pack agreements.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Corporate benefit is not a well-defined concept under Belgian law and its interpretation is left to the courts and legal authors. The corporate benefit rules and their application in the context of granting guarantees or collateral for the benefit of a group company are not clearly established under Belgian law and there is only limited case law on this issue. The question of corporate benefit must be determined on a case-by-case basis by reference to the prevailing factual circumstances. Consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the relevant Belgian company would derive from the transaction and is particularly relevant for upstream or crossstream guarantees and collateral. It is generally argued by legal scholars that such benefit should be proportionally greater than the risk for the relevant Belgian company resulting from the granting and/or enforcement of the guarantee concerned. The financial support granted by a Belgian company should not exceed its financial capabilities. Belgian case law does not offer clear guidelines on when a group transaction is within the individual group member's corporate benefit and when aforementioned conditions are met. Whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact to be assessed by the board of directors of the Belgian Guarantor. The corporate benefit justifications by the Belgian companies' boards of directors will be subject to only a ""marginal review"" by the courts; in insolvency situations, however, the courts can be expected to take a more critical view. If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the relevant company may be held liable (i) by the company for negligence in the management of the company and (ii) by third parties in tort. Moreover, the guarantee or collateral could be declared null and void and, under certain circumstances, the creditor that benefits from the guarantee or collateral could be held liable for up to the amount of the guarantee. Alternatively, the guarantee or collateral could be reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate benefit, or the creditor may be held liable for any guarantee amount in excess of such amount. These rules have seldom been tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on this matter. In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee and collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called ""limitation language"" in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium. Accordingly, the Indenture will contain such limitation language and the Guarantee of the Belgian Guarantor will be so limited. Including such limitation language is, however, not conclusive in determining or upholding the corporate benefit.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The court issuing the bankruptcy order may determine, based on serious and objective indications that the cessation of payments occurred on an earlier date. Such earlier date may not be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order, except in the case where the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was dissolved more than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may be determined to be the date of such decision to dissolve the company. The period from the date of cessation of payments up to the declaration of bankruptcy is referred to as the ""hardening period"" (verdachte periode/période suspecte). The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which will be declared ineffective against third parties and which are unenforceable against the bankruptcy receiver include, among others, (i) gratuitous transactions or transactions where the consideration received is considerably below the value of the act or asset provided by the debtor, (ii) payments for debts which are not due, (iii) payments other than in cash for debts due, and (iv) new security provided for pre-existing debt.

Other transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period may be declared ineffective against third parties, provided that the counterparty was aware of the debtor's cessation of payment (and unless such transactions were entered into as part of an amicable settlement as provided by Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law, whether in the context of formal reorganization proceedings or not). In particular, a guarantee or security interest entered into during the hardening period may be declared ineffective against third parties if (i) it is regarded as having been granted gratuitously or where the consideration received is considerably below the value of the guarantee or security interests provided, (ii) the beneficiaries of the guarantee or security interests were aware of the company's cessation of payments or (iii) (as regards security interests) it is granted for pre-existing debts. If the Guarantee granted by the Belgian Guarantor is successfully voided (based on the considerations above), holders of the Notes would cease to have any claim in respect of such Guarantee and would be under an obligation to repay any amounts received pursuant to such Guarantee. Finally, regardless of any declaration by the Business Court of a hardening period, a third-party creditor may obtain a court ruling that any act or transaction (such as a guarantee) is not enforceable against it if it can establish that the challenged act or transaction was entered into with the fraudulent intent to adversely affect its position as an existing creditor (actio pauliana/action paulienne), irrespective of its date.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

In cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, French insolvency proceedings may also be opened under certain circumstances with respect to companies that are not incorporated in France if they hold an interest in France, whether it be their ""main center of interests"" or a mere establishment. French court-administered insolvency proceedings are either safeguard (sauvegarde), accelerated safeguard (sauvegarde accélérée), reorganization or liquidation proceedings (redressement or liquidation judiciaire). Confidential court-assisted proceedings also exist to help debtors restructure their indebtedness in a consensual manner (namely mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings). Specialized courts exist for conciliation or insolvency proceedings with respect to (i) debtors that exceed (directly or through the companies under their control) (y) €20 million in turnover and 250 employees or (z) €40 million in turnover, (ii) commencement of proceedings pursuant to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation or (iii) in cases where the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply regarding a debtor which is not incorporated in France, commencement of proceedings with respect to which the court's jurisdiction results from the debtor having its main center of interests therein.

Judicial reorganization proceedings are available to companies whose recovery prospects are possible while judicial liquidation proceedings are available to companies whose recovery is manifestly impossible. While a company may file for safeguard proceedings at any time it is facing insurmountable difficulties, it is required to petition for the opening of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings within 45 days of becoming in a state of cessation des paiements. Alternatively, the debtor may request the opening of conciliation proceedings within the same timeframe.

Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is mandatorily appointed for companies that exceed a certain size (at least (i) €3 million of net turnover and (ii) 20 employees) to investigate the business of the debtor during an ""observation period"" (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to twelve months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet _de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circulate among its creditors. Creditors do not have effective control_ over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the court-appointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission d'assistance), all under the supervision of the court. The court may convert such safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings in certain circumstances. Creditors whose rights are affected by the plan must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor's liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business. Standard consultation: this applies to debtors for which the class-based consultation is not mandatory or requested by the debtor with the consent of the insolvency judge (as described below). In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed creditors' representative, who informs each creditor who filed a claim. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively. The duration of the plan is determined by the court and may not exceed ten years, or 15 years in relation to agricultural or maritime fishing businesses. Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved are not required to be consulted. ----- Creditors who do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debt-for-equity-swap proposals) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors' representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and any creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as a controller (contrôleur). Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de _sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals that_ were submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or, for certain claims, the Post Commencement Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor's individual acceptance. Following a court-imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had it been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors. In the third, fourth and fifth year, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim, and at least 10% of the amount of each debt claim as from the sixth year, except for agricultural businesses. Class-based consultation: this applies mandatorily in case of accelerated safeguard proceedings (see below) and, in case of safeguard and judicial reorganization proceedings, to (i) companies that either (x) employ at least 250 employees and have a net turnover of at least €20 million or (y) have a net turnover of at least €40 million, and (ii) companies that own or control another company, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, provided that all the companies together reach the aforementioned thresholds. This could also apply, in case these thresholds are not met, upon the debtor's request (in safeguard proceedings) or upon the debtor's or the judicial administrator's request (in judicial reorganization proceedings), in each case with the consent of the insolvency judge. Only affected parties (parties affectées) are entitled to vote on the draft restructuring plan. These affected parties being (i) creditors whose rights are directly affected by the proposed draft restructuring plan and (ii) equity holders (détenteurs de capital), if their equity interest in the debtor, the articles of association, or their rights are modified by the proposed restructuring plan. The constitution of classes of creditors is made under the responsibility of the judicial administrator, who will, on the basis of objective and verifiable criteria, group within the same class creditors sharing sufficient common economic interest (communauté d'intérêt économique suffisante). Claims taken into account are those indicated by the debtor and certified by its auditor(s) or, in the absence of an auditor, in a certificate from the debtor's certified public accountant. In determining the composition of each class the judicial administrator shall ensure that (i) creditors benefiting from ""rights in rem"" security (sûretés réelles) over the debtor's assets and other creditors are in separate classes, (ii) the determination of each class complies with the subordination arrangements entered into before the opening of the relevant proceedings (provided that these subordination arrangements have been provided to the judicial administrator within 10 days of receipt of the notice sent by the judicial administrator or the publication of such notice inviting the affected parties to notify the existence of such arrangements) and (iii) equity holders are grouped in one or several classes. The judicial administrator can also create ""ad hoc"" classes, for example for public creditors or strategic suppliers. At least 21 days prior to the date of the vote on the draft restructuring plan, the judicial administrator shall notify each affected party of the methods of class allocation and computation of voting rights corresponding to the affected claims or rights enabling them to cast a vote. The amount of the claims taken into account for the computation of the voting rights is the one indicated by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditor or certified public accountant. The methods used are also notified to the court-appointed creditor's representative. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be brought before the insolvency judge at the request of the affected party, the debtor, the public prosecutor, the court-appointed creditor's representative or the judicial administrator. ----- The restructuring plan will be adopted once each class has voted on it by a two-third majority of the votes cast. The affected parties must vote within 20 to 30 days following receipt of the draft restructuring plan. This timeframe may be increased or decreased following a request by the debtor or the judicial administrator to the insolvency judge but cannot be less than 15 days. Within each class, the vote on the approval of the plan may be replaced by an agreement from the required majority. If the draft restructuring plan is approved by all classes under the required conditions and majority rules, the court will nevertheless have to make sure that certain conditions are met before approving the draft restructuring plan: - the restructuring plan has been approved in accordance with the rules governing the constitution of classes of affected parties; - creditors of the same class sharing sufficient common interests benefit from an equal treatment and are treated in proportion to their claims or rights; - the restructuring plan has been duly notified to all affected parties; - in the presence of dissenting creditors, the restructuring plan does not put those dissenting creditor in a less favorable position than the position they would have been in (i) if the order of priority of the distribution of asset sale proceeds in judicial liquidation proceedings, or the sale price of the business as a going concern via an asset sale plan (plan de cession) pursuant to Article L. 642-1 of the French Commercial Code were to apply or (ii) in the event of a better alternative solution if the restructuring plan were not to be approved; - to the extent applicable any new financing provided for in the restructuring plan is necessary for its implementation and does not unduly affect (ne porte pas une atteinte excessive aux) the interests of the affected parties. Even if these criteria are met, the court may refuse to approve a restructuring plan which does not offer a reasonable prospect of avoiding the insolvency of the company (state of cessation des paiements) or ensures business continuity (viabilité de l'entreprise). The court must also ensure that the interests of all affected parties are sufficiently protected. When the restructuring plan is not approved by all classes of creditors but only by a majority of (or one of) them, it may nevertheless be adopted by the court upon request made by the debtor or the judicial administrator with the consent of the debtor and imposed on the dissenting classes by means of a ""crossclass cram down"" (application forcée interclasses), provided that the plan meets the above mentioned conditions along with several additional conditions, including that: - the restructuring plan has been approved in accordance with the rules governing the approval of plans; - at least one of the following two criteria is met: - a majority of the classes of affected parties voted in favor of the plan, provided that at least one of those classes is a secured creditors' class or is senior to the ordinary unsecured creditors' class (créanciers chirographaires); - or, if the above criteria cannot be satisfied, at least one of the classes of affected parties, other than an equity holders' class or any other class which, after determining the value of the debtor as a going concern, could reasonably be expected not to be entitled to any payment or retain any interest in the context of a judicial liquidation or an asset sale plan (plan de cession), has voted favorably; - affected creditors of a dissenting class are fully repaid by the same or equivalent means where, under the plan, a lower ranking class is entitled to a payment or retains an interest (intéressement) under the restructuring plan (the ""absolute priority"" rule); ----- - no class of affected creditors may receive or maintain more than the total amount of its claims and interests; - when one or more classes of equity holders have been constituted and have not approved the restructuring plan: - the debtor (x) either employs at least 250 employees and has a net turnover of at least €20 million or (y) has a net turnover of €40 million (such thresholds applying to companies that own or control another company, within the meaning of Articles L. 2331 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, provided that all the companies together reach the aforementioned thresholds); - based on the value of the debtor as a going concern, one may reasonably assume that the equity holders of one or several dissenting classes would not be entitled to any payment or retain any interest in the context of a judicial liquidation or an asset sale plan (plan de _cession);_ - the shares issued, if the plan provides for a capital increase subscribed by cash contribution (which should include a subscription by way of set off), are offered in priority to the shareholders, pro rata their existing shareholding; and - the plan does not provide for the transfer of all or part of the rights of dissenting class or classes of equity holders. The court may depart from the ""absolute priority"" rule, with the agreement of the debtor, where such derogations are necessary in order to achieve the objectives of the plan and if the plan does not unduly prejudice (ne porte pas une atteinte excessive aux) the rights or interests of the affected parties. In particular, suppliers essential to the debtor's business, equity holders or holders of claims arising from the debtor's tort liability are eligible for special treatment. The court decision will constitute approval of the changes to the shareholding or to the rights of the equity holders or to the constitutional documents provided for in the restructuring plan. The court may designate a judicial mandataire to register in the debtor's books the changes to the share capital and to carry out all acts necessary for the implementation of such amendments.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

When the accounts show that the nature of the indebtedness makes it likely that a plan will be adopted only by creditors having the status of finance companies, credit institutions and the like, as well as by all holders of claims acquired from them or from a supplier of goods or services and, if applicable, bondholders, the debtor may request the opening of an accelerated safeguard proceeding, the effects of which shall be limited to these creditors. ----- If the debtor does not meet the conditions that require affected parties' classes (classes de parties affectées) (see above) to be constituted, the court shall authorize such constitution in the opening decision and the class-based consultation shall apply (see ""Safeguard Proceedings""). To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions: - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applies for commencement of conciliation proceedings; - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the proceedings; - its accounts are certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public accountant; - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not in a position to overcome; and - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern which is likely to be supported by enough of its affected parties (parties _affectées) so as to make the approval of the plan probable during the proceedings._ If a plan is not approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court will terminate the proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (or for conciliation proceedings, as discussed above) within 45 days of becoming insolvent; de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability. Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the safeguard proceedings observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors' representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the public prosecutor, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings or liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor was already insolvent at the time of the court decision opening the proceedings. In all cases, the court's decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors' representative, the public prosecutor and the workers' representatives (if any). As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. Judicial Reorganization The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order. An administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and make proposals for the reorganization of the debtor (by assisting the debtor in the preparation of a draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan or organizing the sale of the business by way of an asset sale plan (plan de cession)). At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the ----- court- appointed administrator, the creditors' representative (mandataire judiciaire), the public prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the partial cessation of the business (cessation partielle de l'activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d'assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d'administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities, including the following: - the plan is prepared and presented by the judicial administrator (with the assistance of the company as regards its preparation); - in case of a class-based consultation: - any affected party may prepare an alternative plan which shall be reported on by the judicial administrator and presented to the vote simultaneously with the plan prepared by the company provided that such alternative plan has been provided to the debtor and the judicial administrator at least 15 days before the date of the vote on the draft plan presented by the company; - if the plan is not approved by all classes any affected party may request from the court that it approves the plan by way of a cross class cram-down; and - if the court does not approve the plan, a new plan must be prepared and standard consultation shall apply (including the court-imposed rescheduling described in ""Safeguard Proceedings""). In judicial reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders' meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders' equity (capitaux propres) to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital (capital _social) as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the administrator may request from_ the court the appointment of a trustee (mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders' meeting and to vote on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan. In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls one or more companies having together at least 150 employees (within the meaning of the French Labor Code), (ii) the disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment and (iii) the modification of the company's share capital seems to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the judicial administrator or of the State prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least three months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders' meetings required to approve the modification of the company's share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either: - appoint a trustee (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders' meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or indirectly, a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company's shareholders' meetings; any consent clause being deemed unwritten, the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees. In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings. ----- In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan. Judicial Liquidation If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the former creditors' representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified judicial liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly to liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors' priority order of payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management. Disposal of the debtor's assets will take place as follows: - a sale of business (cession d'entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and organize such sale of the business as a going concern via an asset sale (i.e., an asset sale plan (plan de cession)), any third party (as construed under French law) being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor's business); or - a piecemeal sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to: - launch auction sales (vente aux enchères and adjudication amiable for real estate assets only); - sell by private sale (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received (the formal authorization of the insolvency judge being necessary to enter into the sale agreement with the bidder); or - in practice, request, under the supervision of the insolvency judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement such process is questioned by certain legal authors and case law in this respect has varied. If the court adopts a reorganization or sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain and the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif) or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to an insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d'actif). The court may also terminate the proceedings: - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; or - in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a _mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received_ from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

During the observation period, the court-appointed administrator investigates the business of the company. Under safeguard proceedings, the court-appointed administrator's mission is limited to either supervising the debtor's management or assisting it, and in any case helping it prepare a safeguard plan for the company. In judicial reorganization proceedings, the court-appointed administrator's mission is usually to assist the management and to make proposals for the reorganization of the company, which proposals may include a reorganization or an asset sale plan. In judicial reorganization proceedings, the court may also decide that the court-appointed administrator will manage the company alone by replacing the debtor's management. At the end of the observation period, if it concludes that the company can survive as a going concern, the court will adopt a safeguard or a reorganization plan, which will essentially provide for a restructuring and/or rescheduling of debts which may only entail the partial divesture of assets rather than the entire business, to a third party (a sale of the entire business is not possible under safeguard proceedings). At the end of the observation period of judicial reorganization proceedings and, alternatively to a reorganization plan, the court may determine that all or part of the business should be sold to purchasers who have submitted bids. In such a case, the court orders such a (partial or entire) sale in the framework of a so-called ""asset sale plan"" (plan de cession), which consists of transferring assets, contracts and employees cherrypicked by the purchaser thereto, for a lump sum, in accordance with the bid submitted by the purchaser during the observation period. Judicial liquidation proceedings entail the relief of the debtor's management and there is no observation period in such proceedings. The outcome of liquidation proceedings, which is decided by the court without a vote of the creditors, may be a sale of the business and/or isolated sales of the debtor's assets in order to discharge the debtor's liabilities. Where a sale of the business (partial or not) is contemplated, the court may authorize a temporary continuation of the business for a maximum period of three months (renewable once for a period of three months at the public prosecutor's request) whose effects are similar to an observation period. The sales that have been pre-packed in mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings and that are deemed satisfactory will be implemented in the framework of subsequent court-administered proceedings through an expeditious process. Such sale could only relate to part (but not all) of the business of the debtor in safeguard proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the ""hardening period"" (période _suspecte), being the period from the insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the_ judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings affecting it. Certain transactions entered into by the debtor during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the court. Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed those of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of the debts that are due made in a manner which is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with Article 2350 of the ----- French Civil Code, any security interest agreement or right of retention agreement granted on the debtor's assets or rights for debts previously contracted unless they replace a previous security with at least an equivalent nature and basis and with the exception of the assignments of receivables provided under Article L. 313-23 of the French Monetary and Financial Code made in execution of a framework agreement entered into prior to the date of insolvency, any legal mortgage (hypothèque légale) resulting from a judgment against the debtor for debts previously incurred, provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures _conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to_ stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarised declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d'insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code. Voidable transactions include, transactions for consideration, payments made on debts that are due, notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions, in each case, if such actions are taken after the debtor was in _cessation des paiements_ and the court determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. In addition, transactions relating to transfers of assets for no consideration and notarised declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d'insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period.

Nor are ""contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings"" (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation) dated January 14, 2014, n° 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) that it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. This possibility is excluded in the case of an accelerated safeguard. Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its post-commencement contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor's obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of an asset sale plan (plan de cession) as described above; in such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the asset sale plan (plan de cession), as described above, or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends. During the observation period (and some of these rules continue to apply during the execution of the approved plan): ----- - accrual of interest is suspended (except in respect of loans having a maturity of at least one year, or of contracts providing for a payment which is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded); - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by the insolvency judge (juge-commissaire) to recover assets required by the continued operation of the business and post-petition debts, unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor; - debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a ""New Money Lien""), provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the court-appointed administrator or, failing one, the mandataire judiciaire or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the commissioner of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l'exécution du plan) or the judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period; - in the context of judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en cours) will be required; - creditors may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or against a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings if the objective of such legal action is: - to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due) in order to file a proof of claim, as described below) - to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed to the creditor; or - to enforce the creditor's rights against any assets of the debtor, except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution _judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset—whether tangible or intangible,_ moveable or immoveable, is located in another Member State within the European Union, in which case the rights _in rem_ of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation; and - any increase in the scope of a contractual security or a contractual right of retention, by any means whatsoever, by the inclusion of goods or rights, or by transfer of the debtor's assets or rights, is prohibited. Any contrary provision, in particular relating to a transfer of property or rights of the debtor which have not yet arisen on the date of decision commencing the proceedings, is unenforceable as from the date of the court decision opening the relevant proceedings. However, the increase in the scope may validly result from an assignment of a claim under Article L. 313-23 of the French Monetary and Financial Code when it is made pursuant to a master assignment agreement entered into prior to the opening of the proceedings, or from an express derogation from this prohibition provided for in the French Monetary and Financial Code or the French Insurance Code. A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan and of a judicial reorganization plan adopted by the court. In accelerated safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope of those proceedings. Debts owed to other creditors continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business. ----- As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of courtadministered proceedings must file a proof of claim (déclaration de créances) with the creditors' representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in the _Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales_ (by exception, the deadline starts upon receipt of an individual notification for those creditors whose claim arose out of a published contract or who benefit from a published security interest); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. Where the debtor has informed the creditors' representative of the existence of a claim and no proof of a claim has been filed yet, such claim is deemed filed with the creditors' representative. Creditors are allowed to confirm a proof of claim made on their behalf. Creditors who have not submitted their claims during the relevant period, whose claims are not deemed filed with the creditors' representative save for a ratification by the creditor of a proof of claim made on its behalf, are barred, except with respect to very limited exceptions, from receiving distributions made in accordance with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferential creditors under French law. Under accelerated safeguard proceedings the claims held by parties affected (parties affectées) that took part in the conciliation proceedings are listed by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditor (or, in its absence, its accountant) and are thus deemed to have been filed. This list should include among other information, the subordination agreements brought to the debtor's attention by the creditors before the opening of the proceeding. Although such affected parties (parties affectées) can file proofs of claim pursuant to the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust the amounts of their claims as set forth on the list prepared by the debtor (within the 2 or 4 month time limit). Those affected parties (parties affectées) who did not take part in the conciliation proceedings would have to file their proofs of claim within the above-mentioned deadlines. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, an accelerated safeguard plan or a reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. If the court adopts an asset sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of the creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator in charge of selling the assets of the company and settling the relevant debts in accordance with their ranking. French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employee claims, post-commencement legal costs (essentially court-officials fees), creditors who benefit from a New Money Lien or a Post Commencement Lien (see above) and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to creditors who benefit from a Post Commencement Lien. This order of priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention right over certain assets with respect to their claim related to such asset.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court. Case law has recently set out that this liability would also require that the granting of the facility be deemed wrongful. If a creditor has repeatedly interfered in the company's management, it can be deemed a de facto manager of such company (dirigeant de fait). In such case, Article L.651-2 of the French Commercial Code provides that, if liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) have been commenced against the debtor, the creditor may be liable for bearing the excess of liabilities over the company's assets, along with the other managers (whether de jure or de facto), as the case may be, if it is established that their mismanagement contributed to the company's shortfall of assets. If such conditions are met, French courts will decide whether the managers should bear all or part of the shortfall amount. ----- However, a manager (whether de jure or de facto) cannot be held liable on the basis of Article L. 651-2 of the French Commercial Code in cases of ""simple negligence"" (simple négligence) in the management of the company.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such person guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such debtor's or a third party's obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged, in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant person, by the creditors' representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l'exécution du plan) insolvency proceedings of the relevant person, or, in or outside insolvency proceedings, by any of the creditors of the relevant person who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act.

As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes or the guarantees thereof and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes or the guarantees thereof could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees.

These limitations and defenses may include those that relate to certain exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations which would constitute prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Code de Commerce, capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules, fiduciary duties and civil or criminal liabilities of the directors of such French Guarantor (including infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French _Code de Commerce) and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. In addition, the_ Note Guarantees of the French Guarantors will also be limited so that the granting of such Note Guarantee would not be against the relevant French Guarantor's corporate benefit. Existence of corporate benefit is a factual matter which must be determined on a case-by-case basis, and we cannot be certain as to the standard a French court would use to determine the French Guarantor's corporate benefit, any limit on the applicable Guarantee or whether such Note Guarantee would be deemed void. Under French financial assistance rules, a company incorporated as a _société anonyme or a_ _société par _actions simplifiée is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly_ or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition. Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could subordinate or declare any guarantee or security unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee or security, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor or security provider, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a real and adequate corporate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. Accordingly, the Note Guarantees of the French Guarantors will contain language limiting the debt guaranteed to an amount that will not violate applicable French law restrictions. In particular, the aggregate obligations and liabilities under the Guarantee of each French Guarantor issued on the Issue Date will be limited to the portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, if any, that are lent (directly or indirectly) to such French Guarantor, or to subsidiaries of such French Guarantor under intercompany loans or similar arrangements or used to refinance any indebtedness previously on-lent directly or indirectly to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries, and to the extent such on-loans or similar arrangements remain outstanding at the time of a demand is made under such Note Guarantees. In case the proceeds of the Notes are used to refinance (directly or indirectly) any indebtedness previously on lent directly or indirectly to a French Guarantor or its controlled subsidiaries through the intercompany loans, such intercompany loans would be maintained (and their termination date would be extended) due to the incurrence by such French Guarantor of obligations and liabilities under its Guarantee. It is specified that any payment made by any such French Guarantor under its Guarantee shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due by such French Guarantor under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above and any repayment of the intercompany loans by such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries shall reduce pro tanto the amount payable by the French Guarantor under its Guarantee. Any amount that is lent to any French Guarantor will vary over time depending on the needs of the French Guarantor, and there can be no assurance as to the amount that will have actually been lent and not repaid by a French Guarantor as of any date on which the related Guarantee may be called upon. In light of the foregoing, a French Guarantor's liability under its Guarantee (as the same is limited in accordance with the above description) could be materially reduced or eliminated. Accordingly, certain of the French Guarantors (in particular those to which no proceeds of the Notes are on-lent) are unlikely to have significant liability under their guarantees of the Notes, and may have no liability, in the event the guarantees are called upon. ----- It is also possible that a French Guarantor, or a creditor of a French Guarantor, or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a bankruptcy of a French Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the French Guarantor's Guarantee on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that such Note Guarantee should be limited or voided. In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm's-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm's length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances. _Limitations on enforcement of security interests and cash amount (soulte)_ Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due and unpaid to it. Under French law, pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) before a court, (a) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (b) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or (ii) to the extent provided for in the relevant security document and not otherwise prohibited by law, contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed or appointed by a judge expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. In proceedings regarding an attribution judiciaire or a pacte commissoire, an expert is appointed to value the Collateral (in this case, the pledged assets) (such valuation being made by reference to the date of enforcement) and if the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured liabilities under the pledge, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured liabilities under the pledge. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral. On the contrary, if the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured liabilities under the pledge, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect. An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through such public auction procedures, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies. If the Security Agent enforces the Collateral pursuant to option (ii) described above, there is a risk that the secured creditors may not be able to re-sell the Collateral for its full value as determined by the expert, yet may still be required to pay the pledgor, upon the Security Agent having become the owner of the Collateral, the difference between the value of the Collateral and the amount of the secured debt if the Collateral is determined by the expert to have a greater value than the amount of secured debt. In addition, enforcement of the Note Guarantees may be subject to constraints in relation to the ownership of companies operating clinical laboratories, such as French restrictions aiming at preventing conflicts of interest, or rules restricting the concentration of the supply of clinical laboratory services, as provided under the French Public Health Code. Further, in view of the area of activity of the Group or certain members of the Group, it should be noted that foreign investments in French companies or businesses which operate in certain ""sensitive"" sectors under the French Monetary and Financial Code (where their activities relate to equipment, products or services which are critical to the interests of France in terms of public order, public safety or national security, including but not limited to public health) may require the prior authorization of the French authorities. This requirement may interfere with the enforcement of the Collateral consisting of shares or a business. ----- Where the French company is involved in a sensitive sector, the following shall constitute foreign investments which are subject to the prior authorization procedure: - A transaction as a result of which a non-French entity or a French entity under the control of a non-French entity) (i) acquires the control (within the meaning of Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) or (ii) acquires all or part of a standalone business activity (branche d'activité), in each case of an entity governed by French law. It is anticipated the French foreign investment control regime will be amended by end of 2023 to not only cover investments in legal entities governed by French law, but also investments in French branches of foreign companies. - A transaction as a result of which a non-EU/EEA investor (or a French/EU/EEA entity under the control of a non-EU/EEA entity) crosses, directly or indirectly, the threshold of 25% of the voting rights of a non-listed French entity or of 10% of the voting rights of a French company which shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market in France, the European Union, or in an EEA State (the 10% restriction currently applies until December 31, 2023, but is expected to become a permanent restriction). This type of foreign investment in France (i.e., the crossing of the 10/25% threshold) therefore is not applicable to an individual who is a national of an EU Member State or of an EEA State that has entered into a mutual administrative assistance agreement with France for the purpose of combating tax evasion and tax avoidance, and who is domiciled in one of these States, or to an entity in which all the members of the chain of control are governed by the law of one of these States or are nationals of and domiciled in one of these States. Each foreign entity or person in the investor's chain of control will be considered a foreign investor.A French investor under non-French control, or a French ultimate investor with a foreign investor within its chain of control may therefore be subject to the French foreign direct investment control regime. When a foreign investment is subject to the authorization of the French authorities as above, the transaction cannot be completed prior to authorization. The foreign investor must submit a formal application for prior authorization to the French authorities, which shall render a decision within a period of 30 business days of receipt of the complete application, followed by a second 45 business days period if further examination is deemed necessary. In the absence of answer at the end of the relevant period, the authorization request will be deemed implicitly rejected. The French authorities may grant such prior authorization with or without specific commitments imposed on the foreign investor. We can provide no assurance that the approval of the French authorities would not be required in order to allow the enforcement of the Collateral consisting of shares or a business or that such approval, where required, would be granted. _Parallel Debt_ Under French law, certain ""accessory"" security interests such as pledges require that the pledgee and the creditor be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held by third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent under Article 2488-6 et seq. of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des sûretés) under Articles 2488-6 et. seq. of the French Civil Code (as modified by Ordinance n°2017-748 of May 4, 2017, which came into force on October 1, 2017). In our case, the beneficial holders of interest in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. Instead, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a ""parallel debt"" in favor of the Security Agent directly. Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the parallel debt,and will not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent. Although the enforceability in France of certain rights (the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a parallel debt was recognized for the first time by the French Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation) on September 13, 2011 (Cass. Com. 13 September 2011 n° 10-25.533 Belvédère), there is no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, this decision was relating to a bond documentation governed by the laws of the state of New York. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filling of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. This decision cannot be considered as a general recognition of enforceability in France of the right of a security agent benefiting from a parallel debt obligation and no ----- assurance can be given that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. In particular, the French Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation) upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy _(ordre public _international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double_ payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt mechanism. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as creditor of the Parallel Debt under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to rely on the Parallel Debt construction to receive on the basis of such construction any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, under a parallel debt construction, the holders of the Notes bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important following Defaults or Events of Default,and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the Notes. The concept of ""trust"" has been recognized for tax purposes by Article 792 bis of the French Code général _des impôts and the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published_ decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011, n°10-25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while certain comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985, on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, and two _réponses ministérielles_ dated January 24, 2008, and January 8, 2009, indicated its reluctance to do so to avoid conflicts between the ""trust"" and the French fiducie, so that the concept of ""trust"" has not been generally recognized under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created for the benefit of the Trustee are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Trustee. _Recognition of Intercreditor Arrangements by French Courts_ There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme Court (Cour _de cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the Intercreditor_ Agreement, except for Article L. 626-30 of the French Commercial Code which states that the judicial administrator shall ensure that the determination of classes of affected parties complies with the subordination arrangements entered into before the opening of the relevant proceedings (provided that these subordination arrangements have been provided to the judicial administrator within 10 days of receipt of the notice sent by the judicial administrator or the publication of such notice inviting the affected parties to notify the existence of such arrangements). As a consequence, except to the extent referred to above, we cannot rule out that a French court would not give effect to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. _Lower Ranking Security in France_ The Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents provide for a mechanism allowing the implementation of second or lower ranking pledges. Although there is no express prohibition under French law on granting a lower-ranking pledge over a securities account in which the shares or other securities of a French company are registered, some legal commentators have queried whether a lower-ranking pledge is legally permissible to the extent that a pledge of a securities account is deemed, under French law, to confer a retention right (droit de rétention) over the securities credited on the securities account, thereby preventing such grantor from granting a further lowerranking pledge thereon. Consequently, no assurance can be given that a court would concur with the view that a lower ranking pledge over securities account is valid. Therefore, there is a risk that the second or lower ranking pledge over the securities account in which the shares of such company are respectively registered may be held void or unenforceable by a French court, which in turn could materially adversely affect the recovery under the Notes or Note Guarantees (as applicable) following an enforcement event. ----- A pledge over the shares of a stock company (société par actions) governed by French law is a pledge over the relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the shares of such company are registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres financiers). As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of a pledge over a securities account in which the shares of such a company are registered. Moreover, in France, as mentioned above, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over receivables/bank accounts. As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of the pledges over the receivables/bank accounts of a company. Although French law does not expressly prohibit the grantor of a pledge over receivables/bank accounts from granting a second ranking pledge or lower ranking pledge over the same receivables/bank accounts, this structure has not been tested before the French courts and no assurances can be given that such second ranking pledges or lower ranking pledges would be upheld if tested.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

According to the current wording of the applicable emergency law, a forecast period of four months applies until December 31, 2023 for the review of the going concern forecast within examination of over-indebtedness. However, according to the accompanying explanatory reasoning of the German legislation, it must be taken into account that the energy crisis regulation may lose some of its practical effectiveness even before December 31, 2023: If it is clear for a company less than four months before December 31, 2023 that it will be over-indebted immediately after ----- December 31, 2023 under the over-indebtedness concept of section 19 InsO (with a forecast period of 12 months), this finding may also be relevant for the going concern forecast to be prepared under the emergency law. The predominant advisory practice and prevailing view in legal literature, therefore, assumes that from September 1, 2023, a forecast period of 12 months must be applied as a basis for the examination of going concern within the analysis of over-indebtedness under German insolvency law. - **_Financial plan to be delivered under debtor-in-possession insolvency proceedings and the",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully voided by the insolvency administrator or custodian, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator's or custodian's right to void transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to any German Guarantor based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the noteholders as well as the granting of collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes, if any, could be subject to potential challenges (i.e., claw back rights) by an insolvency administrator or custodian under the rules of avoidance as set out in the German Insolvency Code. In case the validity or enforceability of the Notes is avoided successfully, you may not be able to recover any amounts under the Notes. If payments have already been made under any Note, the insolvency administrator or custodian may require that the recipients return the payment to the insolvency estate and you would instead then only have a general unsecured claim without preference in insolvency proceedings. In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be voided according to the German Insolvency Code in the following cases: - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that clearly suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor's illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that clearly suggest such illiquidity or filing); - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the ----- opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had acknowledge of circumstances that clearly suggest such detrimental effect); - a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew either of the debtor's illiquidity or of such filing at the time of the transaction; - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security for a third party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention of prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the other party knew of such intention at the time of such act. In case the act in question granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the hardening period is reduced to four years. If the creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction, it must have known of the illiquidity (and not only an impeding illiquidity) of the debtor for its knowledge of the debtor's intention to prejudice its creditors to be presumed. A creditor that agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments is presumed to not have had knowledge of the illiquidity of the debtor. If the act fulfils the requirements of the cash-consideration-privilege, the act will only be voidable if the other party knew that the debtor was acting dishonestly; - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party that directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor's intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term ""affiliated party"" includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor's share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; - any act that provides security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a shareholder loan made to the debtor or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; ##### • any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor or surety (Garant oder Bürge) (in which case the shareholder must compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, ""knowledge"" is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge ----- of the debtor's intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor's actual or imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor's creditors, provided that, if the relevant act by the debtor consisted of a settlement of an obligation or the grant of a security which was due to be paid or granted, as the case may be, then the knowledge of the debtor's intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors is only presumed if the other party was aware of the actual illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the debtor and of the fact that the transaction prejudiced the debtor's creditors. With respect to an ""affiliated party,"" there is a general statutory presumption that such party had ""knowledge."" The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a ""cash transaction"" and may as such be privileged – under certain circumstances – under the German Insolvency Code (Bargeschäftsprivileg) by not being subject to certain avoidance rights. In addition, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right according to the German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the voidable periods are calculated from the date a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Consequently, any insolvency proceedings with regard to the German Guarantors are likely to be initiated in Germany if the German Guarantor was held to have its ""centre of main interests"" (as such term is described in Article 3 (1) of the Regulation (EU) No. 848/2015 of 20 May 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings) within the territory of Germany at the time the application for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed and German insolvency law would most likely govern such proceedings. The following German insolvency considerations will also apply to other entities (including the Issuer) if they are considered to have their ""centre of main interests"" in Germany. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors' claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. ----- The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany. Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. The German Insolvency Code does however provide for certain mechanisms designed to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity insolvency proceedings; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors' committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for ""coordination proceedings"" (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a ""coordination insolvency administrator"" (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a ""coordination plan"" (Koordinationsplan). Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of overindebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor (i.e., where its liabilities exceed the value of its assets) unless the debtor's business is predominantly likely to continue as a going concern (positive _Fortführungsprognose) or in the event that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due_ (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless it is virtually certain that the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be deemed acceptable to the creditor to further await the payments owed by such debtor. In addition, the debtor can file for insolvency proceedings if it is imminently at risk of being unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit). If a legal entity (juristische Person) becomes illiquid and/or over-indebted, the_ management of such legal entity and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders, are obligated to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, or at the latest within three weeks or six weeks respectively after the mandatory insolvency reason, (i.e., illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness) has occurred. Noncompliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. In addition, the debtor can file for insolvency proceedings if it is imminently at risk to be unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit). However, in that case, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings. If the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate such process based on debtor-in-possession status and can prove that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile, the court may grant a period of up to three months to prepare an insolvency plan for the debtor business (Schutzschirm). During the debtor-in-possession proceedings it also has to be ensured that the debtor is willing and able to adapt its management to the interests of the creditors. Therefore, German insolvency law requires debtorin-possession planning as a filing condition. The debtor-in-possession plan consists of the following components: - a financial plan for the period of six months, confirming that the costs of the proceedings will be covered in addition to the costs of continuing business operations. The plan must also set out the sources of financing; - a concept for the implementation of the debtor-in-possession proceedings, in which in particular the extent and causes of the crisis are analyzed and necessary measures for overcoming it are determined; - a report on the status of negotiations with creditors, shareholders and third parties; - a description of the precautions taken by the debtor to fulfil its obligations under insolvency law; ----- ##### • a substantiated description of the additional or reduced costs of debtor-in-possession proceedings compared to regular insolvency proceedings. (Prognostic) advisor and court costs must also be taken into account; The depth of the presentation and the degree of detail are to be determined in each individual case and depend on the size and the specific circumstances of the debtor. During the three months period (Schutzschirm) described above, the creditors' rights to enforce security may – upon application of the filing debtor – be suspended. Under these circumstances, the insolvency court must appoint a custodian (Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or impartial). The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures (vorläufige Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor's assets during these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the court will also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger _Insolvenzverwalter) unless the debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) –_ an insolvency process in which the debtor's management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor's business affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter) – and this petition is not obviously futile. Depending on the size of the debtor's business operations, the insolvency court must, or may appoint a preliminary creditors' committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) to, form a view on the profile of the officeholder to be appointed or to suggest a particular individual be appointed by the court. If the members of the preliminary creditors' committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible (i.e., incompetent and/or not impartial)). To ensure that the preliminary creditors' committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it shall comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large creditors and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor's assets (which includes the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor's net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes _Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, particularly if there are sufficient assets to cover at_ least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors) advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (usually the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court unless debtor-inpossession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) are ordered. In the absence of debtor-in-possession proceedings, the right to administer the debtor's business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator upon the occasion of the first creditors' meeting (erste _Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by head count_ and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual becoming the insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual is eligible as officeholder (i.e., he or she is sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial). The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor's business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim). From the perspective of the holders of the Notes, among others, some important consequences of such opening of formal insolvency proceedings against any German Guarantor who may be subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following: ----- - the right to administer and dispose of the assets of any German Guarantor would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate, unless debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) are ordered; ##### • if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to any German Guarantor, disposals effected by the management of any German Guarantor, after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of law; ##### • if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of any German Guarantor's property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; - claims against any German Guarantor may only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and ##### • any person that has a right for segregation (Aussonderung) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for segregation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any movable assets in his, her or the debtor's possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) has decided that the secured creditor is entitled to initiate enforcement of preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) with respect to IP pledges (and general view of legal literature is that this shall also be the case for pledges over shares or company interests) forming part of the insolvency estate. If the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realising the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any), are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims (Insolvenzforderungen)), particularly claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvent estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full. Therefore, the proceeds resulting from the realization of the insolvency estate of the debtor may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors of any German Guarantor in full after secured creditors (if any) have been satisfied. The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator must, however, compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use. ----- Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of funds or the payment of a consideration), while claims of a person who become a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings (Massegläubiger) generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Under certain circumstances, restrictive covenants and undertakings in finance documents may result in the relevant creditor being considered to hold a ""shareholder-like position"" (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung) in the relevant debtor, guarantor or grantor of security. In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of such debtor, guarantor or grantor of security, the claims against such debtor, guarantor or grantor of security would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen) in accordance with the rules applying to shareholder loans. A third party acquiring the claims that are subject to the rules of the treatment of shareholder loans (section 135 of the German Insolvency Code) will itself be exposed to a claw-back risk with respect to repayments that have been made within the period of one year. Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in insolvency proceedings over the assets of the debtor (or in any transaction security) unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. To the extent any creditor that benefited from the transaction security was a subordinated creditor, potential sharing and equalisation provisions in the finance documents could result in holders who are not subordinated suffering a shortfall on the amount they recover. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other unsubordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the debtor on the date the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given herein, and in proportion to their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offense binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims on the debtor's gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for the restitution of shareholder loans (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan. While in ordinary insolvency proceedings the value of any German Guarantor's assets will be realised by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of any German Guarantor's business as a going concern, a different approach aimed at the rehabilitation of any German Guarantor can be taken based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court (while a group of dissenting creditors or the debtor can – under certain circumstances – be crammed down). The shares in the debtor can also be included in the insolvency plan (e.g., they can be transferred to third parties, including a transfer to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap). Under certain conditions, such provisions could be adopted against the votes of the affected holders of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

KG""). In addition, the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz) (the ""AktG"") provides for significant limitations for Guarantees if that Guarantor is incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—a ""AG"") or a German limited partnership with an AG as its general partner (an ""AG & Co. KG""). This also applies to all Subsidiaries of an AG (i.e., all Subsidiaries of the Target). As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (""Sections 30 and 31"") prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH's net assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) — or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner's net assets — is or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital). The granting or guarantees and/or security interests by a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant guarantees or security interests and to provide security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31 and to limit any potential personal liability of management, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, indentures, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called ""limitation language"" in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such ""limitation language,"" the beneficiaries of the guarantees or security interests contractually agree to enforce the guarantees and security interests against the German subsidiary which is a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG only if and to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the subsidiary's — or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, in the general partner's — net assets falling below, or increasing an existing shortfall of, its stated share capital. Section 57 paragraphs 1 and 3 AktG generally prohibits the granting of distributions and other benefits (including guarantees and securities in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company) by an AG to its shareholders, with the exception of the distribution of the balance sheet profit (Bilanzgewinn). Obligations under transactions entered into in violation of this prohibition (e.g., granting of guarantees or security) must not be performed by the relevant company and are therefore unenforceable. In addition section 71a AktG provides that the granting of guarantees or security by an AG which serve the purpose of supporting the acquisition of shares in such stock corporation is in principle prohibited. In case of a violation such guarantees and security would be void and unenforceable or subject to a redemption claim against the beneficiary. In order to ensure the validity and enforceability of guarantees and security granted by subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of an AG or an AG & Co. KG it is market practice for credit agreements, indentures, guarantees and security documents to contain a limitation language pursuant to which the guarantee or security is limited to comply with sections 57 AktG and 71a AktG. Accordingly, as a matter of German corporate law it is standard that the Indenture and security documents contain contractual ""limitation language"" to limit any Guarantees or Collateral, to the extent provided by a Guarantor and/or security grantor incorporated in Germany as a GmbH, GmbH & Co. KG, AG, or AG & Co. KG and their Subsidiaries. Pursuant to such limitation language the beneficiaries of any guarantee and/or security interests agree to enforce against a German Guarantor and/or security grantor which is a GmbH, GmbH & Co. KG, AG, or AG & Co. KG only to the extent that such enforcement does not lead to a violation of sections 57, 71 a AktG (in relation to an AG and an AG & Co. KG) or sections 30, 31 GmbHG (in relation to a GmbH and GmbH & Co. KG), respectively. In each case, this could lead to a situation in which the respective Guarantee or Collateral granted by such Guarantor or security provider cannot be enforced at all. German capital maintenance rules and financial assistance rules are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of German Guarantors constituted in the form of a GmbH, a GmbH & Co. KG, an AG or an AG & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the Issuer to make payment on the Notes or of the German Guarantors to make payments on the Guarantees or negatively affect the ability to enforce the Collateral. ----- In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called ""destructive interference"" (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a GmbH, GmbH & Co. KG, AG, or AG & Co. KG of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a Guarantee or any Collateral granted by a German Guarantor. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant Collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of Guarantees and/or Collateral by any of the German Guarantors. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of the Guarantee or Collateral could become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the Guarantee and/or Collateral was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Such accessory security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) (i) will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated, (ii) may not be assigned independently, but would automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned and (iii) may only be granted to the creditor of a claim to be secured by the accessory security interest. The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the security documents. The accessory security interests will only be granted to the Security Agent. The Security Agent is however not a creditor under the Notes. In order to allow the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit from the pledges under German law, such pledges will also secure a so-called ""parallel debt"" obligation created under the Intercreditor Agreement. Pursuant to such parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to the sum of any amounts payable by any obligors under, in particular, the Notes and the Indenture (the ""Parallel Debt Obligation""). The pledges governed by German law will directly and exclusively (to the extent the notes are concerned) secure the Parallel Debt Obligation, rather than secure the holders' claims under the Notes directly. The Parallel Debt Obligation is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the creditors under the Notes and the Guarantees (the ""Principal",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

An essential part of the law is the introduction of a new Act on a Stabilization and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises (""Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act""), which establishes a comprehensive legal framework for out-of-insolvency financial restructurings in Germany. Proceedings under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (""Restructuring Proceedings"") are initiated through a notification by the respective debtor to affected creditors or the competent restructuring court (Anzeige des Restrukturierungsvorhabens). A debtor can access the new restructuring tools of the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act upon the occurrence of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which occurs if it is more likely than not that the debtor will not be able to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over (generally) the next 24 months. The debtor may (but is not obliged to) alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the company is imminently illiquid (see above). Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act do not necessarily cover all of a debtor's liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of ----- the debtor's liabilities (with the exception of employees' claims, including pensions, and claims based on intentionally committed acts of tort), only certain types (for example, financial liabilities, including the Notes), or only selected liabilities. In addition and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools available under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be kept to a minimum. The tools available under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act may in the case of a group of companies only be used for each entity separately, however certain tools may be extended to cover security granted by entities that are connected entities (verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor. The core component of the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act is an out-of-insolvency restructuring of the debtor's liabilities via a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan), including, for example, by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest rates,maturities of liabilities or covenants. Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including, for example, a release of) collateral granted for the benefit of the Notes by the debtor as well as its subsidiaries and parent and sister companies. A restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved by the required majority or majorities of a debtors' creditors. The restructuring plan will be voted on in classes. The adoption of the restructuring plan requires, in principle, that in each class a majority of three-quarters of the voting rights approve the plan (whereas voting rights are determined by the amount of the claim, the value of the security and, in the case of share or membership rights, the share of the subscribed capital of the debtor). However, if more than one class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted and become binding on creditors if creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, provided certain requirements are met and the restructuring court confirms the restructuring plan (cross-class cramdown). The Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the debtor so as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools include a stabilization order by the restructuring court (which is granted upon the application by the debtor). Such stabilization order can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The stabilization order can initially be granted for a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the stabilization order up to a maximum of eight months subject to certain conditions being satisfied. For the Noteholders, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act by a German Guarantor would be the following: - the negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or only limited review or supervision by a court; - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a period of up to eight months due to a stabilization order; - any claims and rights of the Noteholder can be subject to and potentially be compromised by the restructuring plan (for example, in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal or interest or a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the ranking of the security right); - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to Restructuring Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any Noteholder without the consent of each Noteholder (generally, the relevant majority requirement is 75% of the respective principal amount) and, if the prerequisites for a cross-class cram-down are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the Noteholders. Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in any Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation upon such proceeding being included as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of that regulation. In any other case, the recognition of the restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the holders and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, the legal concept of creating parallel debt obligations has not yet been tested before a German court and there is no certainty that German courts will uphold such pledges. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that such concept will not be recognised by German courts or that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of invalidity and unenforceability of pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. Moreover, the Security Agent holds the pledges in trust. This means that in the case of an insolvency of the Security Agent, the insolvency administrator over the insolvency estate of the Security Agent may successfully claim that there is no right for separation (Aussonderungsrecht) of the holders with respect to the secured claims. As a consequence, the secured claims (including the parallel debt) and the accessory security rights would remain with the (then insolvent) Security Agent. ----- German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors). Under German mandatory law, the value of collateral transferred or assigned for security purposes must not be excessive. Due to German mandatory law, security grantors may have a right to claim the release of certain collateral in case of a subsequent over-collateralization (where the value of security interest granted significantly and not only temporarily exceeds the amount of the secured obligations), or security interest can even be deemed void in case of an initial excessive overcollateralization. A security transfer or assignment violating this rule either in itself or in combination with other security interests will be deemed void if the violation exists at the time the collateral is granted. If the ratio is exceeded later as a result of partial prepayment or of progressing repayment of the secured obligations, the security grantor is entitled to a corresponding ratable release of the collateral. There is no clear authority as to how the ratio has to be applied in the context of a financing involving several companies and to what extent accessory forms of collateral (e.g., share pledges) granted for the same obligations have to be taken into account. While the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) does the calculation on a case-by-case basis, legal authors estimate that an initial over-collateralization is given if the realization value of the security exceeds the aggregate amount of secured claims.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The English Guarantors are companies incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Therefore, as a matter of English insolvency law, insolvency proceedings by or against an English Guarantor could be commenced in England and would be governed by English insolvency laws. Furthermore, even though the Issuer is organized under the laws of Luxembourg, it is possible that it could be subject to English insolvency proceedings. Although the scope of the English courts' jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any company that (a) is incorporated in the United Kingdom; (b) is incorporated in a European Economic Area (""EEA"") State; or (c) is not incorporated in an EEA State but has its ""centre of main interests"" in a member state (other than Denmark). While this allows English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions. English insolvency law is different from and may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that the Issuer or a Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including (a) by the company or a creditor making an application to court for administration; (b) by the company or certain types of secured creditor filing documents with the court for administration; (c) by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company; or (d) by the shareholders of the company resolving to put the company into liquidation. A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into administration if it is, or is likely, to become unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes. Under the Insolvency Act 1986 (the ""UK Insolvency Act""), a company is insolvent if it is unable to pay its debts. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a ""cash flow"" basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due), if it is insolvent on a ""balance sheet"" basis (the value of the company's assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), if it fails to satisfy ----- a creditor's statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 or if it fails to satisfy in full a judgment debt (or similar court order). The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the Note Guarantees given by the English Guarantor (or any other Guarantor who may be subject to the jurisdiction of the English court in respect of the opening of insolvency proceedings in England and Wales) and the security interests granted in respect of the Notes. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the applicable Guarantees and/or security securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of the English Guarantor (or any other Guarantor who may be subject to the jurisdiction of the English court in respect of the opening of insolvency proceedings in England and Wales). _Fixed and Floating Charges_ Fixed charge security has a number of advantages over floating charge security, save as provided under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (the ""Financial Collateral Arrangements",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1852,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1852.10,"Regulations""): (a) an administrator appointed to the company which granted the floating charge can",1852.10.1,,"dispose of floating charge assets for cash or collect receivables charged by way of floating charge and use the proceeds and/or cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to operate the charging company's business while in administration) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed charge over assets, even if created after the date of a floating charge over the same assets, will rank prior to the floating charge over some charged assets; (c) general costs and expenses (including the officeholder's remuneration) properly incurred in a windingup or administration are payable out of floating charge assets to the extent the assets of the company available for creditors generally are otherwise insufficient to meet them (subject to certain restrictions for the costs of litigation) in priority to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of its business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge; (e) floating charge security is subject to certain challenges under English insolvency law (for further information, see ""—Avoidance of Floating _Charge""); and (f) floating charge security is subject to the claims of preferential creditors (such as_ occupational pension scheme contributions, salaries owed to employees (subject to a cap per employee) and holiday pay owed to employees) and collected taxes such as VAT and, where the floating charge is not a security financial collateral arrangement, to the claims of unsecured creditors in respect of a ring-fenced amount of the proceeds (for further information, see ""—Administration and Floating Charges""). Under English insolvency law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterize as floating charges any security interests expressed to be created by a security document as fixed charges where the chargee does not have the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor's ability to deal with the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof or does not exercise such control in practice as the description given to the charges in the relevant security document as fixed charges is not determinative. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. _Administration and Floating Charges_ The UK Insolvency Act enables an administrator to be appointed (either by filing documents with the court or following an application to court) in respect of any company (i) incorporated in England, Wales, Scotland or an EEA state; or (ii) (irrespective of its country of incorporation) with its ""centre of main interests"" in the United Kingdom or an EU member state (other than Denmark). In each case and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become ""unable to pay its debts"" and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge that has become enforceable, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. The purpose of an administration is composed of three parts that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company's creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were to enter into liquidation without first being in administration or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to ----- secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see ""—Priority of Claims on Insolvency"" below). An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the UK Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the realization of any property subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside for satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the prescribed part (see ""—Prescribed Part"" below). An administrator may also, with prior approval by the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided _that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator_ applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. During the administration, in general no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or continued against the debtor or its assets, or security or guarantee enforced over the company's property, except with leave of the court or the consent of the administrator (statutory moratorium). Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over that company's property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to security interests created or arising under a ""financial collateral agreement"" (generally, security/collateral in respect of cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements Regulations. If the Issuer or a Guarantor were to enter administration, it is likely that any security or guarantee granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration, without the leave of court or consent of the administrator. In addition, other than in limited circumstances, no administrative receiver can be appointed by a secured creditor in preference to an administrator, and any already appointed must resign if requested to do so by the administrator. Where the company is already in administration no other receiver may be appointed. In order for a security agent to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company, it must hold a floating charge granted by an English company that must constitute a ""qualifying floating charge"" for purposes of the UK Insolvency Act and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document predates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the UK Insolvency Act to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument that (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver. A security agent will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with any other security interests granted to that party, relates to the whole, or substantially the whole, of the property of the relevant English company, and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that it is a matter of fact whether the extent of the security granted relates to ""the whole or substantially the whole"" of the property of a company and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company's assets should be charged to satisfy this test. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to ""capital market arrangements"" (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50 million during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a ""capital markets investment"" (which is defined in the UK Insolvency Act, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge, including as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office. _Fixed Charge Receivership_ A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain floating charges) may be appointed over some or all of the assets secured by a fixed charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed charge or (in limited circumstances) pursuant to statute under the Law of Property Act 1925 (the ""Law of Property Act""), although it is standard market practice to augment the powers of any receiver appointed through the relevant security document. ----- If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A receivership is not a process pursuant to English insolvency laws as such and a fixed charge receivership can be run in parallel to a liquidation or an administration. However, an administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a ""financial collateral arrangement."" The primary duty of a fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor, although certain limited duties are also owed to the chargor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company's creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor). _Scheme of Arrangement_ Although not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 (the ""Companies",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1852,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1852.11,"Act"") the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise",1852.11.1,,"of a company's liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors). The English Guarantor may be able to propose a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities as would any other Guarantor _provided that there is ""sufficient connection"" with the United Kingdom (which can include English law documents). Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or refuse to sanction the scheme. In exercising its discretion to sanction a scheme of a foreign obligor, the court will need to be satisfied that the scheme of arrangement would have substantial effect in the jurisdictions in which the company has its main assets or operations, in the jurisdictions of any other obligors of the debt and under the governing law the affected debt documents (if not English law). This is typically achieved by providing expert evidence that the scheme of arrangement (or its effect) is likely to be recognized in such jurisdictions. Once sanctioned, the scheme of arrangement binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the scheme of arrangement, which shall be effective (in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court's order sanctioning the scheme of arrangement to the Registrar of Companies. Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings. See also below in relation to the restructuring plan. _Liquidation/Winding-up_ Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of the company are realized and distributed by the liquidator to creditors (and, if applicable, shareholders) in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the UK Insolvency Act. Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company is dissolved and removed from the register of companies. There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) members' voluntary liquidation or creditors' voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company's members. The difference between the two voluntary proceedings is the solvency of the company in question; in a members' voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as ----- to the company's solvency over the following twelve months whereas the primary ground for the creditors' voluntary liquidation of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the UK Insolvency Act). Note that while a creditors' voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors' voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies, the tests for establishing jurisdiction are slightly different. For a compulsory liquidation, all that is required is that there is ""sufficient connection"" with the relevant UK jurisdiction. This can involve assets or creditors in the United Kingdom or English law governed agreements. For a voluntary liquidation, either the ""centre of main interests"" must be in the United Kingdom or the ""centre of main interests"" must be in the European Union with an establishment (very broadly, a branch office) in the United Kingdom. The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary windingup. In a compulsory winding up, under Section 127 of the UK Insolvency Act any disposition of the relevant company's property made after the commencement of the winding up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a ""financial collateral arrangement"" under the Financial Collateral Arrangements Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding up petition. Once a winding up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No action or proceeding may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. In the context of a voluntary winding up, however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the UK Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up — it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay to prevent the continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of security. A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company's property (provided that in respect of the sale of any property that is secured by a fixed charge in favor of a creditor, if that sale is made without the secured creditor's consent, it will be made subject to that security, as the creditor's consent will be needed to release the security) and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions. At the end of the liquidation process the company will be dissolved. Under the UK Insolvency Act, with some exceptions, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company that may be detrimental to creditors. However, this power does not apply to a contract where all the obligations under which have been performed, nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities of any other person. If a contract is disclaimed, the contractual counterparty has a right to sue for damages in respect of the terminated contract. In addition, the power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to any financial collateral arrangement. _Company Voluntary Arrangements_ Pursuant to Part I of the UK Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement (""CVA"") to the company's shareholders and creditors which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reducing of the company's unsecured debts. Though it does not result in the insolvency of a company, a CVA is implemented under the supervision of an insolvency practitioner who will act as the nominee before the CVA proposals are approved, and as the supervisor afterwards. Provided _that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure, it will_ bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote in the decision procedure or who would have been entitled to vote if they had had notice of the decision procedure. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent. Shareholders of the ----- company will also be asked to vote on the CVA but whether or not they vote in favor, the CVA will be implemented if the requisite majority of creditors approve the proposal. _Priority of Claims on Insolvency_ One of the primary functions of liquidation (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the insolvent company and to distribute the proceeds from those assets to its creditors. Under English insolvency law, creditors are placed into different classes and, with the exceptions and adjustments noted below, the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company's property are applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. After a company goes into liquidation (and following notice that an administrator intends to make a distribution to creditors), contractual set-off arrangements are only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of ""mutual dealing"" as applied by the mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if amounts remain due to the company). Certain amounts are excluded from the account (such as any post liquidation or post administration interest), and there are certain mandatory rules for the conversion of foreign currency claims. The granting of security (amongst other things) over the relevant claims will destroy mutuality for these purposes. The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent the value of the secured assets covers that indebtedness) and creditors with a proprietary interest in the debtor's assets but only with respect to the assets in which they have a proprietary interest; - _Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - _Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (iv) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (the ""FSCS"") up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally; Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential debts and include (but are not limited to) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit, claims by HM Revenue and Customs in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax, employee NI contributions, student loan repayments and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers). As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally; - _Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; ----- - _Fifth ranking: firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors (save where such creditors are deferred under Section 74(2)(f) of the UK Insolvency Act) and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. These debts rank equally among themselves unless there are subordination agreements in place between any of them. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors or the secured creditor elects to surrender its security; _secondly, interest on the company's unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable_ contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration which had been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Note Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; _thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above_ and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid; and - _Sixth ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation. _Onset of Insolvency_ The date of the Onset of Insolvency (as discussed below), for the purposes of, among others, transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges (as discussed below) depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In an administration, the Onset of Insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation, the Onset of Insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes the relevant winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the Onset of Insolvency will be the same as for the initial administration. _Challenges to Guarantees and Security_ There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting of security and guarantees by any company that could be subject to English insolvency proceedings can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if an administrator or liquidator is appointed to the company within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) of the granting of the guarantee or security. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to the Issuer or any Guarantor, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by such company. The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to charges and guarantees: _Transactions at an Undervalue_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. It will only be a transaction at an undervalue if at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the English company is or becomes insolvent (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the company grants the security interest or the guarantee within a period of two years prior to the Onset of Insolvency. A transaction might be subject to being set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person, if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money's worth, than the consideration given by such company. A ----- court, however, generally will not intervene if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the company in such proceedings. An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was a party to the transaction. _Preference_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) if such liquidator or administrator believed that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. It will only be a preference if at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction the company is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the UK Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the company grants the security interest or the guarantee within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) prior to the Onset of Insolvency. A transaction may constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company's debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court has very wide powers for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given, which could include reducing payments under the Notes and the Note Guarantees (although there is protection for a third-party who enters into a transaction in good faith and without notice). For the court to determine a preference, however, it must be shown that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was insolvent and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company's employee), in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence. An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the company. _Transactions Defrauding Creditors_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or an administrator of a company, or a person who is a ""victim"" of the relevant transaction can apply to the court pursuant to Section 423 of the Insolvency Act for an order to set aside a security interest or guarantee granted by that company on the grounds that the security interest or guarantee was a transaction defrauding creditors. A transaction will constitute a transaction defrauding creditors if it is a transaction at an undervalue and the court is satisfied that the substantial purpose of a party to the transaction was to put assets beyond the reach of creditors with actual or potential claims against it, or to prejudice the interest of such persons. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, then it may make such order as it may deem fit to restore the position to what it was prior to the transaction or to protect the victims of the transaction (including reducing payments under the guarantee or setting aside the security interest or ----- guarantees), though there is protection for a third-party acting in good faith and for value without notice of the relevant circumstances. Any ""victim"" of the transaction (with the permission of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) may apply to the court under this provision, not merely liquidators or administrators. There is no time limit in English insolvency legislation within which the company must enter insolvency proceedings, and the relevant company does not need to have been unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction. The fact that the transaction was not entered into with a dishonest motive is no defense to the claim. It will suffice that the company's subjective purpose was to place the assets out of the reach of creditors or a particular creditor. There is no need to show that the intention was the sole purpose and a substantial purpose is likely to suffice. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Avoidance of Floating Charge_ Under English insolvency law, if a company in administration or liquidation grants a floating charge within a period of twelve months prior to the Onset of Insolvency (or two years if the parties are connected), then such floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge. If the floating charge is granted to an unconnected person, it can only be challenged if the grantor was insolvent (for the purposes of Section 123 of the UK Insolvency Act) at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge but this requirement does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. An administrator, or a liquidator (as applicable), does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest). _Dispositions in Winding-up_ Under Section 127 of the UK Insolvency Act, any dispositions of a company's property made after a winding-up has commenced is, unless the court orders otherwise, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Arrangements Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision from taking effect in accordance with its terms. The compulsory winding-up of a company is deemed to start when a winding-up petition is presented by a creditor against the company, rather than the date that the court makes the winding-up order (if any). _Extortionate Credit Transactions_ An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A credit transaction is ""extortionate"" if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. It is presumed, unless otherwise proved by the person extending the credit, that a transaction with respect to which an administrator or liquidator makes an application to set aside an extortionate credit transaction is extortionate. The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by a company up to three years before the day on which a company entered administration or liquidation. That ----- order may set aside, either in whole or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may also vary the terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction, the court may require any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator sums already paid under the transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It should be noted that there are no provisions for the protection of third parties who acquire interests in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g., assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the person who provided credit under it). _Connected Persons_ ""Connected person"" is defined by the UK Insolvency Act. The fact that the parties are connected can have various consequences. For example, in the case of a preference, the ""look back"" period (in which the transaction must have occurred prior to the Onset of Insolvency) is increased from six months to two years and, in the case of a floating charge for no new value, the ""look back"" period is increased from twelve months to two years. Furthermore, certain statutory presumptions arise where the parties are connected (so for example the debtor is presumed to have been influenced by a desire to prefer the counterparty where the parties are connected). Finally and most significantly, the solvency defense is not available in respect of the challenge of a floating charge for no new value where the parties are connected. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a ""security financial collateral agreement"" under the Financial Collateral Arrangements, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph. If a given transaction at an undervalue, preference or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the company with a ""connected person,"" then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out above). A ""connected person"" of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences or invalid floating charges, is a party who is: (a) a director of the company; (b) a shadow director; (c) an associate of such director or shadow directors; or (d) an associate of the relevant company. A party is associated with an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual's husband, wife or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual's husband, wife or civil partner; (d) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual; or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual's husband, wife or civil partner. A person is an associate of any person with whom he is in partnership and of the husband, wife or civil partner or relative of any individual with whom he is in partnership. A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company (and in this case, directors of a company are treated as employees of that company). A person is also an associate of any person whom he employs. A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate. A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company. The most common way of parties to become connected in the context of commercial transactions is by way of share security (where the lender may have control over the voting rights in respect of the shares upon a default) or by having common directors. _Security over Shares_ Security (other than by way of a legal mortgage) over shares granted by a company, under English law, are equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a charging company creates an encumbrance over the property in favor of the chargee but the charging company retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or may otherwise be at the discretion of the court. ----- The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security interests over shares may additionally be affected by a failure of the charging company or related parties or (in certain circumstances) the secured parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the disclosure and notification obligations under English company statutes in respect of persons with significant control. _Security over Bank Accounts_ With respect to any security over bank accounts (each a ""Bank Account Charge""), the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an ""Account Bank"") may hold a right at any time (at least prior to them being notified of a crystallisation event under the Bank Account Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other arrangements with the grantor of that security. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank's rights to exercise netting and set off with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Bank Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallised and converted into a fixed charge and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank's netting and set off rights. _Limitation on Enforcement_ Under English law, the grant of a Guarantee or other form of security by a company in respect of the obligations of another Group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the company's memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee or other security can be found to be void and the respective creditor's rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third-parties if they are dealing with the company in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for the company by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when this shift arises, the English courts have held that it takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with ""likely"" in this context meaning ""probable."" Security and/or guarantees granted by a company may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law. _Security Registration_ Under English company law, subject to limited exceptions, a certified copy of any security document pursuant to which a charging company incorporated in England and Wales grants security (including security governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) may be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant security interest (the ""Registration Period""). While the Companies Act does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the Registration Period. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the Registration Period has expired. The Financial Collateral Arrangements Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration with the Registrar of Companies. Security created by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales similarly does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies, although registration with applicable asset registries may still be required depending on the nature of the collateral assets. ----- _Corporate Authorizations and Maintenance of Capital_ The legality, validity and enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer and any Guarantor under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and any future security taken over the Notes are subject to matters affecting companies generally, including that: (i) its entry into and performance of such obligations: (a) are not prohibited by its constitutional documents (or contracts to which it is party); and (b) have been duly authorized and do not breach or result in inconsistency with applicable laws or regulations; and (c) the documents evidencing such obligations have been duly executed and delivered in accordance with all applicable procedures and laws. In addition, the granting of upstream (or cross-stream) guarantees or security by a company could be subject to challenge if it results in a reduction in that company's net assets as properly recorded in its books or, to the extent that it does, the company does not have sufficient distributable reserves to cover that reduction. _Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020_ On June 26, 2020, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (the ""CIGA"") enacted fundamental reforms to the United Kingdom's existing insolvency and companies legislation. There is limited guidance on how the legislation will be interpreted (given the insufficient jurisprudence since it came into force) and the Secretary of State may by regulations modify the exceptions. It is therefore possible that aspects of the legislation may change. _Moratorium_ The CIGA introduced a standalone moratorium to enable certain eligible companies to prevent creditors taking certain actions against the company for a specified period in order to to seek rescue options and reach an agreement with their creditors to facilitate a restructuring. Subject to certain exclusions and meeting requisite conditions, any company that is liable to be wound up under the UK Insolvency Act is eligible for a moratorium. Ineligible companies include certain financial services companies (including insurance and securitization companies as well as parties to capital market arrangements). Directors of any eligible non-overseas company may commence a moratorium by filing the requisite papers at court (known as the out-of-court-process). Companies subject to an outstanding winding up petition must apply to court for an order granting the moratorium, which will only be granted if the court is satisfied that the moratorium will result in a better result for the company's creditors as a whole than winding up without one (known as the in-court process). In addition, overseas companies must always use the in-court process. Both in- and out-of-court processes involve a statement from the directors of the company that, in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. Furthermore, a monitor, who is an insolvency practitioner appointed to oversee the moratorium, must separately confirm (among other things) that the moratorium would likely result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. This is an ongoing requirement in order for a moratorium to continue; indeed, a monitor must terminate the moratorium if, at any time, it becomes apparent that the company is unlikely to be rescued as a going concern and/ or keep up with its required payments. During a moratorium, creditors are restricted from taking enforcement measures against the company, including commencing insolvency and other legal proceedings and enforcing security without the leave of the monitor or the court. The CIGA includes a carve-out for enforcement of security financial collateral (or the taking of any step to enforce a collateral security charge), which are permitted. In contrast to a moratorium arising from an administration, a floating charge may not be crystallized during this new moratorium, nor may any restrictions on the disposal of a floating charge asset be imposed. A company subject to a moratorium has the benefit of a payment holiday in relation to certain debts incurred prior to the commencement of the moratorium. However, certain other debts, including those which arise under a contract or other instrument involving financial services (which would include capital market arrangements) entered into or incurred prior to the moratorium, are exempted from payment holidays and such liabilities are therefore required to be met as and when they fall due. In addition, the company must continue to pay ""moratorium debts"" (i.e., debts and liabilities to which the company becomes subject during or after the moratorium by reason of an obligation incurred during the moratorium). Failure to pay such liabilities, plus any debt incurred during the moratorium, which arise or become payable during the moratorium will compel the monitor to end the moratorium. ----- Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in the same way as expenses in an administration. Where a company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters into administration or liquidation within a twelveweek period, any unpaid moratorium debts and any pre-moratorium debts for which the company did not have a payment holiday (excluding financial debt accelerated during the moratorium), as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company, will have super-priority over any costs or claims in the administration or liquidation (except for claims of fixed charge creditors to the extent such creditors can be paid out of the assets charged). A moratorium will last for an initial period of 20 business days, which may be extended for a further 20 business days by the directors of the company. Where an extension is proposed, statements from the directors and the monitor must be filed with the court confirming that the qualifying conditions continue to be met. Further extensions (beyond 40 business days) will be available: - pursuant to an out-of-court filing for a period of up to one year from commencement, if more than 50% (by value) of secured and more than 50% (by value) of unsecured creditors vote in favor of the extension, unless in both cases, more than 50% (by number) of unconnected secured and unsecured creditors vote against the extension. Only creditors with pre-moratorium debt in respect of which the company has a payment holiday, which has fallen due or may fall due before the proposed revised end date of the moratorium, will have the right to vote; - pursuant to an application by the directors to court for such period as the court sees fit; - in connection with a company voluntary arrangement until the proposal is implemented, accepted or rejected by creditors or withdrawn by the company or the moratorium otherwise comes to an end; and - at the court's discretion in connection with a scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan. _Restructuring Plan_ The CIGA inserted Part 26A in the Companies Act, which provides for a court-supervised compromise procedure (the restructuring plan procedure) that is intended broadly to follow the process for a scheme of arrangement. Like a scheme of arrangement, a restructuring plan is a procedure which allows the English courts to effect a compromise of a company's liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors), but with the added possibility of a ""cross-class cram-down"" imposing the restructuring on creditors and/or shareholders without their consent, subject to certain conditions being met and the court being convinced to exercise its discretionary power to sanction the restructuring plan. While generally available to the same domestic and foreign companies as schemes of arrangement, a company seeking to enter into a restructuring plan process must show that (a) it has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern, and (b) a compromise or arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors (or any class of them) the purpose of which is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of any of those financial difficulties. A restructuring plan may be proposed by the debtor company, any creditor of the company or any liquidator or administrator appointed to the company. As with a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes depending on the rights of such creditors which will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and any new rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring plan. A restructuring plan will be deemed to be approved if at least 75% in value of the creditors present and voting at the meeting of at least one class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed compromise. There is no requirement for the approving creditors to constitute a majority in number of those creditors present and voting, and there is crucially no requirement for each and every voting class to approve of the plan, provided _that the court is satisfied that (a) none of the members of a dissenting class would be any worse off if the_ restructuring plan were to be sanctioned than they would be in the event of the ""relevant alternative"" and (b) the restructuring plan was approved by at least one class of creditors who would receive a payment or have a genuine economic interest in the company in the event of the ""relevant alternative."" The ""relevant alternative"" for the purposes of this assessment is whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned. By virtue of these mechanics, the restructuring plan process provides for the possibility of a ""cross-class cram-down,"" meaning the courts ----- may sanction a restructuring plan even if one or more classes of affected creditors do not vote in favor of the restructuring plan, effectively allowing the vote of one class of stakeholders to bind other classes. Following approval of the restructuring plan at the creditor meeting(s), the restructuring plan needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether the applicable statutory conditions have been met and may also consider whether the restructuring plan is just and equitable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or refuse to sanction the restructuring plan. Once sanctioned, the restructuring plan binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the restructuring plan, which shall be effective (in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court's order sanctioning the restructuring plan to the Registrar of Companies. As with schemes of arrangement, the commencement of a restructuring plan process does not automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings. _Restrictions on the Operation and Exercise of Ipso Facto Provisions_ The CIGA introduced a restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto clauses in order to preserve the continuity of the provision of goods and services to companies undergoing insolvency procedures. In general terms, ipso facto clauses are provisions in supply of goods or services contracts which allow suppliers to terminate the contract or supply or take any other action, or provide for the automatic termination of the contract or supply or the occurrence of any other event, upon the counterparty entering an insolvency procedure. Pursuant to the CIGA reforms, to the extent that the trigger event is the counterparty's entry into a ""relevant insolvency procedure"" (i.e., an administration, administrative receivership, company voluntary arrangement, liquidation and/or a restructuring plan), such clauses will be deemed void and suppliers will be unable to terminate the relevant contracts unless (subject to exemptions) the company or the relevant office-holder consents to the termination or the court grants permission on the basis that it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship. The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving financial services or entities involved in the provision of financial services, including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or guarantees, contracts for the purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and agreements which are, or form part of, arrangements involving the issue of a capital market investment (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act). _Cross-Border Recognition of English Insolvency and Restructuring Proceedings_ The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed by applicable treaties in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts' jurisdiction, proceedings and judgments and general principles of private international law such as comity and conflicts of laws rules applicable in the relevant jurisdictions. One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the ""Model Law""), which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and Great Britain, where it was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the ""Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations""). The Model Law provides for recognition of certain British insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if the ""centre of main interests"" of the relevant debtor is determined to be in Great Britain) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the ""centre of main interests"" is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in Great Britain) upon application by the relevant insolvency officeholder. The nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations provide for recognition in the United Kingdom of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its ""centre of main interests"") or non-main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment). If foreign insolvency proceedings are recognized under the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations, there will be a moratorium that is equivalent to the stay that arises in an English liquidation (i.e., a stay on the commencement or continuation of proceedings but not the enforcement of security). The foreign representative of the debtor can apply for wider relief (such as a stay on the enforcement of security) but this is at the discretion of the English court. The English court has held that only procedural relief (such as ----- stays) are available under the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations; the English court cannot recognize or give effect to a foreign insolvency judgment under these regulations. The recognition of English courts' jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the ""Hague Convention"") and the Lugano Convention 2007 (the ""Lugano Convention"") (subject to the United Kingdom's pending application to accede to the latter) where these apply. In addition, recognition may still be available under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (""Rome I""). The Lugano Convention and the Hague Convention both contain exclusions whereby they are deemed not to apply to judgments handed down in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. As the law currently stands, the English Court considers that restructuring plans fall within this exclusion due to the requirement that a company must have encountered or be likely to encounter financial difficulties in order to propose a restructuring plan. Unlike schemes of arrangement, restructuring plans therefore fall outside the scope of the Lugano Convention and the Hague Convention. The recognition of a restructuring plan in member states therefore depends upon Rome I and/or the domestic laws of those member states, and may be less straightforward than the recognition of a scheme of arrangement. _Assignments_ Any assignment of a debt or other chose in action, including by way of security, can only take effect as a legal assignment under Section 136 of the Law of Property Act if it meets the requirements of that provision, which are: (i) the assignment must be in writing; (ii) the assignment must be absolute and not purporting to be by way of charge only; and (iii) notice of the assignment must be given to the underlying obligor. If any of these requirements are not satisfied, the assignment may still constitute a valid equitable assignment. Equitable assignments, including by way of security, are subject to certain limitations, including but not limited to: (i) where an equitable interest is followed by a legal interest, the subsequent legal interest will take priority if the holder acquired it for value without notice of the equitable interest; and (ii) the priority of dealings in most equitable interests is determined by the time at which notice of such interest is given to the underlying obligor or to the person in control of that equitable interest. The first to give notice will take priority, if that person does not have actual or constructive notice of the prior interest and has given consideration for his or her interest. _Share Mortgages_ A mortgage of shares can only take effect as a legal mortgage if the relevant transfers of shares are registered, although it may still give rise to a valid equitable security interest. _Person with Significant Control Regime_ Pursuant to Part 21A of the Companies Act (and related Schedules 1A and 1B to the Companies Act), from April 6, 2016 certain UK incorporated companies, societates europaeae and limited liability partnerships (for the purposes of this paragraph, each a relevant company) must keep a register of certain registrable individuals and legal entities that have significant control over them. Failure of such registrable individuals or legal entities or other persons specified in Part 21A of (and Schedule 1B to) the Companies Act (for the purposes of this paragraph, each a notifying party) to comply with the requirements of that Part may give relevant companies the right to issue a restrictions notice to such notifying party for the purposes of Schedule 1B to the Companies Act. Subject to certain exceptions, the effect of a restrictions notice is that in respect of any relevant interest in the relevant company (as defined in Schedule 1B to the Companies Act, for example, a share in the relevant company): (a) any transfer of (or agreement to transfer) the interest is void; (b) no rights are exercisable in respect of the interest; (c) no shares may be issued in right of the interest or in pursuance of an offer made to the interest-holder; and (d) except in a liquidation, no payment may be made of sums due from the relevant company in respect of the interest, whether in respect of capital or otherwise. Such restrictions could adversely affect the validity of any future security interests over the security and the ability of a security agent to enforce its rights under English security documents. ----- _National Security and Investment Act 2021_ The National Security and Investment Act 2021 (the ""NSIA"") came into force in January 2022 as the United Kingdom's new national security screening regime. The NSIA gives the UK Government powers to scrutinize and intervene in transactions where control over certain entities or assets has been or will be ""acquired"" and this may give rise to a national security risk in the United Kingdom. The powers are broad and could affect lenders and security agents when taking and enforcing security over shares or assets, particularly in the 17 designated sensitive sectors. _Application of Proceeds_ The enforceability of a provision in a security document that relates to the application of proceeds will be subject to any obligations mandatorily preferred by applicable law. _Ranking_ The description given by the parties to the ranking of security interests is not determinative of the ranking of those security interests. _Prescribed Part_ An insolvency practitioner of the company (e.g., administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator) will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge realizations) (the ""Prescribed Part""). Under current law, this ring-fence applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of net floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company's net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors. The requirement for an insolvency practitioner to set aside a Prescribed Part of the company's property which is subject to a floating charge, and make it available for unsecured creditors, will not apply to any charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement (as described in the Financial Collateral Arrangements Regulations). _Foreign Currency of Debt_ Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts, any debt of a company payable in a currency other than British pounds sterling must be converted into British pounds sterling at the ""official exchange rate"" prevailing at the date when the debtor went into liquidation or administration. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court. The ""official exchange rate"" for these purposes is the middle exchange rate on the London Foreign Exchange Market at close of business as published for the date in question or, if no such rate is published, such rate as the court determines. Accordingly, in the event that the English Guarantor (or any other Guarantor who may be subject to the jurisdiction of the English court in respect of the opening of insolvency proceedings in England and Wales) goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date that the Issuer or such Guarantor (as the case may be) went into liquidation or administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Notes may become entitled. Any losses resulting from currency fluctuations are not recoverable from the insolvent estate. _Foreign Laws_ If, and to the extent that, an asset subject to security under a security document (or the obligor of any debt or other right against any person, which debt or right constitutes all or part of the property or rights subject to that security) is located in any jurisdiction other than England and Wales or is not governed by English law, the validity and priority of that security may be affected by any applicable foreign laws. ----- _Third Party Rights_ Security granted over debts from, or other rights against, third parties (including contracts and insurance policies) may be subject to any rights of those third parties. _Amendments_ An English court may interpret restrictively any provision purporting to allow the beneficiary of a guarantee or other suretyship to make a material amendment to the obligations to which the guarantee or suretyship relates without further reference to the guarantor or surety.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1852,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,1852.12,Italy,1852.12.1,Insolvency,"The following is a brief description of certain main aspects of the insolvency laws of Italy, focusing in particular on the rules governing the main insolvency and restructuring proceedings, which however does not include an overview of the special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where public entities (including sovereign-owned companies) or natural persons are involved. In any event, the below summary is not intended to be an exhaustive and comprehensive review and outlook of the Insolvency regime and tools currently in force under Italian law. In addition, certain provisions of Italian insolvency and restructuring law have been amended or have entered into force only recently and, therefore, may be subject to further implementation and/or interpretations and have not been tested to date in the Italian courts. The most recent and comprehensive reform of the Italian insolvency and restructuring regime has been approved by the Italian government on January 12, 2019, by enacting the Legislative Decree No. 14/2019 ""Codice della crisi di impresa e dell'insolvenza"" (Code of business crisis _and insolvency) (hereinafter, as subsequently amended and supplemented and including Legislative Decree_ No. 83 of 17 June 2022 implementing the EU Directive 2019/1023, the ""Italian Insolvency Code""), which was published in the Italian Official Gazette of February 14, 2019 and ultimately came into force, as subsequently amended, on July 15, 2022. The Italian Insolvency Code contains a comprehensive and organic reform of Italian insolvency proceedings and the rules governing business crisis, replacing the Italian royal decree n. 267 of March 16, 1942 (as amended from time to time, the ""Italian Bankruptcy Law"") as the main legislative source regulating such matter. Before formally and fully entering into force, the Italian Insolvency Code has been amended and supplemented by, among others, (i) the Italian Legislative Decree No. 147 of October 26, 2020; and (ii) the Italian Legislative Decree No. 83 of June 17, 2022, on ""Amendments to the Business Crisis and Insolvency Code, implementing Directive (EU) 2019/1023"" approved on March 17, 2022 by the Italian Council of Ministers (Consiglio dei Ministri). Except for minor changes including certain amendments to inter alia some provisions of the Italian Civil Code, which already entered into force on March 16, 2019, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic the entry into force of the Italian Insolvency Code was postponed multiple times. Certain innovations provided in the Italian Insolvency Code were anticipated and introduced by Law Decree No. 118 of 24 August 2021, as converted by Law No. 147 of 21 October 2021. Since July 15, 2022, the Italian Insolvency Code has been fully in force. For the sake of completeness only, it is noted that the provisions under the Italian Bankruptcy Law continue to apply only to any filings for proposals of declaration of insolvency procedures and in-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato fallimentare) and any filings seeking for the approval of debt restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) or for the opening of a composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo) filed or pending before July 15, 2022 (i.e., the effective date of entrance into force of the Italian Insolvency Code). In light of the above, the below is intended to summarize certain main aspects of the insolvency and restructuring regime under Italian law, as currently in force, and to describe the main characterizing elements and features of the insolvency and restructuring procedures as currently governed by the Italian Insolvency Code, which superseded the Italian Bankruptcy Law, and further applicable pieces of legislation. ----- Italian creditors' rights and insolvency laws are generally considered to be more favorable to debtors than the regimes of certain other jurisdictions. Generally speaking, in Italy, the courts play a central role in the insolvency process; moreover, the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be time consuming. Recently, the entrance into force of the Italian Insolvency Code has substantially amended the Italian insolvency regime and also introduced significant amendments to the rules governing restructuring and out-of-courts proceedings. Under Italian law, the state of insolvency (insolvenza) of a company is ascertained and declared by a court. Insolvency occurs at a time when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they fall due. This must be a permanent, and not a temporary, status. In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which may be susceptible to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions, provided that certain conditions are met. The following restructuring or insolvency remedies and proceedings are available under Italian law for companies facing financial difficulties or in a state of temporary crisis, and for insolvent companies: negotiated composition of the crisis (composizione negoziata della crisi) and simplified composition with creditors with liquidation purposes (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio), debt restructuring arrangements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 57 of the Italian Insolvency Code, reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56 of the Italian Insolvency Code, restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto _a omologazione), court-supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), extraordinary_ administration for large insolvent companies pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 270/99 (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi imprese in crisi di cui alla Legge Prodi bis), extraordinary administration proceedings for large insolvent companies pursuant to Italian Law Decree No. 347/2003 as converted by Law No. 39 of 18 February 2004 (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi imprese in crisi _di cui alla Legge Marzano); judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); and composition with creditors_ in the judicial liquidation (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale). Moreover, a specific set of rules, governing inter alia the voidability of intragroup transactions and the ranking of intragroup financing, are applicable where the insolvent company belongs to a corporate group. Depending on the type of proceeding to be initiated, the primary aims of restructuring and insolvency proceedings under Italian law are, respectively and alternatively, to successfully restructure or sell the debtor's assets as a going concern (as to the restructuring proceedings) or to liquidate the debtor's assets for the satisfaction of creditors' claims as well as, in case of the ""Prodi-bis"" procedure or ""Marzano"" procedure, to maintain employment, to the extent feasible. These competing aims have often been balanced by selling businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Save for the liquidation proceedings (mainly the judicial liquidation), the Italian Insolvency Code promotes rescue procedures rather than liquidation and focuses on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing restructuring options as an alternative to judicial liquidation. During judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) activities of credit recovery are interrupted (subject to certain exceptions). During the negotiated composition with creditors (composizione negoziata della crisi) and during the proceedings for admission to, and sanctioning of, debt restructuring arrangements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti), restructuring plans subject to homologation (piano di _ristrutturazione soggetto a omologazione) and court-supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), activities of credit recovery can be interrupted (provided that certain conditions apply)._",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The judicial liquidation is declared by a competent division of the court. Entities that can be adjudicated into judicial liquidation are those exercising commercial enterprises which exceed any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo _patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years,_ (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three ----- preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess (included debts not yet due) of €0.5 million. Upon the commencement of a judicial liquidation: - unless otherwise provided for by law, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period; in particular, under certain circumstances, secured creditors may enforce against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the insolvent entity's other unsecured debt. Subject to certain exceptions, the in rem secured creditor may sell the secured asset only after it has obtained authorization from the designated judge (giudice _delegato). After hearing the receiver (curatore nella liquidazione giudiziale) and the creditors'_ committee (if established), the designated judge decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the timing in its decision; - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets pass from the debtor to the receiver appointed by the competent court (curatore nella liquidazione giudiziale); and - any act (including payments, pledges and issuances of guarantees) made by the debtor, other than those made through the receiver, after (and in certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of a judicial liquidation with respect to the creditors is (or could be if made before) ineffective. The judicial liquidation proceeding is carried out and supervised by a court-appointed receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors' committee (if established). The creditors' committee, as specifically provided for by law, has in some cases authorization power over the receiver and, in general, consultation functions over the latter and vigilance authority over the judicial liquidation proceedings. The receiver is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor for the satisfaction of creditors. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority rights. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor's assets include real estate property. Italian law provides for priority to the payment of certain preferential creditors, including the receiver, employees and the Italian judicial and social security authorities. The following features of judicial liquidation proceedings also merit mention: - _Statutory priorities: the statutory priority assigned to creditors under Italian law may be different from priorities in the United States and certain other European jurisdictions. Under Italian law, claims with the highest rank are the super senior ones (crediti prededucibili), which include the claims associated with the judicial liquidation proceedings as set out in specific legislation. At the next level of priority there are preferred creditors, whose claims (crediti privilegiati) enjoy a preference in payment (in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law) which can be general (such as for claims for salaries, social contributions and taxes) or can pertain to specific assets, and secured creditors, whose claims are backed by mortgages (crediti ipotecari) and pledges (crediti garantiti da pegno), and then unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). In particular, creditors with mortgages (crediti ipotecari) and pledges (crediti garantiti da pegno) have priority in the distribution of what has been eventually obtained from the liquidation of the relevant secured assets. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles. Secured claims backed by mortgages and pledges will be treated as unsecured claims for the part of the claims not being repaid upon the liquidation of the relevant secured assets. The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire insolvency estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. - _Composition with creditors in the judicial liquidation (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale): a judicial liquidation proceeding can terminate prior to liquidation through a composition proposal with creditors. The relevant petition can be filed by one or more creditors or third parties starting from the declaration that opens the judicial liquidation, whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal only after one year following such declaration but before two years from the decree granting effectiveness to the statement of liabilities. The petition may provide for the placing of creditors into different classes (thereby proposing different treatments among the classes), the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors' claims in any manner. The petition may provide the possibility that secured claims are paid only in part. The concordato nella _liquidazione giudiziale proposal is subject to the opinion of the creditors' committee and must be_ ----- approved by the creditors holding the majority of unsecured claims (and, if classes are formed, by a majority of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court confirmation is also required; - _Management of the debtor's company upon admission to the Judicial Liquidation: the commencement of a Judicial Liquidation proceeding would not cause a cessation of business operations where a continuation order is made by the presiding judge pursuant to Article 211 of the Italian Insolvency Code. The continuation order may be declared in each of the following situations: (i) together with the judgment proclaiming the debtor's admission to the proceeding, provided that the prosecution of the debtor's activities is not detrimental to creditors; (ii) after the admission to the Judicial Liquidation, on the proposal of the liquidator and provided that such proposal has been authorized by the creditors' committee; and (iii) at the time when the liquidation plan shall be executed. The prosecution of the debtor activities may also be limited to specific/predetermined business lines or units; and - _Treatment of executory contracts upon admission to the Judicial Liquidation proceeding: the provisions laid down by the Italian Insolvency Code allow the receiver to elect to continue or reject future performance of executory contracts. Thus, certain types of executory contracts may be suspended, continued or terminated by the relevant receiver. If the performance of the executory contracts is continued, then the receiver must assume all the obligations stemming from the continued contracts. Amounts which become due to creditors in the context of the Judicial Liquidation proceeding must be paid in full in priority to amounts owing to other creditors. Conversely, whether the executory contracts are terminated, creditors are entitled to submit a claim for breach of performance, without in any event being entitled to damages by way of extracontractual liability. _Acts Ineffective by Operation of Law._ Under (i) Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the insolvent entity in the two-year period prior to the filing of the petition that led to the opening of the judicial liquidation of after the filing. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code becomes part of the insolvency estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of judicial liquidation, without need to wait the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge for violation of law; and (ii) Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the opening of the judicial liquidation or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the filing of the petition that led to the opening of the judicial liquidation of after the filing. _Acts that Could be Declared Ineffective at the Request of the Receiver._ The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below (so-called ""suspect",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The following acts and transactions, if made during the suspect period or such other period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the receiver proves that the non- insolvent party knew that the insolvent entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction: - payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into or made within six months prior to the filing of the petition that led to the opening of the judicial liquidation of after the filing; and - granting of security interest for debts incurred in the six months prior to the filing of the petition that led to the opening of the judicial liquidation of after the filing. The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions: - payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice; - a remittance on a bank account; provided that it did not entail a long-term reduction of the insolvent entity's debt towards the bank; - the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser's family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; _provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein_ or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein; - transactions entered into, payments made and security granted by the debtor over its assets pursuant to a plan (piano attestato) under Article 56 or 284 of the Italian Insolvency Code; - a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee granted in execution of a ""concordato preventivo"" or a sanctioned ""piano di ristrutturazione"" under Article 64-bis_ of the Italian Insolvency Code or a sanctioned ""accordo di ristrutturazione del debito"" as well as those legally performed after the application for concordato preventivo or accordo di ristrutturazione; - remuneration payments to the insolvent entity's employees and consultants concerning work carried out by them; and - payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services necessary for access to _strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell'insolvenza and insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Insolvency Code. In addition, in certain cases, the receiver can request that certain transactions of the insolvent entity be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the Italian Civil Code. Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the insolvent entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor's rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the insolvent entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the insolvent entity for the purpose of prejudicing the creditor's rights) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third party, the third party was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third party participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver. Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a ""simplified"" clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision ----- clawing back/nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so-called fondo patrimoniale or ""family trust""). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by the creditor against the third-party purchaser. - **Adequate organizational, administrative and accounting corporate structures.** One of the main novelties included in the Italian Insolvency Code concerns the definition of the organizational, administrative and accounting structures of a company which are deemed to be adequate under Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, required by the applicable regulations for the purpose of timely detection of the state of crisis and the undertaking of suitable initiatives by the debtor. Article 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code requires the entrepreneur to adopt an appropriate organizational structure in accordance with Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, for the purpose of timely detection of the crisis of the company as well as the timely undertaking of suitable initiatives to overcome the crisis and recover business continuity. However, neither the aforementioned Article 3, in its current wording, nor Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, as amended by the Italian Insolvency Code, contains a precise description of the parameters, conditions and characteristics that are deemed to be necessary/needed for the definition and especially for the identification of ""adequate structures."" In this regard, Article 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code precisely enunciates, on the one hand, the purposes to which the measures and structures must aim in order to be considered as adequate for the timely detection of the crisis and, on the other hand, the relevant warning signs in relation to the same. In this respect, it is stipulated that, for the purpose of the timely detection of the company's state of crisis, the measures and structures deemed to be adequate should make it possible to: (i) detect any imbalances of an equity or economic-financial nature, related to the specific characteristics of the company as well as to the business activity carried out by the debtor; (ii) verify the sustainability of debts and the prospects for business continuity for the next twelve months as well as the warning signs identified by Article 3, paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and (iii) derive the information necessary to follow the detailed checklist and conduct the practical test for the reasonable pursuit of the debtor's financial recovery. For the sake of completeness and as set out above, it should also be noted that Article 3, paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides an exact indication of the warning signs, identified, inter _alia, as follows:_ (i) the existence of payroll debts overdue for at least 30 days equal to more than half of the total monthly payroll amount; (ii) the existence of receivables owed to suppliers that are at least 90 days past due in an amount greater than the amount of receivables that are not past due; (iii) the existence of exposures to banks and other financial intermediaries that have been past due for more than 60 days or have exceeded the limit of credit facilities obtained in any form for at least 60 days provided that they represent in the aggregate at least 5% of the total exposures; and (iv) the existence of one or more exposures to certain public institutions listed under Article 25-novies of the Italian Insolvency Code.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The expert can only be selected and appointed among those possessing certain specific professional requisites and qualifications (e.g., being registered in the auditors' registrar), and meeting the requirements under Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code. The expert may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification. Agreements based on restructuring plans are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or other supervising authority. Out-of-court agreements based on restructuring plans do not require to be approved and consented by a specific majority of all outstanding claims. Following a restructuring plan, there is no entrustment of business to another entity, therefore the debtor remains entitled to manage its business. The terms and conditions of the agreements based on restructuring plans are freely negotiable. Agreements based on restructuring plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Insolvency Code provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be adjudicated into judicial liquidation, the payments and/or acts carried out for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to claw-back action; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the companies' register are needed (although, upon request of the debtor, the agreements based on the restructuring plan, the plan itself and the report of the independent expert (attestazione) can be published in the relevant companies' register and, in such case creditors would benefit from a reduction in debtor tax liability).",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

An independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that the agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following terms: (a) 120 days from the date of approval of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the nonparticipating creditors as at the date of the validation (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation of ""financial distress"" (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court's validation (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. The application for accordo di ristrutturazione is published in the companies' register and is effective as of the day of its publication. Starting from the date of such publication and if the debtor requested protective measures, creditors cannot start or continue any conservative or enforcement actions against the assets of the debtor in relation to pre-existing receivables and cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to pre-existing debts. Protective measures must be confirmed by the Court for a maximum 4-month period, which can be extended upon request. According to Article 64 of the Italian Insolvency Code, if the debtor files a petition for Protective Measures, creditors may not unilaterally refuse to perform executory contracts or terminate/accelerate such contracts or modify the terms thereof solely due to the filing of such petition. Any contractual provisions to the contrary are without effect. ----- Moreover, Article 64(4) of the Italian Insolvency Code goes on to provide that creditors affected by Protective Measures may not unilaterally refuse to perform, terminate, amend or accelerate any ""essential contracts"" solely due to the failure in payment by the debtor. For the purpose of the Italian Insolvency Code, ""essential contracts"" are those agreements which are considered necessary for the continuation of the ordinary/day-to-day management of the company, including supply contracts whose interruption would prevent the continuation of the activity of the debtor. The plan can therefore provide, among others, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The protective measures can also be requested by the debtor while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e., prior to the above-mentioned publication of the agreement), provided that the debtor files a declaration of an independent expert attesting that (i) negotiations are ongoing with creditors representing at least 60% of claims owned; and (ii) the plan (if approved) is adequate to ensure the repayments in full of the nonadhering creditors or the creditors who have denied their willingness to negotiate the plan. A court order is needed for the protective measures to be granted. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the validation of the debt restructuring agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies' register. After having settled the oppositions (if any) the court will validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 30 days of its publication. The threshold of 60% is reduced to the 30% pursuant to Article 60 of the Italian Insolvency Code, if the debtor (a) waives the 120-day term for the satisfaction of non-participating creditors (therefore implying that the plan must be adequate and capable for the full and timely payment of dissenting creditors); (b) does not request and waives to request the protective measures. Debtors are entitled to extend the application of debt restructuring agreements to non-participating creditors (including financial creditors) by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits belonging to the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their legal status and economic interests), and can request the court to declare that agreement binding on non-adhering creditors of the same category (a so- called ""cram-down""), _provided that certain conditions are met, including that non- participating creditors shall be satisfied to a no lesser extent than the liquidation alternative. The law also provides that (i) the agreement shall be of a non-liquidating nature, (ii) the agreement shall contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern, and (iii) all the creditors belonging to the relevant category (and, therefore, affected by the proceeding) have been duly notified of the beginning of the negotiations, have been kept informed and have been notified the debt restructuring agreement and the sanctioning decree (decreto di omologa) and the related documentation. If these conditions are met, the remaining 25% of non-participating creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, non-participating crammed down creditors can challenge the debt restructuring agreement. The threshold of 75% is lowered to 60% if the conclusion of the debt restructuring agreement results from the Final Report issued by the Expert at the end of the negotiations pertaining to the composizione negoziata _della crisi._ A special provision is set forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this situation the debt restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of creditors which are banks and financial intermediaries which have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend the effects of the agreement to non-participating creditors who are part of the same category. In such instance, the agreement is valid even if it does not contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern. However, in such case, the rights of creditors who are not banks or financial intermediaries remain valid. A standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and creditors representing 75% of the same class would also bind the non-participating creditors, provided that (A) an independent expert certifies **_(i) the truthfulness of the business data,_** **_(ii)_** the attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis and **_(iii)_** the fact that the non-adhering creditors suffer a prejudice that is proportionate and consistent with the recovery strategies undertaken by the debtor, and (B) certain further conditions are met (e.g., all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly ----- noticed of the beginning of the negotiations have been made able to participate in the negotiations and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor's assets, economic and financial situation and on the agreement and its related effects). Non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the standstill agreement within 30 days after having been notified of the same. The debt restructuring agreement and the standstill agreement shall not impose new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities on non-participating creditors. Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors that have adhered to the debt restructuring agreements. Non-participating creditors maintain their claims towards (i) those who are jointly and severally liable with the debtor, (ii) the debtor's guarantors and (iii) debtors by way of right of recourse (regresso). Unless agreed otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards the shareholders who are jointly liable with non- limited liability companies, provided that, if such shareholders have granted guarantees, they will remain liable as guarantors.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Only the debtor company can file a petition at court for a CP which must be accompanied and supported by a restructuring plan proposed to the creditors and an independent expert report assessing, inter alia, the feasibility of the arrangement proposal and the truthfulness of the business data on which the plan is grounded. Following the filing of the petition with the court, the petition is published by the court in the companies' register. The debtor can apply for Protective Measures. In addition, during this time, preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and the mortgages registered within 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the CP is published in the Italian companies' register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. In addition, the arrangement proposal may provide for, inter alia: (i) the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors' claims (provided _that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of_ composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato in continuità aziendale), in any manner, including by way of example, through extraordinary transactions such as the granting to creditors and their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (also convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities; (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the business involved in the proposed arrangement agreement; (iii) the placing of creditors into different classes (thereby proposing different treatments among the classes) (classes are mandatory when the restructuring plan provides for the business continuity); and (iv) different treatments for creditors belonging to different classes. Pursuant to Article 84, paragraph 4, the Italian Insolvency Code, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, a composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato _liquidatorio) (i.e., a composition with creditors proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors_ and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that (i) with the relevant filing for such proceeding, external resources are contributed which increase the assets available at the time of such filing by at least 10% and (ii) the degraded secured creditors as well as unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage equal to 20% of their total claims. In this respect, it should be noted that resources contributed for the purpose of a composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) may be distributed notwithstanding the provisions set forth under Articles 2740 and 2741 of the Italian Civil Code provided that such distribution complies with the 20% requirement set forth above. Resources contributed are considered as ""external"" when provided for any reason by the debtor's shareholders without obligation of repayment or subordination, in relation to which the plan ----- provides them to be for the sole benefit of the creditors. This provision does not apply to composition with creditors proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). Where the composition with creditors pursues the continuation strategy, creditors are prevented from unilaterally refusing the performance of executory contracts, terminating or accelerating such contract or amending their terms solely due to the filing of petition for admission to the procedure at stake, a court order granting such petition and/or a court granting Protective Measures. Any contractual provision to the contrary is without effect. The Italian Insolvency Code then goes on to further provide that creditors impacted by Protective Measures may not unilaterally refuse to perform, terminate, accelerate or amend ""essential"" agreements solely due to a failure in payment by the debtor prior to the filing of the petition seeking admission to the composition with creditors procedure. The restructuring plan can provide that: (i) the debtor's company's business continues to be run by the debtor company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated. In both cases, the petition for the CP should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert shall also certify that the continuation of the business (if envisaged by the plan) is not detrimental to creditors compared to a judicial liquidation. Furthermore the going concernbased composition with creditors can provide also the liquidation of those assets which are not functional to the business. The arrangement agreement may also provide a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The court determines whether the proposal for the arrangement is admissible, in which case the court, inter _alia, delegates a judge (giudice delegato) to follow the procedure, appoints one or more judicial_ commissioners (commissari giudiziali) and sets the timeframe and modalities for creditors to express their vote. After filing for composition with creditors, the company is managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors) under the supervision of such judicial officer(s) and under the supervision of a judge delegated by the court, and the debtor is allowed to carry out activities falling out of the ordinary course of business only upon the prior court's authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim acts legally carried out by the debtor, rank super-prior. The CP proposal envisaging the liquidation must be approved with the favorable vote of creditors representing the majority of claims entitled to vote. If the proposal provides for different classes of creditors, the approval of the plan also requires the favorable vote of creditors representing the majority of claims admitted to within each class and the approval of the majority of such class. In the event that a single creditor has claims in excess of the majority of the claims entitled to vote, the CP proposal is approved with the favorable vote of (i) creditors having the majority of claims entitled to vote, and (ii) the majority of creditors entitled to vote. When business continuity is envisages by the plan, the composition must be approved by all classes. Secured creditors do not generally vote on the proposal of CP as they carry preferential claims, which must be fully satisfied. Secured creditors may vote if they waive their security or if the CP provides that, based on an independent expert appraisal on the value of the secured assets, they will not be fully satisfied (in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of the debt affected by the proposal). In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the concordato proceedings, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies are largely untested in the Italian courts (recent case law has however affirmed the right of noteholders whose vote may be tainted by conflict of interest as could be the case of disenfranchised noteholders to be computed for the purposes of relevant quora and be admitted to voting, albeit in a specific class). Among others, (i) the companies controlling the debtor, controlled by the debtor and those under the control of the entity controlling the debtor, (ii) the assignees of the claims of the entities under point (i), if the assignment has been perfected during the year preceding the concordato and (iii) creditors in conflict of interest are excluded from voting. The court may approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the non-adhering creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions (in particular in comparison with the judicial liquidation). ----- The court approves the concordato preventivo even in the absence of a vote by the tax authority or by the social contribution entities (enti gestori di forme di previdenza o assistenza obbligatorie) when their positive vote is decisive for the purposes of achieving the majorities referred to in Article 109, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code, also on the basis of the result of the report of the independent expert referred to in Article 88 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the proposal to satisfy the aforesaid authorities and entities is convenient compared to a judicial liquidation scenario. In case of business continuity, the Court can validate the plan even when not all classes voted in favor of the composition and the debtor so requests, occurring certain conditions, including that creditors of dissenting class are treated equally with respect to the same rank classes and better than creditors of classes ranking lower. If in the composition with business continuity the creditor opposes the validation of the composition on the basis that this is not convenient, the Court can still validate the same creditor is better treated than in a judicial liquidation scenario. If liquidation is envisaged by the plan, the court can also validate the CP when - if the proposal does not provide for classes of creditors and if any opposition to the validation of the CP is filed by at least 20% of the creditors entitled to vote, or in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, - the treatment of the relevant creditors' claims not detrimental compared to a judicial liquidation. Creditors holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor are entitled to present an alternative plan to the debtor's plan in a CP subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari). If a plan in a CP includes a binding offer for the sale of the debtor's assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the court starts an auction. After the creditors' approval, the court (after having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if any) must validate the CP proposal by issuing a validation order. If the approval of the CP fails, the court can, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor and after having ascertained the condition for declaration, adjudicate the company into judicial liquidation. The terms and the performance of the outstanding contracts which have been entered into, from time to time, by the debtor are not automatically affected by the concordato preventivo proceeding and normally continue pending the procedure, any agreement to the contrary being ineffective. However, pursuant to Article 97 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti) if the continuation of such agreements is inconsistent with the prospects and the execution of the composition with creditors' plan, except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application for the _concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the_ procedure. Upon the debtor's request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time (a)_ between 30 and 60 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi) or in the event where filings for a judicial liquidation proceeding are pending, renewable just once. When the composition proposal together with the relevant plan have been submitted, the suspension may also be authorized by the court for a further duration, which, however, may not exceed thirty days from the date of the decree opening the procedure, which may not be further extended. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid in accordance to the _concordato preventivo proposal as a pre-existing claim._ Pursuant to Articles 119 and 120 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the event of a breach of the composition with creditors plan or fraud, _provided that the relevant requirements are met, the_ _concordato_ can be terminated or annulled, as the case may be, upon petition of one or more of the creditors and the judicial liquidation may follow, at the behest of the relevant court. If the composition with creditors is implemented, terms and conditions of payments are amended as per the concordato proposal, and the debtor may return to its usual operations (if the assets of the company are still in his possession). Concordato preventivo is ----- compulsory for all creditors prior to the publication of the application in the companies' register. However, creditors retain without prejudice their rights against co-debtors and guarantors of the debtor. In case of non-minor breaches, the concordato may be terminated by each of the creditors or the judicial commissioner (in case of petition by one or more of the creditors). The relevant lawsuit must be brought within one year from the deadline originally scheduled for the last activity to be carried out under the _concordato itself. The concordato may also be annulled upon request of the judicial commissioner or of_ one or more creditors in case a portion of the assets of the debtor has been concealed or the liabilities have been willfully exaggerated. The relevant lawsuit must be brought within six months from the discovery of the concealment/exaggeration and, in any event, within two years from the deadline originally scheduled for the last activity to be carried out under the concordato itself.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

In particular, the distressed company can file a pre-application asking the competent_ court to set a deadline, between 30 and 60 days (subject to a further extension of up to 60 days) for the filing of additional documents required for the filing of a petition at court for a CP or for the filing of a restructuring plan or of a debt restructuring agreement. The court can appoint a judicial commissioner to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 106 of the Italian Insolvency Code (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of non-existent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), shall report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition and sets forth reporting and information duties of the company during the above mentioned period. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (relating also to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company shall file, on a monthly basis, the company's financial position, which is published, the following day, in the companies register. Noncompliance with these requirements results in the pre-application being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors, of the public prosecutor or of the bodies or authorities supervising the company and _provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into judicial liquidation. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, _ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the pre application and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary course of business and (ii) seek the court's authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its extraordinary course of business, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior indebtedness authorized by the court are treated as super priority claims (prededucibili) and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action. _Interim financing - Article 99 Paragraph 1 to 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code_ Pursuant to Article 99, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the context of restructuring transactions on a going concern basis, also in cases in which business continuity is maintained exclusively in a view of liquidation, the Court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 57 (or Article 60 or 61) of the Italian Insolvency Code or a petition pursuant to Article 87 of the Italian Insolvency Code (in relation to the court-supervised composition with creditors procedure described above) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such indebtedness, subject to the court's authorization with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, _provided that: (i) the petition specifies (A) the purpose of the financing; (B) that the debtor is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (C) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the going concern or to the proceedings; and (ii) the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until ----- the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financing are functional to the continuity of the business activities until the sanctioning (omologazione) of the relevant insolvency proceedings or to the opening of the proceedings or to conduct them and, in any case, are aimed at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors. The expert report is not necessary in case the court recognizes that there is the urgent need to avoid an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the going concern. In the event of the subsequent admission of the debtor to the judicial liquidation proceeding (liquidazione giudiziale), the aforementioned financings do not enjoy the super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case the petition or the expert report contain false data or omit important information or in case the debtor performed acts in fraud of the creditors (atti in frode ai creditori) and the judicial receiver proves that who made available such financings to the debtor, had knowledge of such circumstances at the date of the disbursement. _Bridge Financings - Article 99 Paragraph 5 of the Italian Insolvency Code_ Pursuant to Article 99, paragraph 5, of the Italian Insolvency Code, financings (together with the related claims) granted, in any form, in view of (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for the sanctioning (omologazione) of a debt restructuring agreement or a court-supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) (finanza ponte), may be granted such priority status provided that (i) they meet the requirements of Article 99, paragraphs 1 and 2 (described above), and (ii) it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority status is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement or the approval of the _concordato preventivo. The indebtedness under such financing option may be secured, subject to the court's_ authorization, with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims. _Implementation financing - Article 101 of the Italian Insolvency Code_ In restructuring transactions on a going concern basis, pursuant to Article 101 of the Italian Insolvency Code, any financing granted to the debtor pursuant to a debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised pre-judicial liquidation composition with creditors) sanctioned by the competent court and expressly provided for in the relevant plan, enjoy super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent judicial liquidation, save for the below according with the provisions set forth in Article 221 of Italian Insolvency Code. In the event of the subsequent admission of the debtor to the judicial liquidation proceeding (liquidazione giudiziale), the aforementioned financings do not enjoy the super senior priority status (prededucibilità) in case the composition plan or the debt restructuring agreement, on the basis of an assessment to be made at the time of the relevant filing, results to be based upon false data or omission of relevant information or in case the debtor performed acts in fraud of the creditors (atti in frode ai creditori) and the judicial receiver proves that who made available such financings to the debtor, had knowledge of such circumstances at the date of the disbursement. _The shareholders' financing — Article 102 of the Italian Insolvency Code_ Pursuant to Article 102, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code super senior ranking status also applies to any financings made available by shareholders in any form (including any guarantee facility or granting counter-indemnities) up to 80% of their amount. Paragraph 2 of Article 102 of the Italian Insolvency Code clarifies that, to the extent the financing is made available by an entity becoming a shareholder in the context of and by way of implementation of a composition with creditors or debt restructuring agreement, all the claims deriving from such financings benefit of super senior ranking status and the 80% threshold limitation set out in paragraph 1 does not apply. _Super senior ranking - Article 99 Paragraph 6 and 101 Paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code_ Super senior ranking _(prededucibilità) of the claims is the most relevant feature of bridge financings, interim financings and implementation financings as described in the paragraphs above. Pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the claims deriving from such financings are expressly qualified as super senior by law and by Article 6, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code which clarifies that their super senior ranking natures continues in the context of any subsequent insolvency or enforcement proceedings (including in a judicial liquidation or any so-called minor proceedings). As already explained above, super senior ranking nature of such financings will be excluded in case of acts of fraud (which may be relevant also in the context of debt restructuring agreements). ----- Such limit to super senior ranking is regulated differently for interim financings and bridge financings on the one side and for the implementation financings on the other side. More specifically, for interim financings or bridge financings false data or omission of relevant information are relevant when found by the court in the request for the incurrence of the financings or the attestation of the independent expert, whilst for implementation financings such elements are relevant when on included in plan underlying the composition with creditors or the debt restructuring agreement. With reference to interim financings and bridge financings, Article 99 paragraph 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides that, in case of the opening of a judicial liquidation, such financings (although authorized by the court in the context of the composition with creditors or the debt restructuring agreement) do not benefit from super senior ranking when it is proved (jointly) that: (a) the request or the independent expert report contains false data or omits relevant information, or when the debtor has committed acts to defraud creditors in order to obtain the authorization; and (b) the receiver proves that the entities who provided the financing, at the date of issuance, knew the aforementioned circumstances. With reference to implementation financings, the relevant provisions are set out in Article 101 paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code providing that such financings do not benefit from the super senior ranking, in case of the opening of a judicial liquidation (alternatively): (a) when, based on an assessment to be made at the time of filing of the petition for the opening of the proceeding, the plan underlying the composition with creditors or debt restructuring agreement turns out to be based on false data or on the omission of relevant information; or (b) when the debtor has carried out acts of fraud towards its creditors and the receiver proves that the lenders providing the financings were aware of such circumstances at the time of the establishment of the financings.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

This new tool takes the form of a restructuring framework that may disregard the distribution rules of regular insolvency proceedings but can be enacted provided that strict requirements are met. In this regard, it should be noted that recourse to this instrument will be reserved for a debtor in crisis or insolvent that plans to satisfy its creditors by dividing them into classes according to homogeneous legal positions and economic interests. This instrument allows the plan's proceeds to be distributed even in derogation of the principle of ""par condicio creditorum"" (i.e., the equal treatment of creditors), provided that the proposal is approved by unanimous consent of the classes. A judgement of admissibility is provided for by the court, which is called upon to assess the proposal's timeliness and to verify the correctness of the class formation criteria. Application for the approval by the court of a restructuring plan must follow the steps of the common framework applicable to all restructuring tools and frameworks (i.e., _concordato preventivo, debt restructuring agreement and also to judicial liquidation). The regulation of the restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), from the date of submission of the application until its approval, is based on the model of the negotiated crisis settlement: the entrepreneur maintains the ordinary and extraordinary management of the company in the prevailing interest of the creditors under the supervision of the judicial commissioner. The debtor is, in any case, allowed to amend the application at any time, formulating a proposal of composition with creditors (concordato preventivo). In that case, the time limit for approval is shortened. Similarly, the debtor that has filed an application for composition with creditors may amend the application by applying for approval of the restructuring plan _provided that the application is made before voting commences. In each class, the proposal is approved if_ a majority of the claims allowed to vote is reached or, failing that, if two-thirds of the claims of the voting creditors have voted in favor, provided that creditors holding at least half of the total claims of the same class have voted. The court will approve the restructuring plan in the event of approval by all classes. If a ----- dissenting creditor objects to the proposal, the court will approve and homologate the restructuring plan if the proposal satisfies the claim to a not lesser extent than the one resulting from a judicial liquidation. In summary the restructuring plan subject to homologation _(piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad _omologazione) thus represents for the debtor an opportunity instrument which minimizes the admissibility_ phase, providing greater freedom of action, but requiring the approval of all classes of creditors in order to be effectively approved. Against the judgment of the court ruling on the approval of the restructuring plan subject to homologation _(piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), the parties may file an appeal to the competent court_ of appeal within the term of 30 days from the notification of the relevant judgement of the court. _Court-supervised composition for small debtors_ The Italian Insolvency Code provides for a simplified court-supervised composition in case the debtor does not meet the dimensional requirements to access other restructuring tools. Procedural steps and effects do essentially mimic those of the _concordato preventivo, but it entails the involvement of the board for crisis settlement (organismo di risoluzione della crisi), which assists the debtor in preparing the paperwork and filing the petition, and performs the activities and duties which, in a _concordato preventivo are prerogatives of the judicial commissioner._",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The same rules set forth for the judicial liquidation proceeding with respect to creditors' claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding as well as the hierarchy of claims to be adhered to in distributing any available asset. Preferential payment is granted to those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company business activity. To qualify for this procedure, the company must have employed at least 200 employees in the previous year. In addition, it must have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income from sales and services during its last financial year. The procedure may be commenced by petition of one or more creditors, the debtor, the public prosecutor or upon the competent court's own initiative. There are two main phases within the Prodi-bis procedure: an administrative phase and a judicial phase. In the administrative phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints a judicial receiver (or three) (commissario giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization. The judicial receiver submits a report to the court (within 30 days from insolvency declaration) together with an opinion from the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (the ""Ministry""). The court has 30 days to decide whether to admit the company to the Prodi-bis procedure or adjudicate it into judicial liquidation. Assuming that the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the judicial phase begins and the extraordinary commissioner(s), appointed by the Ministry, prepare a restructuring plan. From the date of commencement, creditors are prohibited from undertaking or continuing executive measures against the debtors or its assets. Moreover, there is a provision to the effect that, until such time as the administrator elects to reject the performance of outstanding executory contracts, the contracts will continue to be subject to performance. The plan can provide for either the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the ""Disposal Plan"") or a turnaround leading to the company's economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the ""Recovery Plan""). It may also include an arrangement with creditors (e.g., debt for equity swap, issue of shares in a new company to whom the assets of the Issuer have been transferred). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner(s). The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan; however, should either plan fail, the company will adjudicated into judicial liquidation. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

This is an extraordinary administration procedure introduced in 2003, known as the ""Marzano procedure."" It is complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to be faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the judicial phase. The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor's request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company's insolvency. The extraordinary commissioner(s) submits a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan within 180 days from his appointment (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees). The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be fully implemented within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years.

Among other things, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code and for the purposes of a successful restructuring, the plan may provide for ""any modification of the articles of association of the _debtor company, including capital increases and reductions, including with limitation or exclusion of the option right and other modifications that directly affect the shareholders' participation rights, as well as for mergers, demergers and transformations."" Shareholders, who may no longer have an interest in the_ company, are prevented from hindering the restructuring or even one of its stages. For this reason, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the shareholders, while retaining a right to information in relation to both the initiation and the progress of the restructuring process, may not remove the directors without just cause, as is the case for the statutory auditors of joint stock companies, also in light of the fact that under the provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code it is not considered as being just cause for directors' removal, the filing for access to the pre- judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell'insolvenza) when the related legal conditions and requirements are met. However, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraph 5, shareholders representing at least 10% of the filing company's corporate capital may make a competing proposal. The plan may provide for the formation of one class of shareholders or several classes if there are shareholders to whom different rights are granted by the by-laws, including as a result of the changes provided for in the plan. The formation of classes is, however, mandatory if the plan provides for changes that directly affect the shareholders' participation rights and, in any case, for large companies and companies with widespread capital. In this context, special conditions for approval of the composition with creditors are set out pursuant to Article 120-quater of the Italian Insolvency Code when and if the plan provides for shareholder attributions. Specific rules are then provided to ensure that creditors' interests are protected in all cases in which the restructuring tool envisages shareholders to retain a participation in the company with a certain value. ----- Article 120-quinquies of the Italian Insolvency Code, regulates the execution phase of such measure. In order to avoid any obstructive attitude of the shareholders towards the approval of the restructuring tool, this provision expressly excludes the necessity for their approval and/or resolution on the implementation of such restructuring tool, by generally attributing the relevant powers to the directors or more specifically to the competent court, in relation to any amendment to the debtor's by-laws which - being specifically provided for by the plan - do not require any discretionary resolution. Finally, it is stipulated that changes in the corporate structure resulting from the implementation of a pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell'insolvenza) shall not be considered as and constitute cause for the termination or amendment of any agreement entered into by the debtor with third parties. Articles 284 and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code contain specific rules regarding (i) the access of a group to one of the pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e _dell'insolvenza) aiming at unifying — to the extent possible — the relevant proceedings; (ii) liability_ lawsuits available to the receiver; and (iii) subordination of claims.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

If the guarantee or security interests are being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered. An Italian company granting a guarantee or security interests must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interests being provided by such company. In relation to security interests or guarantees, while corporate benefit for a downstream security or guarantee (i.e., a security or a guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries (pursuant to Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) of that relevant guarantor) can usually be easily proved, the validity and effectiveness of an upstream and cross-stream guarantees (i.e., a security or a guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant guarantor), depends on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive some benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. In particular, in case of upstream and cross-stream security interests or guarantees for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of a guarantee fee or access to cash flows in the form of intercompany loans from other members of the Group. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation and is determined on a case-by-case basis, further its existence is purely a factual analysis made by the company's directors and statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although in certain circumstances, and subject to specific strict rules, the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. In particular, in case of up-stream and cross-stream guarantees or security for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. Generally, the risk assumed by an Italian guarantor or grantor of security must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. To this extent, customary ""limitation language"" is usually inserted in indentures (or other similar agreements pursuant to which debt instruments (such as the Notes) are issued), credit agreements, guarantees and/or security documents for the purpose of limiting the amount guaranteed and/or secured by the guarantor to an amount that is proportionate for the direct or indirect economic benefit to the guarantor derived from the transaction. Absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the guarantee and security or the collateral ultra vires and potentially affected by conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Thus, civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of the guarantor if it is assessed that they did not act in the best interest of the guarantor and that the acts they carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the guarantor or ----- were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising a control or power of 'direction and coordination' over the guarantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, there could also be the risk, according to certain interpretations, that a guarantee and security can be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interests of the guarantor. More precisely, pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article 2475-ter of the Italian Civil Code, if a director of a company which entered into one or more agreements pursuant to which that company granted a guarantee or security interest had an interest conflicting with that of such guarantee or security provider, that company may ask that the relevant documents pursuant to which such guarantee or security interests have been granted to be voided (annullati), if such conflict of interest was (or ought to be) known by the other parties to such documents. In addition, pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article 2391 of the Italian Civil Code, if the resolution taken by the board of directors of a company approving the transactions contemplated by, and the entering into by that company, the documents pursuant to which such guarantee or security interests are granted has been taken with the decisive vote of a director having either a personal or third party's interest or such interest has not been disclosed to the other directors and the statutory auditors of the company or the resolution does not provide an appropriate explanation of the reasons that justify such transactions and the corporate benefit deriving therefrom in favor of the relevant company, and provided that such resolution can cause a damage to the company, the resolution may be challenged by the directors and statutory auditors within 90 days from its date of approval. The resolution may be challenged also by the shareholders of the company, if it is prejudicial to their rights (Article 2388, paragraph 4, of the Italian Civil Code). The rules on corporate benefit apply equally to security provided by subsidiaries in relation to the financial obligations of their parent or sister companies. As to corporate authorizations, the granting of a guarantee or security by an Italian company must be permitted by the applicable laws and by the articles of association (statuto) of the Italian company. In addition, the granting of a security or a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability which would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code, pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or subscription by a third-party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of an Italian company's own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation of financial assistance provisions. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. Directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the company. In order to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, inter alia, corporate benefit and financial assistance, the maximum amount that the Italian Guarantor may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as a Guarantor under the relevant guarantee and/or security interest and any other transaction documents related thereto, will be subject to limitations. By virtue of these limitations, the relevant guarantee and/or security interest will be significantly less than the amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or that relevant Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under the relevant guarantee and/or security interest. In any case, as a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law with respect to, among others, financial assistance and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the guarantee and security interest provided by the Italian Guarantor will be limited. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant guarantee and security. In the light of the above, under the Indenture the guarantee or security provided by the Italian Guarantor will be subject to certain restrictions or limitations, including, inter alia, the followings: (1) the guarantee or security will not secure any amounts the purpose of which is to finance or refinance, directly or indirectly, the acquisition of the Italian Guarantor and/or the subscription in any shares or quotas in the Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect shareholder(s) or quotaholder(s)) and/or the payment of any fees, costs and expenses, stamp, registration or other taxes in connection therewith; ----- (2) the guarantee or security will be in any case limited to an amount equal to the aggregate of the principal outstanding amount of any loan made available at any time to the Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries pursuant to Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer and/or any Guarantor after the Issue Date; (3) the guarantee will be limited to a specific maximum amount, pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code; and (4) no Italian Guarantor shall be liable for any amount in excess of the amount that such Italian Guarantor is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or _surrogazione) arising as a result of the enforcement of the relevant guarantee._ The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and security shall be distributed amongst the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the provision of the Intercreditor Agreement.

It is uncertain and untested in Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security can be created and perfected in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) that are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries and, therefore, the risk of unenforceability by the holders of the ----- Notes of the Italian security documents posed by Italian law cannot be eliminated or mitigated, with respect to such holders of the Notes which are not directly parties to the relevant security documents nor are specifically identified therein. Due to the impossibility to clearly identify and keep track over time of the names of the individual holder of the Notes, the Italian security, to the extent applicable, will be created in favor of the Security Agent acting in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code, of all secured creditors. It is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a ""trustee"" since there is no established concept of ""trust"" or ""trustee"" under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a ""trustee"" as trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law. Given the above and considering that the holders of the Notes are not party to the Italian law-governed security documents, there is a risk that an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes (in relation to which the relevant perfection formalities acknowledging their status as a secured creditor are not perfected at the time of enforcement) are not secured by the security interests created under the Italian lawgoverned security documents and/or cannot enforce that security interest. To address the above potential issue, the collateral securing the Notes will be granted and perfected, to the extent applicable, in favor of the Security Agent acting also in its capacity as legal representative (mandatario con rappresentanza) of the holders of the Notes. In bond issuances made by Italian joint stock companies (società per azioni), pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code (introduced by Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), security interests can be validly created in favor of an agent (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be authorized to enforce them on behalf of the holders of the Notes. However, the provisions and the subject matter of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code are untested by Italian Courts and, therefore, even if the appointment of the _rappresentante is upheld by an Italian Court, it cannot be excluded that an Italian Court may take a different_ view and interpretation and determine that, where the collateral is only granted in favor of the _rappresentante, the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the collateral and/or_ cannot enforce that collateral, in particular as such Notes will issued by a non-Italian entity.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a _società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower's indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (""undercapitalization""). Pursuant to Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code, any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a judicial winding-up declaration are ineffective by operation of law. The new provision replaced Article 2467, paragraph 1, of the Italian Civil Code, according to which such payments would be required to be returned to the borrower. In addition to that, Article 292, paragraph 1, of the Italian Insolvency Code sets forth that claims of entities exercising management and coordination powers _vis-à-vis_ the entities subject to such powers and claims of the entities subject to such powers vis-à-vis the entities exercising them deriving from loans granted after the filing of petitions resulting in the opening of judicial winding up of in the year before, are subordinated. The above rules apply to shareholders' loans ""made in any form"" and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also ----- applies to companies incorporated as _società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a società per azioni. Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may apply such provisions relating to Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer's relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer's ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interests granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The two primary goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor's assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and security interests could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy or judicial liquidation receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or clawback of (i) the Italian Bankruptcy Law (if applicable ratione temporis) and/or (ii) the Italian Civil Code, the Italian Insolvency Code and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during the suspect period. For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of claw-back actions in an insolvency scenario, see ""Judicial Liquidation"" section above. If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents. Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by the Italian Guarantor apply and/or there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor. According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general may be subject to, among others, the following aspects: - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or affecting the rights of creditors; - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Italian court; - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code; - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim; ----- - pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations (compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable; - where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on reasonable grounds; - the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione _necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to_ Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian law; - there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so; - enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del _diritto);_ - the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code; - any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code); - an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil Code are satisfied; - an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis; - in case of bankruptcy (filed or pending before July 15, 2022) or a judicial liquidation, a receiver is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the court and creditors' committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the court or, in case of judicial liquidation, to have the pledged assets assigned at a fair market value returning any excess to the judicial liquidation estate; - the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls or, in the absence of seizure/attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding or bankruptcy/judicial liquidation proceedings; - in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the ----- relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document; - there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance waivers or forfeitures; - the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory provisions; - penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court; - any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian company, which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, among others, any obligation to pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted under the Italian law no. 108 of March 7, 1996 (i.e., the Italian usury law), as amended from time to time and related implementing rules and regulations; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any compounding of interest which does not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an agreement executed after the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993 (the ""Italian Banking Act"") may not be enforceable; - if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other parties to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other parties as a consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement; - Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation; - a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the secured creditor from continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and - in case of bankruptcy (to the extent applicable after July 15, 2022) or judicial liquidation of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding or in case of a judicial liquidation the pledged assets can also be assigned to secured creditors at a fair market value and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/shares. In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a claw- back action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Articles 2901 and following of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor's right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings: - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and - that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent design. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The Expert's appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties have not agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur's distressed situation. However, the Expert's appointment can continue for up to an additional 180 days if (i) all the parties involved in the negotiations require so and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the appointment is required by the fact that the entrepreneur has filed a petition to the court for the Measures or certain authorizations. Pursuant to Article 17(5) of the Italian Insolvency Code, during the composizione negoziata della crisi the Expert may invite the parties to re-determine, according to good faith, the terms of the contracts for continuous, periodic performance or deferred performance if the performance on the debtor's side has become excessively burdensome or the contractual equilibrium has changed as a result of intervening circumstances. The parties are required to collaborate together to re-determine the contractual terms or to adjust the performance to the changed circumstance. Although Article 17(5) of the Italian Insolvency Code does not include a specific power for a judge or for the Expert to amend or alter the terms of the contracts in question if the parties are unable to find an agreement as to the changes to be made, the last sentence of paragraph 5 of Article 17(5) of the Italian Insolvency Code provides that the parties are bound to cooperate to amend the content of the contract. According to Law Decree no. 118/2021, which continues to be in force although has not been transposed into the provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code, a similar re-determination power as to the content and terms and conditions of agreements is granted in the context of the procedure at stake to the presiding judge where the contractual equilibrium has been jeopardized or affected by circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. As opposed to the scenario contemplated under Article 17(5) of the Italian Insolvency Code, in this case the presiding judge may directly order the modification of the terms of an agreement where alleged to give rise to a very vague standard of ""excessive burden"" or ""changed circumstances"" due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ----- At the end of his/her appointment the Expert issues a final report (the ""Final Report"") and notifies it to the entrepreneur and to the court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any), which declares the termination of their related effects. Together with the petition for appointment of the Expert, or with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of Protective Measures. From the date of publication of the relevant petition, preexisting creditors cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur and all enforcement and interim actions are stayed. Payment of preexisting creditors is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to employees' claims. From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures until the date of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for appointment of the Expert, the judicial liquidation proceeding cannot be opened nor the entrepreneur can be declared insolvent by the court. The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform their obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate their expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on the ground of the missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures. If the entrepreneur applies for the Protective Measures (which, as said, are immediately effective), it must simultaneously file a petition to the competent court, in order to allow a judge to check the said Protective Measures and to confirm them or, if necessary, to modify them. In the context of the same petition, the debtor may also ask the judge to be granted with Interim Measures where such measure are necessary to conduct the negotiations with the creditors in the context of the Negotiated Composition. In the absence of this petition, the Protective Measures will be ineffective. The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by an order of the court in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the opinion of the Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a maximum of 240 days. Upon request of the entrepreneur or of one or more creditors, or upon report of the Expert, the Protective Measures and the Interim Measures can be revoked, or their duration can be reduced, if they do not satisfy the purpose of a positive finalization of the negotiations or appear to be disproportionate compared to the prejudice caused to the creditors that file the relevant request. If the Protective Measures are revoked, the prohibition on creditors from pursuing enforcement actions ceases to be effective for the date on which the Protective Measure has been revoked. During the procedure the entrepreneur remains able to continue the ordinary and extraordinary management of the company, subject to certain conditions. More precisely, pursuant to Article 21 of the Italian Insolvency Code, pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary activity, and, upon written notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary activity or make payments non-consistent with the negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery. Furthermore, if during the course of the negotiations, it appears that the entrepreneur is insolvent but there are real prospects of recovery, the entrepreneur shall manage the enterprise in the best interests of the creditors, subject to his liabilities. If the Expert believes that an extraordinary management act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the perspectives of recovery, he/she reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise's control body. If, notwithstanding the Expert's report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the entrepreneur gives immediate notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with the companies' register. Extraordinary management acts and the payments in relation to which the Expert's dissent has been registered may be subject to a claw-back action (and thus set aside) according to Articles 165 and 166 of the Italian Insolvency Code. ----- The court, upon the entrepreneur's request and to the extent that this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the maximization of the creditors' recovery, may authorize: (a) the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new super-senior indebtedness (so called ""prededucibile"") pursuant to Article 22, paragraph 1, lett. a) and lett. c) of the Italian Insolvency Code; (b) the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior indebtedness (prededucibile) via shareholders' financing pursuant to Article 22, paragraph 1, lett. b) of the Italian Insolvency Code; (c) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided under Article 2560, paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code, pursuant to Article 22, paragraph 1, lett. d) of the Italian Insolvency Code. However, in such case it will be for the court itself to identify the measures it considers appropriate, taking into account the requests of the parties concerned, in order to protect the interests of all relevant parties involved. The composizione negoziata della crisi can terminate as follows: (a) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which constitutes cause for application of special the reward measures provided if, according to the Expert's Final Report, such agreement ensures the continuation of the business as a going concern for at least 2 years; (b) execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 62 of the Italian Insolvency Code; (c) execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert, with the effects provided under Article 166, paragraph 3, letter d), and 324 of the Italian Insolvency Code. In such case, the independent expert's report (attestazione) shall not be required. At the end of the negotiations, the entrepreneur can also file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti). Alternatively, the entrepreneur may: (a) arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento); (b) file a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio; (c) enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Insolvency Code or in the so-called Prodi-bis procedure or Marzano procedure, should the requirements provided for by law be met. Potential outcomes: concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio (introduced by Law Decree 118/2021) The Italian Insolvency Code provides for a streamlined court-supervised composition with creditors with liquidation purpose (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio). If, in its Final Report, the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome but have been conducted according to fairness and in good faith, and that the options provided under Article 23 of the Italian Insolvency Code are not feasible, within 60 days following the notification of the Final Report the entrepreneur may file, with the competent court of the place where the company has its registered office, a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a liquidation plan and the documents listed under Article 39 of the Italian Insolvency Code, which may divide the creditors into various classes. The petition for _concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del _patrimonio is then published in the companies' register within the day following the filing with the court._ From the date of such publication, the effects provided under Articles 6, 46, 94 and 96 apply. The court issues a decree of approval (omologazione) the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del _patrimonio when it finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with relevant laws and_ regulations and the adversarial principle among the parties (contraddittorio); (ii) the proposal is compliant ----- with rules governing claim ranking (cause di prelazione) and the liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii) the proposal does not cause a prejudice to the creditors compared to what they would receive in case of insolvent liquidation of the entrepreneur, and in any case ensures that each creditor receives a certain recovery. The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the above-mentioned decree within 30 days after having been notified of the same.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The court appoints a ----- bankruptcy receiver (curateur). The receiver will under the supervision of the court manage the bankruptcy (which effectively means to liquidate its assets and pay off creditors) without having to consult with the managers. The main effect of bankruptcy proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the Luxembourg Company, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for secured creditors, and the payment of creditors in accordance with their rank upon the realisation of assets. In principle, contracts of the bankrupt company are not automatically terminated on commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, save for contracts for which the identity or solvency of the company was crucial (intuitu personae agreements). However, certain contracts are terminated automatically by law (such as employment contracts) unless expressly confirmed by the receiver. The receiver may choose to terminate contracts of the company subject to the rule of ""exceptio non adimpleti contractus"" and the creditors' interest. However, as of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate. Unsecured claims will only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and certain preferential debts. During bankruptcy proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended, save as provided for in the Luxembourg Act of 5 August 2005 on financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the ""Luxembourg Collateral Act""). Save with respect to financial collateral arrangements falling within the scope of the Luxembourg Collateral Act, Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Luxembourg Company s during the pre-bankruptcy hardening period (période suspecte) which is a period of a maximum of six months preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy (and up to 10 days before the beginning of such period for certain transactions and payments), except that in certain specific situations the commercial district court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date. Fraudulent transactions may be set aside without consideration of the date they have been entered into. In particular: (a) pursuant to Article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, some transactions (in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts (save with respect to financial collateral arrangements falling within the scope of the Luxembourg Collateral Act)); the payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, setoff or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange (unless, arguably, that method of payment was agreed from inception), transactions without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration entered into during the suspect period (or the ten days preceding it)) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the bankruptcy receiver. Article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Conduct does not apply to financial collateral arrangements such as Luxembourg law pledges over shares, accounts or receivables and set-off arrangements falling within the scope of the Luxembourg Collateral Act; (b) pursuant to Article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the suspect period are subject to cancellation or setting aside by the commercial district court upon proceedings initiated by the bankruptcy receiver, if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt's cessation of payments, Article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce does not apply for financial collateral arrangements, such as Luxembourg law pledges over shares, accounts or receivables and set-off arrangements falling within the scope of the Luxembourg Collateral Act; (c) pursuant to Article 447 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge and initiate nullity actions against mortgages and privileges that have been granted either ten days prior to or after the date of the cessation of payments if more than 15 days have elapsed between the granting of the mortgage or privilege and its registration. Article 447 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce does not apply to financial collateral arrangements, such as Luxembourg law pledges over shares, accounts or receivables and set-off arrangements falling within the scope of the Luxembourg Collateral Act; and (d) Pursuant to Article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and Article 1167 of the Luxembourg Civil Code (action paulienne), the bankruptcy receiver (acting on behalf of the ----- creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The suspension of payment regime (sursis de paiement) was intended to be abolished by the LBCA however, arguably due to a legislative error, this was not fully achieved. In light of the limited practical relevance of this regime, it is not further described. A debtor may also enter into negotiations with creditors (at least two creditors) with a view to reaching an amicable agreement (accord amiable) pursuant to the LBCA. Once an amicable agreement has been reached, the debtor may apply to the court to obtain a certification (homologation) of the amicable agreement. The court will assess whether or not the purpose of the amicable agreement is to reorganise (all or part of) the debtor's assets or activities to grant the certification which will render the amicable agreement enforceable (exécutoire). The amicable agreement can only be disclosed to third parties if the debtor has given its express consent. The liability of the creditors participating in an amicable agreement cannot be pursued by the debtor, another creditor or by third parties for the sole reason that the agreement has not effectively preserved the continuity of all or part of the debtor's business. ----- The Luxembourg Company may also be subject to preventive measures with a view to detecting financial difficulties of undertakings at an early stage and facilitating business preservation and reorganization pursuant to the LBCA. In particular, the minister of the economy and the minister of middle classes are tasked, within their respective competences, with detecting companies in financial difficulties. A company which finds itself in financial difficulties may ask the relevant minister to appoint a business conciliator from a list of experts in the field, to facilitate the reorganization of all or part of the assets of the company or its activities. It can be appointed outside or, in the context of a judicial reorganization procedure. The role of the conciliator will be different than the role of the bankruptcy receiver during bankruptcy proceedings. As such, the conciliator does not have any decision-making power over the company and his main role will be to take part in negotiations to facilitate the reaching of agreements. The role of the conciliator ends at the request of the debtor or by the conciliator itself. A court appointed expert (mandataire de justice) may be appointed by the commercial district court in case of gross and qualified failures (manquements graves et caractérisées) of the debtor or any of its corporate bodies, which threaten the continuity of the business of the company and if the requested measure is intended to preserve such continuity. The appointment will be made at the request of the public prosecutor or any interested party (including the debtor). In addition to these proceedings, the ability of creditors to receive payments due to them by a Luxembourg Company incorporated or established in Luxembourg may be affected by a decision of the commercial district court (Tribunal d'arrondissement siégeant en matière commerciale) putting the relevant Luxembourg Company into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Although strictly speaking not an insolvency proceeding, judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the State Prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the Luxembourg code of commerce or of the Luxembourg act of 10 August 1915 on commercial companies, as amended. The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable to Luxembourg bankruptcy proceedings. In addition to these Luxembourg Insolvency Proceedings and although strictly speaking not an insolvency proceeding, a Luxembourg Company may be subject to voluntary dissolution or liquidation (dissolution ou _liquidation volontaire) and administrative dissolution without liquidation (dissolution administrative sans liquidation)._",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The purpose of the judicial reorganization proceeding is to preserve, under the supervision of a judge, the continuity of all or part of the assets or activities of a debtor. Judicial reorganization proceedings constitute judicial proceedings aiming to avoid bankruptcy and preserve a Luxembourg Company's business. The opening of judicial reorganization proceedings aims either: (a) at obtaining a stay (sursis) to allow the conclusion of an amicable agreement (accord amiable); (b) at carrying out a judicial reorganization by collective agreement (réorganisation judiciaire par _accord collectif); or_ (c) at carrying out a judicial reorganization by transfer by court order to one or several third parties, of all or part of the assets or the activities (réorganisation par transfert par décision de justice). The application for a judicial reorganization procedure may pursue a separate objective for each activity or any part of the business of the Luxembourg Company. As soon as the application is filed by a Luxembourg Company, the presiding judge of the chamber of the court appoints a delegated judge (juge délégué) to report to the court seized of the case on the admissibility and the basis of the application based on the hearing of the Luxembourg Company, as well as any other person considered useful to the investigation. Within fifteen days of the filing of the application for judicial reorganization it must be examined by the court and the debtor is summoned to a hearing. After hearing the report of the delegated judge and if the opening conditions are met, the court delivers its judgment within eight days of the hearing. The state of bankruptcy of the debtor does not prevent the opening of the judicial reorganization proceedings if this is more advantageous than bankruptcy proceedings. If the conditions seem to be fulfilled, the court will declare the opening of the judicial reorganization procedure and will declare a stay on payment. It will determine the duration of the stay/suspension of payments which cannot exceed four months. The duration may be extended but without exceeding 12 months after the judgement opening the judicial reorganization procedure in case the request is filed in the context of a transfer by decision of justice to one or several third parties, of all or part of the assets or the activities. In exceptional circumstances (taking into account the size of the business and the complexity of the matter or the importance of the jobs) and if the interests of the creditors allow so, the 12month period may be extended by another 6 months. The total duration of the stay may however not exceed 12 months as from the judgement ordering the stay. Within fourteen days of its pronouncement, the Luxembourg Company Luxembourg Company must individually notify the creditors of the opening judgment. Creditors may consult the list of creditors at the court registry. A legal representative (mandataire de justice) can be appointed to assist at the request of the debtor or any third party having an interest in doing so. If a business conciliator was previously appointed, the court can decide to terminate part or all of the mission of the business conciliator (conciliateur d'entreprise). In case of gross and qualified failure of the debtor or one of its bodies, the court may appoint a temporary administrator (administrateur provisoire) at the request of any interested party or the public prosecutor.

The obligation to declare bankruptcy is also suspended during this period. During the duration of the stay, the creditors can no longer enforce their rights against the debtor in relation to the ""stayed"" claims (créances sursitaires) and no attachment may be made. ""Stayed"" claims are claims other than claims for the payment of salaries due before the judgment opening the judicial reorganization procedure or due by reason of the filing of the writ for the opening of the judicial reorganization procedure or the decisions taken in the context of the judicial reorganization procedure. In addition, no realisation of any movable or immovable property of the debtor can take place following the exercise of any enforcement measure (voies d'exécution) (subject to certain exceptions). However, this shall not affect the realisation of financial collateral arrangements falling within the scope of the Luxembourg Collateral Act and these will continue to be effective and enforceable (opposables) security interests. The judicial reorganization measures do however impact the right to terminate certain contracts to which the debtor is a party. In particular (a) the application for or the opening of a judicial reorganization procedure will not cause the termination of ongoing contracts of the debtor, (b) any breach by the debtor of its contractual obligations prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization measure permits other party to terminate the agreement only if the debtor does remedy such default within 15 days of a demand to do so and (c) a debtor, following the opening of a judicial reorganization procedure, may unilaterally suspend its contractual obligations during the period of the suspension of payments if this is imperatively required for the reorganization of its business and to notify the counterparty accordingly. In such an event, the contractual counterparty can also suspend the performance of its obligations, but the decision of the debtor does not permit the contractual counterparty to terminate the agreement. Whilst these provisions do not impact the validity and the enforceability of any financial collateral agreements as such, there is a risk that, if a court was to decide that they apply to financing agreements, they could impact the timing of an enforcement of any financial collateral arrangements entered into by the debtor (in particular if their enforcement requires an acceleration of the secured liabilities). The stay does not prohibit voluntary payments by the Luxembourg Company of ""stayed"" claims, insofar as this payment is necessary for the continuity of such Luxembourg Company's business. Without prejudice to the application of the Luxembourg Collateral Act and in particular the rules on set-off and netting provided therein, set-off between outstanding claims and claims arising during the suspension is only permitted if these claims are related (créances connexes). The stay does not, in principle, terminate on-going contracts or the terms and conditions of their performance. Penalty clauses, including interest rate surcharges, intended to cover potential damage suffered as a result of non-compliance with a principal undertaking remain, in principle, ineffective during the stay and until the full implementation of the reorganization plan, as far as the creditors included in the plan are concerned. The creditor may, however, include the actual loss suffered as a result of non-compliance with the main undertaking in its claim. It will also be possible to modify, at the request of the debtor, the objective of the procedure at any time during the period of the stay.

Moreover, the reorganization plan may, without limitation also provide other matters such as: (a) the conversion of claims into shares; (b) waivers of interest or rescheduling of the payment of such interests; (c) that the outstanding claims may not be offset against claims of the creditor (holder) subsequent to the certification, except in the case of related claims (créances connexes) or claims which may be offset under an agreement prior to the opening of the procedure; (d) the suspension of the exercise of the existing rights of extraordinary outstanding creditors for a period not exceeding twenty-four months from the date of the certification judgment, without prejudice to the payment of interest which is contractually or legally due to them on their claims; (e) provide for the voluntary transfer of all or part of the debtor or its activities. The implementation period of the plan may not exceed five years from its certification. The debtor may request to be assisted by a court officer (mandataire de justice) for the drafting of this plan. The court clerk will communicate the day and time of the hearing at which the plan will be voted. This communication will indicate that the creditors will be able to present their observations at the hearing either in writing or orally and that only ordinary and extraordinary outstanding creditors whose rights are affected by the plan will be able to vote. The approval of the reorganization plan results from a favorable vote of (a) the majority of the creditors in each class, (b) representing by their uncontested or provisionally admitted claims half of all the amounts due in principal. The creditors and claims included in the list of creditors filed by the Luxembourg ----- Company, as well as creditors whose claims have provisionally been admitted will be considered for calculating the required majority. The reorganization plan must be implemented within five years of its certification. The full implementation (exécution) of the plan fully discharges the Luxembourg Company s for all the claims contained therein. If the Luxembourg Company is manifestly no longer able to execute the plan and as a result thereof the relevant creditor suffers prejudice therefrom, a creditor may request the revocation of the reorganization plan. In case of bankruptcy adjudication of the Luxembourg Company the reorganization plan is automatically terminated.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Article 20 of the Luxembourg Collateral Act expressly provides that financial collateral arrangements governed by or falling within the scope of the Luxembourg Collateral Act including enforcement measures are valid and enforceable even if entered into during the hardening period, against third parties including supervisors, receivers, liquidators and any other similar persons or bodies irrespective of any bankruptcy, liquidation or other situation, national or foreign, of composition with creditors or reorganization affecting any one of the parties (save in case of fraud). Article 24 of the Luxembourg Collateral Act provides that foreign law security interests over claims or financial instruments granted by a Luxembourg company will be valid and enforceable as a matter of Luxembourg law notwithstanding any Luxembourg Insolvency Proceedings, if such foreign law security interests are similar in nature to a Luxembourg security interest falling within the scope of the Luxembourg Collateral Act and even if entered into during the hardening period (save in case of fraud). Article 21(2) of the Luxembourg Collateral Act provides that where a financial collateral arrangement has been entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures, such arrangement is enforceable against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar organs if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of it. _Limitation on enforcement of security interests_ According to Luxembourg conflict of laws rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex rei _sitae or lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or security interest is_ situated) in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets. As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/claims governed by Luxembourg law and/or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities which are held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc. If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Luxembourg law. The Luxembourg Collateral Act governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over, among others: (a) shares in private limited liability companies; (b) bank accounts; and (c) receivables located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, granted to secure financial obligations. Under the Luxembourg Collateral Act, the perfection of security interests depends on certain registration, notification and acceptance requirements. ----- Article 11 of the Luxembourg Collateral Act sets out enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event, including, but not limited to: (a) appropriate the pledged assets or have the pledged assets appropriated by a third party at a price determined before or after their appropriation by the agreed upon valuation method; (b) selling or causing the sale of the pledged assets: (i) in a private transaction (vente de gré à gré) at normal commercial terms (conditions commerciales normales); (ii) on a trading venue on which the pledged assets are admitted to trading or (ii) by public auction; (c) court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; (d) request the redemption of the pledged units or shares of an undertaking for collective investment at the redemption price in accordance with the instruments of incorporation of this undertaking for collective investment; (e) exercise all the rights arising under the pledged insurance contract, including, in the case of a life insurance contract or a capital redemption operation, the right to surrender, or request the insurance undertaking to pay any sums due pursuant to the insurance contract or set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets; As the Luxembourg Collateral Act does not provide any specific time periods and depending on: (a) the method chosen; (b) the valuation of the pledged assets; (c) any possible recourses; and (d) the possible need to involve third parties, such as, for example, courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests might be substantially delayed. Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security Interests/arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers/administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, even over assets located outside of Luxembourg, in particular where a Luxembourg Company becomes subject to insolvency proceedings in Luxembourg or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets. The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to pledge agreements does not prevent any thirdparty creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law). While pledges over Luxembourg located accounts created under Luxembourg law governed account pledge agreements are, in accordance with Article 20(1) of the Luxembourg Collateral Act, valid and binding against third parties, administrators, bankruptcy receivers, liquidators and other similar officers notwithstanding the existence of reorganization measures, liquidation proceedings or the occurrence of any other similar situation of competition between creditors, national or foreign, there is a risk that such protection does not apply to monies or other assets transferred to relevant accounts after the occurrence of any Luxembourg Insolvency Proceedings. Therefore, there is a risk that monies or other assets transferred to such account after the occurrence of Luxembourg Insolvency Proceedings may not effectively constitute enforceable security assets under the relevant account pledge agreement. Under Luxembourg law, certain creditors of an insolvent party have rights to preferred payments arising by operation of law, some of which may, under certain circumstances, supersede the rights to payment of secured or unsecured creditors, and most of which are undisclosed preferences (privilèges occultes). This includes in particular the rights relating to fees and costs of the insolvency official as well as any legal costs, the rights of employees to certain amounts of salary, and the rights of the Treasury and certain assimilated parties (namely social security bodies), which preferences may extend to all or part of the assets of the insolvent party. This general privilege takes in principle precedence over the privilege of a pledgee in respect of pledged assets governed by the Luxembourg Collateral Act. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

In particular, according to article 1500-11 of the Luxembourg Law on Commercial Companies, it is a criminal offence for managers or directors of a company to use the assets or the credit of a company for a purpose which they know to be against the interest of the company in their personal interest, or in the interest of companies in which they are directly or indirectly interested. The granting of a guarantee or of a security interest in violation of article 1500-11 of the Luxembourg Law on Commercial Companies would constitute a criminal offence committed by the managers/directors of the company but there is also a risk that the guarantee/the security interest could be considered to be null and void. A company may hence, in principle, not encumber its assets or provide guarantees in favor of group companies in general (at least as far as parent companies and fellow subsidiaries of its parent companies are concerned). In this respect it should be noted that there is no Luxembourg legislation governing group companies which specifically regulates the establishment, organization and liability of groups of companies. Consequently, the concept of group interest as opposed to the interest of the individual corporate entity is not expressly recognised. However, based on relevant French and Belgian case law and legal literature (to which Luxembourg courts are likely to refer in this context), the view can be taken that a Luxembourg company may, in principle, validly assist other group companies if: (a) the transaction in the context of which the guarantee is granted is entered into with a view to furthering economic, social or financial interests within the framework of a common policy defined for the group as a whole; (b) it can be established that the company derives a benefit from granting such financial commitments or that at least, there is no disruption of the balance of interests in the group to the detriment of the Luxembourg company; and (c) the financial commitments is not in terms of the amounts involved disproportionate to the company's financial means and the benefits derived from granting such assistance. If the assistance is deemed contrary to the interest of the company by the courts, its directors may be held liable for action taken in that context. To mitigate the above risks, it is market practice in Luxembourg to limit personal guarantees, but not in rem_ security, granted by Luxembourg Company s to third parties to secure the obligations of parent companies and fellow subsidiaries of their parent companies. The question whether there is sufficient corporate benefit for a company to grant a guarantee is very fact based and is to be assessed by the managers/directors of the relevant company. However, it is generally considered that a guarantee provided for the obligations of a direct or indirect subsidiary, a so called ""downstream guarantee,"" does not raise any particular concern and is in the direct interest of the guarantor, whereas a guarantee provided for the obligations of a direct or indirect parent or sister company, a so called ""upstream"" or ""cross-stream guarantee"" respectively, are less likely to be in the direct interest of the guarantor and therefore, such ""upstream"" or ""cross-stream guarantee"" are generally limited, such limitation generally taking the form of a guarantee limitation language.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The Republic of Austria and the United States currently do not have a treaty that provides for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments rendered in either country's courts, other than arbitration awards in civil and commercial matters. There is currently also no applicable ordinance of the Austrian government in place. As a consequence, a judgment obtained in a court of the United States, be it a judgment rendered by a U.S. federal or state court, will not be recognized and enforced in Austria and, for purposes of enforcement in Austria, would have to be re-litigated in Austrian courts in accordance with applicable Austrian civil procedure laws (Zivilprozessverfahren, ZPO). Enforcement procedures under the Austrian Enforcement Act can only be initiated once a final judgment has been obtained in an Austrian court.

In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Belgium, formal exequatur proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in Belgium.

Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or directly enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, fresh proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, an English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (summary judgment is a procedure by which the English court can dispose of all or part of a claim without proceeding to trial). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles and rules of English private international law (in other words, whether the U.S. court had jurisdiction according to the rules of English private international law) at the time when the original proceedings were initiated; - the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause, or in breach of an agreement for the settlement of disputes under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in a U.S. court (except with the agreement of the relevant parties or the relevant parties' subsequent submission to the jurisdiction of the court); - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; ----- - the recognition or enforcement of the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy, the European Convention on Human Rights or English law including the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the extent applicable); - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English penal, revenue or other public law; - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damage sustained, and not being otherwise in breach of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980; - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural justice; - there not having been a prior inconsistent, determinative or conflicting judgment of an English court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties, and/or prior inconsistent judgment given by any other court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England and Wales; - the U.S. judgment not having been wholly satisfied, or not being enforceable by execution solely in the United States; - the party seeking enforcement providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English court; and - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date the U.S. judgment became enforceable. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized and/or enforceable in England and Wales. In addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in England and Wales in an original action in respect of a U.S. judgment predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws or other laws. Further, it may not be possible to obtain a judgment in England and Wales or to enforce the judgment if the judgment debtor is or becomes subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, if the judgment debtor has any set off or counterclaim against the judgment creditor, or if an appeal is pending or anticipated against the judgment or against the foreign judgment. Finally, note that, in any proceedings in England and Wales to enforce a U.S. judgment, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England and Wales, unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.4,France,23.4.1,,"The Group's counsel advised that the United States and France are not party to a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, final and enforceable judgments rendered by U.S. courts based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, enforceable in the United States, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgement was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal judiciaire). Under prevailing French case law, enforcement in France of such U.S. judgement could be obtained following proper (i.e., non-ex parte) proceedings, if the French civil court is satisfied that the following formal conditions have been met (which conditions do not include a review by the French courts of the merits of the foreign judgement): - Such U.S. judgement is enforceable in the jurisdiction of the court which rendered it; - Such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court, the choice of the U.S. court is not fraudulent and French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction to hear the matter; ----- - Such U.S. judgement does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the merits and the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and - Such U.S. judgement is not tainted with fraud. The French civil court would also verify that the U.S. judgement does not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment which is vested with res judicata and enforceable in France and there is no risk of conflict with proceedings before French courts at the time enforcement of the judgement is sought (in this latter case, exequatur proceedings may be stayed). The French civil court's assessment of these conditions is discretionary. If any of these conditions is not fulfilled, the U.S. judgment cannot be recognized or enforced in France. If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the _res judicata in France as of the date of the decision of the French civil court (or exceptionally of the date_ of the U.S. judgment if it requires so to be effective). Please note that the decision granting exequatur may be appealed. As a general principle, procedural rules are governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the court (lex fori). The party initiating exequatur in relation to a U.S. judgement in France would have to provide the French civil court: (i) a certified copy of the U.S. judgement, as well as a French translation thereof, and (ii) any document demonstrating that, according to the applicable U.S. law, the judgement is enforceable and has been notified to the defendant. Upon ruling on the exequatur request, the French civil court is also competent to rule on court costs and fees. The party requesting the enforcement usually bears the costs of the exequatur proceedings. The party requesting exequatur who benefited from legal aid in the U.S. proceedings on the merits does not automatically benefit from such aid in front of the French civil court. However, this does not prohibit the party seeking exequatur from requesting legal aid under the applicable French law (i.e., law n° 91-647 of July 10, 1991 relating to legal aid). In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 relating to the communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities (loi de blocage), French Order No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (adapting the value in euros of certain amounts expressed in francs in legislative texts), decree No. 2022-207 of February 18, 2022 and bylaw of the Ministry of Economy of March 7, 2022 (relating to communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons) as well as French law No. 2018-670 related to the protection of trade secrets, which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons. Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78 17 of 6 January 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as modified, as well as Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context. Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene (i) French international public policy or (ii) overriding mandatory rules (as determined on a case by case basis by French courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought. Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted ----- by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with a French person. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant. For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts' jurisdiction over French nationals is no longer mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. It also rules that these provisions are not a matter of public order and must, in order to be applicable in a specific matter, be raised by the claimant. In addition, a French national may waive its rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by a jurisdiction provision in a contract or by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court. It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012, as regards legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person domiciled in an EU Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant's nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the European Union. Moreover, several decisions of the civil chamber of the French High Court (Cour de cassation) dated September 26, 2012, March 25, 2015 and October 7, 2015, February 7, 2018, October 3, 2018 and July 11, 2019 permit to conclude – despite a contrary decision of the commercial chamber of the French High Court (chambre commerciale de la Cour de Cassation) issued on May 11, 2017 – that contractual provisions submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party an additional option to choose another jurisdiction (one-sided jurisdiction clauses) may only be effective if they set out an objective basis for the alternative jurisdictions that one party could choose. Accordingly, any one-sided jurisdiction clauses which do not set out an objective basis (as a reference to a ground of jurisdiction or to legal rules) in any relevant documents would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts. These decisions were issued on the basis of the Brussels I and I recast Regulations or on the basis of the Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters signed in Lugano on October 30, 2007 and have yet to be confirmed in cases that fall outside this scope.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.5,Germany,23.5.1,,"There is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgement obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgements, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgement for payment given by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgement by a U.S. court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgements if any of the reasons for excluding enforceability set forth in Sections 723(2), 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung) exist: - if the judgment is not final under U.S. law - if, pursuant to German law, the courts in the country of the court having rendered the foreign judgement did not have jurisdiction; - if process has not been duly served or has not been served in a timely fashion to permit a defense, provided that the defendant did not actively participate in such process and pleads accordingly; ----- - if the judgement is incompatible with a prior judgement rendered by a German court or by a foreign court which is to be recognized in Germany; - if the proceeding resulting in the judgement to be recognized is incompatible with a previously pending (rechtshängig) proceeding in Germany; - if a recognition of the judgement would be obviously incompatible with fundamental principles of German law (ordre public), in particular, if the recognition would be incompatible with the civil rights under the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and if reciprocity is not ensured (i.e., the courts of the country where the judgement was issued would not recognize and enforce a comparable judgement by a German court in equivalent circumstances). Subject to the foregoing, holders of the Notes may be able to enforce judgements in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. courts in Germany. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgements in Germany will be successful. In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages are usually denied by German courts as incompatible with the substantial foundations of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Consequently, judgements awarding monetary damages under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws may not be enforceable to the extent they provide for a compensation that would qualify as being of a penal or punitive nature. German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In so far as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and/or the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law. If the party in whose favor the final U.S. federal or state judgement is rendered brings a new lawsuit in the same matter in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German courts the final judgement rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgement by a U.S. federal or state court will be regarded by the German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgement relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgement that is not in line with the judgement rendered by the U.S. federal or state court, but the latitude to deviate from the foreign judgment is limited. The German court is free to issue a completely new decision if there are grounds for non-recognition under 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure, but must otherwise take the foreign decision into account (i.e., the foreign judgement has a certain binding effect). Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting rights of creditors generally.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.6,Italy,23.6.1,,"The United States and Italy currently do not have a bilateral treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Notwithstanding the above, recognition and enforcement in Italy of a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, does not require re-examination of the merit of the case and will be enforceable in Italy, provided that, pursuant to Article 64 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995, among others, the following conditions are met: (a) the U.S. court which rendered the final judgment had jurisdiction upon the relevant matter according to Italian law principles of jurisdiction; (b) the relevant summons and complaint were appropriately served on the defendants in accordance with U.S. law and during the proceedings the essential rights of defense of the defendants have not been violated; (c) the judgment is final and not subject to any further appeal in accordance with U.S. law; ----- (d) the parties to the proceeding appeared before the court in accordance with U.S. law or, in the event of default by the defendants, the U.S. court declared such default in accordance with U.S. law; (e) the U.S. judgment is not in conflict with any final judgment previously rendered by an Italian court; (f) there is no action pending in the Republic of Italy among the same parties and on the same claim which commenced prior to the action in the United States; and (g) the provisions of such judgment would not violate Italian public policy. In addition, pursuant to Article 67 of Italian law No. 218 of May 31, 1995, in cases of non-compliance with or objection to the recognition of a U.S. judgment, or when it is necessary to proceed with forceful execution, any interested person may apply to the Court of Appeal of the location of implementation for a determination of the existence of the recognition prerequisites above. The U.S. judgment, jointly with the decision allowing the application referred to above, constitutes entitlement to the implementation and forceful execution. If the objection to the U.S. judgment is raised in the context of other proceedings pending in Italy, the decision on the objection is made by the Italian judge with effects limited to those proceedings only. If an original action is brought before an Italian court in order to enforce the rights arising from the Notes and/or the Indenture, the Italian court may refuse to apply U.S. law provisions or to grant some of the remedies sought pursuant to U.S. law (e.g., punitive damages) if their application violates Italian public policy and mandatory provisions of Italian law. Moreover, in original actions brought before Italian courts, there is doubt as to the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based solely on the U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, in original actions brought before Italian courts, Italian courts may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of Italian law that are regarded as mandatory.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.7,Grand Duchy of Luxembourg,23.7.1,Enforcement of Judgments,"As there is currently no treaty in force governing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters between the United States and Luxembourg, courts in Luxembourg will not automatically recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. A valid final, non-appealable and conclusive judgment against an issuer or a guarantor incorporated in Luxembourg with respect to the guarantee of the Notes or guarantee thereof obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States would be recognized and enforced by the courts of Luxembourg in accordance with general provisions of Luxembourg procedural law. Pursuant to such rules, a foreign law judgment would not be directly enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who obtains a valid, nonappealable and conclusive U.S. law judgment may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exequatur), by requesting the enforcement of such U.S. law judgment from the District Court (Tribunal _d'Arrondissement), pursuant to Section 678 of the Luxembourg New Code of Civil Procedure (Nouveau Code de Procédure Civile). The District Court will authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg of the U.S._ law judgment without re-examination of the merits, if it is satisfied that the following conditions are met: - the judgment rendered by the U.S. court is enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States; - the assumption of personal and subject-matter jurisdiction (compétence) of the U.S. court and the choice of venue is founded according to both such U.S. court's law and Luxembourg private international law rules; - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural rules and has applied to the dispute the substantive law which would have been applied by Luxembourg courts; - the principles of fair trial and due process have been complied with and in particular the judgment was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity to appear, and if appeared, to present its case; and - the judgment rendered by the U.S. court does not contravene Luxembourg public policy and has not been obtained fraudulently. ----- If an original action is brought in Luxembourg, without prejudice to specific conflict of law rules, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of such foreign law was not made in good faith (bona fide), or (ii) if the foreign law was not pleaded and proved, or (iii) if pleaded and proved, such foreign law was contrary to mandatory Luxembourg laws or incompatible with Luxembourg public policy rules. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an exequatur may be refused in respect of a foreign judgment granting punitive damages. Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have power to give a judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than euro. However, enforcement of the judgment against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would be converted into euro. Luxembourg case law is constantly evolving. Some of the above conditions of admissibility may change and additional conditions could be required to be fulfilled by Luxembourg courts while other conditions may not be required by Luxembourg courts in the future. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different cash generating units were disclosed in the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022. The Group considers the relationship between its market capitalisation and its book value, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment. As at 30 September 2023, the market capitalisation of the Group was below the book value of its equity, indicating a potential impairment of goodwill. As a result, management performed an impairment test as at 30 September 2023 for the cash generating units or groups of cash-generating units of the SYNLAB Group. The CGUs and group of CGUs as at 30 September 2023 are consistent with the ones for the year ended 31 December 2022. The carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each CGUs and group of CGUs and key assumptions of the impairment testing model, in addition to adjusted EBITDA, are as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

A 5% decrease in the forecasted adjusted EBITDA (AEBITDA) over the forecast’s horizon (2023 – 2027) included in the terminal value would lead to a goodwill impairment for Germany, France and South where it would lead to an impairment of 75M€, 1M€ and 33M€ being recognized respectively. A decrease of 1% point in long-term growth rate would lead to a goodwill impairment for Germany, France and South where it would lead to impairment of 92M€, 48M€ and 36M€ being recognized respectively. ----- #### 12.

504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,2862,TRANSLATION,2862.5,1. Requirement for estimates in connection with the determination and cut-off of realised revenue in Germany,2862.5.1,,"a) The Group generates revenue with a wide range of clinical laboratory and medical diagnostic services for insurance companies, hospitals, individuals, pharmacies and national health organisations. These services are primarily provided in the area of human medicine but also in the area of veterinary medicine. On the one hand, the agreed accounting modalities are based on the respective country-specific conditions for publicly regulated healthcare systems as well as on individual agreements concluded with any natural person or legal entity outside of the publicly regulated healthcare system on the other hand. The accounting processes resulting from the complex accounting laws – particularly in Germany – require estimates be made to a significant extent at the end of the financial year when determining and cutting-off realised revenue. In Germany, significant revenue estimates are necessary in the following areas: i) Realisation of revenue in connection with tests performed but not yet finally billed. These revenues are subject to risks regarding their measurement as assumptions on the determination of average prices are to be made. When budgets are agreed upon, assumptions for forecasts for the budgeted period have to be calculated additionally due to regular pricing depending on the volume. Moreover, when dealing with regulated prices, assumptions on the consideration of billing restrictions need to be considered. These estimates are particularly complex, especially in the German part of the Group, due to the multitude of existing regulations. ii) Revenue and/or quotes for services, respectively, that are billed via the public health insurance’s system depend on doctors’ performance requirements in connection with set budgets public health insurance companies have in due consideration of the according restriction instruments, which are only determined well after the service has been rendered. The estimate is made considering historic information and values as well as current expectations the executive directors have. The Group revenue for the financial year 2022 ) includes cut-off revenue of mEUR 189.6 (prior year: mEUR 235.7). Based on the estimate, the revenue share in Germany amounts to mEUR 128.2 (prior year: mEUR 178.8). This matter constitutes a key audit matter from our point of view, as a large extent of judgement is necessary regarding the executive directors’ estimates and the results of these estimates are significant for the financial statements overall. In light of the existing discretionary scopes and due to the complexity of the determining methods and models, which served as basis, this matter was of particular importance during our audit. Information provided by the parent company’s executive directors on material estimates when determining and cutting off of revenue are included in sections 2.6.2 and 3 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. b) We tested the design and implementation of accounting-related internal controls and the general IT controls from selected laboratory information, billing and accounting systems as well as regarding estimated revenues. In addition, we developed an understanding of the relevant methods, assumptions and data sources used by the executive directors regarding the estimated revenues. In order to assess the quality of the estimates in the past, we have conducted retrospective analyses while critically assessing deviations. In so doing, we conducted ----- SYNLAB AG ### Independent auditors report to the members of Synlab AG the following audit procedures all the while maintaining “professional judgement: Validation with average prices, that we have ascertained ourselves from the billed population, plausibility checks based on historic information and on external market data, regulations and agreements as well as understanding the executive directors’ billing method.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,2862,TRANSLATION,2862.6,2. Recoverability of goodwill,2862.6.1,,"a) As at 31 December 2022, the Group reports goodwill of m EUR 2,323 (2021: mEUR 2,440) in total, which overall includes four cash-generating-units (“CGU”) and groups of CGUs, respectively. As at 31 December 2022, the executive directors of the parent company carried out impairment tests of goodwill in compliance with IAS 36 (impairment of assets), by means of a detailed measurement of the value in use of the CGUs and CGU groups, respectively, by using the discounted cash flow model. The determination of the value in use is based on the planning of SYNLAB AG’s executive directors, which consists of a three-year plan (budget for 2023 and strategic medium-term planning 2024 to 2025) as well as a projection for two more years, which is continued with assumptions on long-term growth rates. This planning was updated in December based on current events. The budget and the medium-term planning are approved by the supervisory board and the executive board, respectively. In the context of the impairment test, even after taking into account the fair value less costs to sell of the cash generating unit Germany, the executive directors arrived at an impairment of mEUR 213.0 in total. The result of the impairment tests highly depends on the executive directors’ assessment of future cash inflows to the respective CGUs and CGU groups as well as from the used discount rate (weighted average cost of capital) and hence is subject to significant uncertainty. This issue was of particular importance within the scope of our audit in light of the existing uncertainties and discretionary scope and due to the complexity of the measurement model the measurement was based on. Information provided by the executive directors of the parent company on the recoverability of goodwill as well as their impairment tests are included in sections 2.6.2 and 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. b) First of all, we developed an understanding of the relevant methods the executive directors applied as well as of the assumptions and data sources used relating to the measurement of goodwill. This also included the manner and ways of ascertaining the planning figures for future cash inflows as well as ascertaining the discount rates. According to our audit strategy we have conducted scaled audit procedures in accordance with our risk assessment. Our risk assessment was primarily based on headroom and sensitivity analyses. Our audit procedures, which were conducted step-by-step, are described below. When conducting the impairment tests, we integrated internal measurement specialists into our audit team. With their help, we audited whether the essential parameters used during the calculations such as for example the used discount rates and sustainable growth rates in the perpetual pension as well as the planned cash inflows were appropriate, by comparing these values with the multi-year budget figures for 2023 to 2027 adopted by the executive directors as well as by checking the plausibility of the measurement assumptions made based on general and industry-specific market forecasts and expectations as well as publicly available forecasts from financial analysts regarding SYNLAB ----- SYNLAB AG ### Independent auditors report to the members of Synlab AG AG. Apart from that, we examined the accuracy of the forecasts over time. We scrutinised the planned revenues using internal evidence and provided information as well as publicly available external market assessments all the while considering internal and publicly available external sources regarding their assessment on the development of the coronavirus pandemic and its economic impact. In addition, we examined the allocation of corporate assets and corporate costs to the CGUs and CGU groups, respectively. Considering that even relatively small changes of the discount rate may have a significant impact on the determined amount of the Company’s value, we also made the parameters used to determine each discount rate (WACC) including the resulting weighted average cost of capital (WACC) plausible based on own control and comparison calculations, respectively. Finally, we examined the information provided by the executive directors in the notes to the consolidated financial statements regarding the measurement of goodwill as well as the information provided on the impairment tests with regard to their completeness and compliance with the requirements of IAS 36.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,2862,TRANSLATION,2862.7,3. Valuation of the provision for risks from antitrust proceedings,2862.7.1,,"a) In December 2022, SYNLAB Group received the statement of objections under current antitrust proceedings from the Portuguese antitrust authority Autoridade da Concorrência(). The Autoridade da Concorrência accuses various private laboratories in Portugal of colluding to limit price fixing and influence market allocation and access. In addition to two Portuguese subsidiaries, the statement of objections of the Portuguese antitrust authority also directly relate to SYNLAB AG as concerned party. In this context, a provision for processes and risk provisions was set up in the consolidated financial statements in the reporting year. The risk assessment to be made regarding the course of the antitrust proceedings and the evaluation of whether and to what extent it is necessary to recognise a provision as a liability to cover the risks is characterised by estimates and assumptions by the executive directors and is subject to a high degree of uncertainty, also due to the early stage of the proceedings. From our point of view, this matter was of particular importance for our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the 2022 financial year due to the considerable uncertainties regarding the course and outcome of the proceedings as well as the possible effects of the antitrust proceedings on the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of SYNLAB Group. The Company’s disclosures on the applied “Accounting and valuation principles” and on “Use of estimates and assumptions” are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 2.6.2 and on “Provisions” in section 30. b) As part of our audit, we examined, among other things, the processes established by SYNLAB AG for recording, for legal and accounting treatment and for the presentation of legal disputes and legal proceedings in the consolidated financial statements. In the reporting year, this primarily concerned the substantive discussion of the accusations made in the context of the above-mentioned antitrust proceedings and their possible consequences. As the legal assessment and the resulting valuation decisions of the executive directors have a direct impact on the consolidated result and the control-relevant parameter AEBITDA, we have assessed the assessment and valuation, including the underlying methods and assumptions, of the executive directors under involving an internal antitrust expert. Furthermore, we had several discussions with employees of the central legal department of SYNLAB AG and its external experts for antitrust law issues and had the executive directors explain to us the development and the reasons that led to their current assessment. The presentation of the background and status of the antitrust proceedings as of the balance sheet date, including the assessments of ----- SYNLAB AG ### Independent auditors report to the members of Synlab AG the executive directors with regard to the risks resulting from this for SYNLAB Group, was made available to us in summarised written form by the executive directors of the Company. As at the balance sheet date, we have also obtained external lawyers' confirmations on the antitrust proceedings and assessed them with the involvement of our internal antitrust expert. We also appreciated the competence, skills and objectivity of the external lawyers commissioned by SYNLAB AG. On this basis, we have understood the assessments made by the executive directors of the status of the proceedings and their decisions on the presentation of the facts within the consolidated financial statements and, in particular, on the valuation of the provision recognised, including the methods and assumptions used.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Recoverability of goodwill,2862.20.1,,"a) As at 31 December 2021, goodwill totals mEUR 2,440 (31 Dec. 2020: mEUR 2,212), which overall include four cash-generating-units (“CGU”) and groups of CGUs, respectively. As at 31 December 2021, the executive directors of the parent company carried out impairment tests of goodwill in compliance with IAS 36 (impairment of assets), by means of a detailed measurement of the value in use of the CGUs and CGU groups, respectively, by using the discounted cash flow model. The determination of the value in use is based on the planning of SYNLAB AG’s executive directors, which consists of a three-year plan (budget for 2022 and strategic medium-term planning 2023 to 2024) as well as a projection for two more years, which is continued with assumptions on long-term growth rates. In this case, the budget and the medium-term planning are approved by the supervisory board and the executive board, respectively. In so doing, the executive directors concluded that there is no need for impairment. The result of the impairment tests highly depends on the executive directors’ assessment of future cash inflows to the respective CGUs and CGU groups as well as of the discount rate (weighted average cost of capital) and hence is subject to significant uncertainty. This issue was of particular importance within the scope of our audit considering the existing uncertainties and discretionary scope and due to the complexity of the measurement model the measurement was based on. Information provided by the executive directors of the parent company on the recoverability of goodwill as well as their impairment tests are included in sections 2.6 and 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. b) First, we developed an understanding of the relevant methods the executive directors applied as well as of the assumptions and data sources used relating to the measurement of goodwill. This also included the manner and ways of ascertaining the planning figures for future cash inflows as well as ascertaining the discount rates. ----- SYNLAB AG",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,2862,TRANSLATION,2862.21,Group Management Report As at 31 December 2021,2862.21.1,,"According to our audit strategy we have conducted scaled audit procedures in accordance with our risk assessment. Our risk assessment was primarily based on headroom and sensitivity analyses. Our audit procedures, which were conducted step-by-step, are described below. When conducting the impairment tests, we integrated internal measurement specialists into our audit team. With their help, we audited whether the essential parameters used during the calculations such as for example the used discount rates and sustainable growth rates in the perpetual pension as well as the planned cash inflows were appropriate, by comparing these values with the multi-year budget figures for 2022 to 2026 adopted by the executive directors as well as by checking the plausibility of the measurement assumptions made based on general and industryspecific market forecasts and expectations as well as publicly available forecasts from financial analysts regarding SYNLAB AG. Apart from that, we examined the accuracy of the forecasts over time. We scrutinised the planned revenues using internal evidence and provided information as well as publicly available external market assessments all the while considering internal and publicly available external sources regarding their assessment on the development of the coronavirus pandemic and its economic impact. In addition, we examined the allocation of corporate assets and corporate costs to the CGUs and CGU groups, respectively. Considering that even relatively small changes of the discount rate may have a significant impact on the determined amount of the Company’s value, we also made the parameters used to determine each discount rate (WACC) including the resulting weighted average cost of capital (WACC) plausible based on own control and comparison calculations, respectively. Finally, we examined the information provided by the executive directors in the notes to the consolidated financial statements regarding the measurement of goodwill as well as the information provided on the impairment tests with regard to their completeness and compliance with the requirements of IAS 36. The executive directors characterised this non-cash capital increase as capital reorganisation. Hence, as of 27 April 2021, any and all assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated financial statements of SYNLAB Limited were transferred to the consolidated financial statements of SYNLAB AG and continued at their carrying amounts (including comparative values as at 31 December 2020). Moreover, the consolidated financial statements of SYNLAB AG for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 do not only include income and expenses for SYNLAB Group as of the date of the contribution of the shares on 27 April 2021, but they rather include SYNLAB Group’s income and expenses for the entire calendar year from 1 January to 31 December 2021 (including comparative values for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2020). In so doing, the question arose whether the regulations of IFRS 3 (business combinations) had to be applied or if the matter had to be classified as a transaction under common control for which the IFRS 3 regulations are not applicable. In case the IFRS 3 do not apply, the IFRS do not contain any specific regulations on the recognition of such transactions in the balance sheet. In this case, according to IAS 8 (accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors), an accounting method would have to be developed and applied, providing relevant and reliable information to the users of the financial statements for their economic decision-making process. This would also entail the question how to present the reporting period and the comparative period for the consolidated financial statements of SYNLAB AG for the financial year ended 31 December 2021. In light of the potential lack of explicit IFRS regulations for the presentation of the transaction in the balance sheet, existing discretionary scope and the significance for understanding the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group for the users of the consolidated financial statements due to the complexity of this matter, it was of particular importance during our audit. Information provided by the parent company’s executive directors regarding the capital reorganisation are included in section 1 of the notes to the financial statements. b) While auditing this matter, we integrated internal IFRS specialists into our audit team. Within the scope of our audit procedure, we examined to which extent the matter classifies as a reversed acquisition or as a business combination under common control and whether the IFRS 3 have to be applied. Afterwards, we acknowledged to which extent the executive directors developed and applied an accounting method providing relevant and reliable information to the users of the consolidated financial statements for their economic decision-making process. For this reason, we have obtained an understanding of the internal documentation and the corresponding explanations provided by the Company regarding the chosen accounting method and we have critically reviewed and acknowledged the contractual bases (contribution agreement) and the resolutions of the general meetings as well as further documents and evidence, the capital measures taken and implemented were based on. Furthermore, we discussed applicable legal balance-sheet related literature and professional legal directives as well as obtained expert knowledge from internal IFRS specialists we contacted and evaluated the gathered information and facts. ----- SYNLAB AG Based on the result of the assessment of the approach chosen by SYNLAB AG’s executive directors to represent the transaction as a capital reorganisation and hence outside of the regulations of IFRS 3 in accordance with IAS 8 para. 10 et seq., we reviewed the transfer of the values from the consolidated financial statements of SYNLAB Limited as well as the information provided by the executive directors of the parent company in the notes to the consolidated financial statements regarding the capital reorganisation. This matter constitutes a key audit matter from our point of view, as a large extent of judgement is necessary regarding the executive directors’ estimates and the results of these estimates are significant for the financial statements overall. In light of the existing discretionary scopes and due to the complexity of the determining methods and models, which served as basis, this matter was of particular importance during our audit. Information provided by the parent company’s executive directors on estimates when determining and cutting off of revenue are included in sections 2.6 and 3 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. b) We tested the design and implementation of accounting-related internal controls and the general IT controls from selected laboratory information, billing and accounting systems as well as regarding estimated revenues. In addition, we developed an understanding of the relevant methods, assumptions and data sources used by the executive directors regarding the estimated revenues. In order to assess the quality of the estimates in the past, we have conducted retrospective analyses while critically assessing deviations. In so doing, we conducted the following audit procedures all the while maintaining professional judgement: Validation with average prices, that we have ascertained ourselves from the billed population, plausibility checks based on historic information and on external market data, regulations and agreements as well as understanding the executive directors’ billing method. Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, to consider whether the other information - is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or - otherwise appears to be materially misstated. - evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and with the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB. - obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions. - evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides. - perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in the auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter. ----- SYNLAB AG In addition, the executive directors of the Company are responsible for such internal controls that they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of ESEF documents that are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section 328 (1) HGB. The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting process.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Capital reorganisation as part of a non-cash capital increase,2862.22.1,,"a) SYNLAB AG was established as a ready-made company under the company “ISARSMARAGD AG”. After Ephios Luxembourg S.à.r.l., Luxembourg/Luxembourg, obtained any and all shares, the articles of association were amended by resolution of the general meeting held on 11 January 2021. The commercial register was notified of the new establishment from an economic perspective on 4 March 2021. The company ISARSMARAGD AG was renamed to SYNLAB AG by resolution of the general meeting held on 18 March 2021. A non-cash capital increase was carried out by resolution of the extraordinary general meeting held on 27 April 2021. This capital increase was achieved by the former shareholders of SYNLAB Limited, London/Great Britain, contributing their respective shares in SYNLAB Limited to SYNLAB AG as part of a contribution agreement in exchange for the corresponding number of new shares in SYNLAB AG. As of this point in time, SYNLAB AG consequently has to be regarded as parent company of SYNLAB Group. SYNLAB AG’s shareholder structure after the contribution in kind is identical to the former shareholder structure of SYNLAB Limited. ----- SYNLAB AG",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Requirement for estimates in connection with the determination and cut-off of realised revenue in Germany,2862.25.1,,"a) The Group generates revenue with a wide range of clinical laboratory and medical diagnostic services for insurance companies, hospitals, individuals, pharmacies and national health organisations. These services are primarily provided in the area of human medicine but are also provided in the area of veterinary medicine. On the one hand, the agreed accounting modalities are based on the respective country-specific conditions for publicly regulated healthcare systems as well as on individual agreements concluded with any natural person or legal entity outside of the publicly regulated healthcare system on the other hand. The accounting processes resulting from the complex accounting laws – particularly in Germany – require estimates be made to a significant extent at the end of the financial year when determining and cutting-off realised revenue. In Germany, significant revenue estimates are necessary in the following areas: i) Realisation of revenue in connection with tests performed but not yet finally billed. These revenues are subject to risks regarding their measurement as assumptions on the determination of average prices are to be made. When budgets are agreed upon, assumptions for forecasts for the budgeted period have to be calculated additionally due to regular pricing depending on the volume. Moreover, when dealing with regulated prices, assumptions on the consideration of billing restrictions need to be considered. These estimates are particularly complex, especially in the German part of the Group, due to the multitude of existing regulations. ii) Revenue and quotes for services, respectively, that are billed via the public health insurance’s system depend on doctors’ performance requirements in connection with set budgets public health insurance companies have in due consideration of the according restriction instruments, which are only determined well after the service has been rendered. The estimate is made considering historic information and values as well as current expectations the executive directors have. The Group revenue for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 includes cut-off revenue of mEUR 235.7. Based on the estimate, the revenue share in Germany amounts to mEUR 178.8. ----- SYNLAB AG",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report. We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also - identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. - obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems. - evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures. - conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern. ----- SYNLAB AG",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Reporting entity The consolidated financial statements were prepared by SYNLAB Aktiengesellschaft (hereinafter: “AG” or “the Company”), the ultimate parent company of the SYNLAB Group. The Group’s consolidated financial statements as at and for the period ended 31 December 2022 consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group” and individually as “Group entities”) and include the Group’s interests in associates. The consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2022 were released for publication on 13 March 2023 by resolution of the Management Board. The SYNLAB Group is Europe’s largest private supplier of medical diagnostic services, focusing primarily on clinical diagnostics testing and screening services. The Group, which is based in Germany, employs approximately 29,000 people and benefits from a pan-European network spanning 36 countries. The Group is currently active in Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Mexico, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Panama, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, U.A.E., Ukraine and the United Kingdom. The address of SYNLAB AG is Moosacher Strasse 88, 80809 Munich, Germany. ----- SYNLAB AG #### 2. Basis of preparation Due to rounding, numbers presented throughout this and other documents may not add up precisely to the totals provided and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures. ###### 2.1 Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements relate to SYNLAB AG, Munich, Germany (commercial register number HRB 246540), and its subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union (EU), and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to section 315 e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The consolidated financial statements comply with IFRS as published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). SYNLAB prepares and publishes the consolidated financial statements in euros (€). ###### 2.2 IFRS basis adopted 2.2.1 Standards, amendments and interpretations effective or adopted in 2022 From 1 January 2022, the Group applied a number of amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that are mandatorily effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Their adoption did not have any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in these financial statements: - Amendments to IFRS 3 Reference to the Conceptual Framework - Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment – Proceeds before Intended Use - Amendments to IAS 37 Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract - Annual Improvements to IFRS Accounting Standards 2018-2020 Cycle 2.2.2 New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet applicable At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Group had not applied the following new and revised IFRS Accounting Standards that have been issued but are not yet effective - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (including the June 2020 and December 2021 amendments to IFRS 17) - Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28: Sale or Contribution of Assets - Amendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current - Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments to IAS 8: Definition of Accounting Estimates - Amendments to IAS 12: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction The directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods. ###### 2.3 Basis of measurement The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for the following items in the statement of financial position: - derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and - certain long-term financial assets are measured at fair value. ----- SYNLAB AG ###### 2.4 Functional and presentation currency These consolidated financial statements are presented in euro, which is the Company’s functional currency. All financial information presented in euro has been rounded to the nearest thousand. ###### 2.5 Going concern The Group’s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. As at 31 December 2022, the Group had net assets of 2,333.2 M€ (31 December 2021: 2,255.7 M€) and net current assets of 439.8 M€ (31 December 2021: 356.8 M€). For the year ended 31 December of 2022, the Group reported an operating cash flow of 629.6 M€ (31. December 2021: 1,011.7 M€), cash flow from investing activities of -215.7 M€ (31 December 2021: -381.0 M€), cash flow from financing activities of -319.8 M€ (31 December 2021: -1,104.1 M€) and cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period of 541.6 M€ (31 December 2021: 443.5 M€). The directors consider the going concern basis to be appropriate following their assessment of the Group’s financial position and its ability to meet its obligations as and when they fall due. Testing, and particularly medical testing, is a resilient and defensive market on which past economic or capital market downturns have only had a limited impact. ###### 2.6 Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of the consolidated Group financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in applying the Group’s accounting policies to determine the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions to accounting estimates applied prospectively.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,173,GERMAN PUBLIC AUDITOR RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENGAGEMENT,173.32,2.6.1 Critical accounting judgements,173.32.1,,"In applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has applied judgement in the following areas that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements. ###### LEASES The evaluation of whether the exercise/non-exercise of purchase or extension/termination options is “reasonably certain” may require substantial judgement. The Group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option, upon the occurrence of either a significant event or a significant change in circumstances that: - is within the control of the lessee; and - affects whether the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option not previously included in its determination of the lease term, or not to exercise an option previously included in its determination of the lease term. The Group revises the lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a lease. For example, the noncancellable period of a lease will change if one of the following occurs: - the lessee exercises an option not previously included in the entity’s determination of the lease term; - the lessee does not exercise an option previously included in the entity’s determination of the lease term; ----- SYNLAB AG - an event occurs that contractually obliges the lessee to exercise an option not previously included in the entity’s determination of the lease term; or - an event occurs that contractually prohibits the lessee from exercising an option previously included in the entity’s determination of the lease term. The lease term may also be revised following a reassessment as to whether an extension option is reasonably certain to be exercised, or whether a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised. ###### BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company, and each of those companies over which it exercises control. Control over an entity exists when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When the Group has less than a majority of voting or similar rights in an entity, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an entity, including the contractual arrangements, and voting rights and potential voting rights. The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to the elements of control. This assessment is key in certain jurisdictions where the regulations governing the ownership and certification of laboratories require the Group to hold each clinical laboratory or a limited number of the clinical laboratories through a separate subsidiary.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. ###### REVENUE ESTIMATION The Group earns revenues from a wide range of analysis and diagnostic testing services, which are invoiced to a range of customers including insurance companies, hospitals, individuals, pharmacies and national health organisations. The most significant areas of revenue estimation in the Group relate to: a) revenue recognised based on as yet, unconfirmed public health budgets, where revenue is estimated using historical patterns and other publicly available information (Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Spain being the main countries in which this method is applied); and b) accrued revenue based on completed but unbilled tests, where the calculation of the value of those tests include a level of estimation based on - pricing mechanisms as agreed during contract negotiations and used to calculate average prices; - historical experience; and - actual work performed (e.g. analyses completed). Based on historical data and experience, the measures are reliable, and the economic benefits associated with the revenue recognised based on these measures are likely to flow to the entity. ----- SYNLAB AG Please refer to Note 3 for further details. ###### GOODWILL AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL The Group determines on an annual basis whether goodwill is impaired. The determination as to whether goodwill has been impaired involves estimation of the key inputs in the impairment process including: - the forecast cash flows and management assumptions for revenue growth and EBITDA margin used in making the determinations which are based on financial budgets covering a five-year period; - the key assumptions in calculating the discount rates applied to each cash-generating unit or group of cashgenerating units (“CGUs”), in particular the risk-free rate, equity risk premium, size premium and tax rates which are used in the calculation; and - the terminal growth rates applied to each of the CGUs. Please refer to Note 17, Goodwill. ###### ACQUISITIONS Acquisition accounting involves estimation in determining the fair value of the intangible assets through a purchase price allocation assumed in a business combination and the fair value of the consideration payable. The key areas of estimation include: - estimates in accounting for any unusual terms and conditions in the respective share purchase agreement (“SPA”), including contingent consideration. These amounts are contingent on the acquired business meeting agreed performance targets. At the date of the acquisition, the Group reviews the profit and cash forecasts for the acquired business and estimates the amount of contingent consideration that is likely to be due. See Note 31, Trade Payables and other Liabilities; and - the key assumptions within the fair value calculation of the intangible assets through a purchase price allocation, specifically the discount rates, revenue growth rates and future cash flow forecasts. Please refer to Note 4, Significant events, and Note 18, Intangible assets. ###### PENSION AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The determination of pension and other post-employment benefit obligations and expenses for defined benefit plans is dependent on a number of estimates and assumptions, including the discount rate and future mortality rate. The changes in assumptions and actuarial estimates may affect the benefit obligation, future expense and future cash flow. Refer to Notes 3 and 28. ###### PROVISION FOR LITIGATION The determination of provisions for litigation depends on a number of estimates and assumptions regarding the facts of the case, the amount of damages, the amount of potential fines and the probability of occurrence. Please refer to Note 30 provisions. ----- SYNLAB AG",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique.

Control is achieved when the Company direct or indirect: - has power over the investee; - is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and - has the ability to use its power to influence those returns. When the Company directly or indirectly has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it assesses whether it has power over the investee if it has sufficient voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the Company’s voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including: ----- SYNLAB AG - the size of the Company’s share of voting rights relative to the size and distribution of the proportions of other holders of voting rights; - potential voting rights held by the Company, other holders of voting rights or other parties; - rights arising from other contractual arrangements including articles of association, shareholders’ agreement; and - any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Company has, or does not have, the current ability to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made. Regulations governing the ownership and certification of laboratories in certain jurisdictions require the Group to hold each clinical laboratory or a limited number of the clinical laboratories through a separate subsidiary. Certain countries also regulate the corporate form through which laboratories may be held, such as the MVZ in Germany and the SEL in France. In France, the Group is subject to regulatory constraints on the ownership of share capital and voting rights of SELs operating clinical laboratories by persons other than laboratory doctors and laboratory companies. In fact, since the French law on medical biology was adopted on 30 May 2013 (which includes a grandfathering clause for existing SELs that operate under a different ownership structure where the majority of their share capital is held by laboratory companies as of the date of enactment), laboratory doctors practicing in an SEL should hold the majority of voting rights and the majority of the share capital. To comply with such regulatory constraints, the Group has put in place a specific corporate structure, under which, and subject to a few exceptions, the Group, directly or indirectly, holds the maximum percentage of shares authorised by the law (up to 99.9% of share capital for historical SELs owned before May 2013 and 49.9% of share capital for SELs acquired since May 2013), while some of the laboratory doctors practicing in said SEL hold the remaining shares. However, in all instances, the Group has been granted substantially all of the economic rights. This is done by issuing preferred shares in cases where laboratory doctors practicing in said SEL hold more than 50% of the share capital. The Group has therefore put in place mechanisms that grant it substantially all of the economic rights in such SELs and allow it to control the relevant activities in accordance with the French regulatory framework and to fully consolidate its French network. The control exercised over French subsidiaries is based on specific governance mechanisms and contractual agreements with laboratory doctors practicing in the SEL. These mechanisms and contractual agreements are classified by the Group as de facto control. In Germany, German fee regulations mean that registered doctors outsource a wide range of laboratory procedures to medical collaborative laboratories (“CLs”), which may also be responsible for billing. The sole shareholders of such CLs are registered doctors co-operating to provide the required services in an economically viable way. As a laboratory services provider, the SYNLAB Group thus sometimes has to cooperate based on contractual agreements with these CLs in order to render services. As a consequence of these contracts, most of the benefits from the CL’s business operations accrue to the Group, i.e. the Group has put in place mechanisms that grant it the majority of the economic rights in such CLs and allow it to control the relevant activities in accordance with the German regulatory framework. The Group therefore takes the view that it has control over the CLs even though it does not own a shareholding from a legal perspective. These entities are therefore fully consolidated.

Those interests of minority shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a corresponding share of net assets upon liquidation may initially be measured at fair value or at the minority shareholders’ corresponding share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. For medical biology companies, whether controlled de jure or de facto, minority interests of other shareholders, i.e. laboratory doctors, must be assessed based on the financial rights attached to their shares rather than the percentage of share capital or voting rights. The Group has an insignificant amount of minority interests.

504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,2699,REVENUE,2699.1,Human medicine,2699.1.1,,"_Health insurance funds_ Generally, the contractual basis for revenue from health insurance funds comes from framework contracts and/or from statutory regulations that define general terms and conditions that are applied to individual orders to perform an analysis. The basis for remuneration with respect to revenues differs by country, type of analysis and/or contract type. For contracts that – despite fixed prices per analysis – contain elements that cause variability such as e.g. volume-based discounts, allocated budgets/caps, and quotation rates, the amount of consideration will be estimated based on the expected value and historical experience. The (estimated) transaction price per analysis is recognised once the results of the analysis have been validated and reported to the requester. _Doctors_ In most cases SYNLAB acts as a principal whereas the doctor (as an agent) arranges the sale with the patient (while using the results for their diagnosis). Each patient (customer) enters into a contract with SYNLAB as soon as the doctor transmits the laboratory analysis form (order) with the required services and the patient information on behalf of the patient. As a result, each order is considered to be a contract with the customer. Accordingly, SYNLAB generally invoices the beneficiary (i.e. the patient) for laboratory services. For contracts where the doctor does not act as an agent and is invoiced by SYNLAB the doctor is considered to be the customer. The basis for remuneration per analysis and patient is generally based on regulated tariffs, i.e. medical fee schedules. The (estimated) transaction price per analysis is recognised once the results of the analysis have been validated and reported to the requester. ----- SYNLAB AG Any payments made to the doctor with respect to the collaboration agreement (e.g. signing fees or allowances per analysis) reduce the transaction price. Depending on their nature, they either reduce revenue by order or over the contract duration. _Private patients_ Private patients are invoiced directly and, even if an insurance company might refund the private patient for the costs incurred, the claim to consideration is against the private patient. The transaction price for an analysis is based on medical fee schedules and, therefore, fixed upfront without later adjustments. As each contract (order) has only one performance obligation, there is no need to allocate the transaction price (per analysis). The transaction price per analysis is recognised once the results of the analysis have been validated and reported to the requester. _Hospitals_ In the case of contracts with hospitals, SYNLAB often provides more than one service to the customer and/or delivers more than one good. Therefore, in these cases, two or more contracts entered into at or near the same time with the same hospital (or related parties of the hospital) have to be combined and accounted for as a single contract if (i) the contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective; (ii) the amount of consideration to be paid in one contract depends on the price or performance of the other contract; or (iii) the goods or services promised in the contracts are considered to be a single performance obligation. The activities performed to generate revenue might include e.g. logistics, analytics and the provision of a result. With respect to lab operations, there are three major types of service arrangements: Type 1: SYNLAB operates an external lab (outside the hospital’s premises). Accordingly, the arrangement typically includes logistics services (transportation of samples from the hospital to the external lab). Type 2: SYNLAB operates a lab on the hospital’s premises to meet quality standards (e.g. response times) or for economic reasons (e.g. to reduce transportation cost), but is not legally bound to do so. SYNLAB has not promised to operate a lab on the hospital’s premises and the hospital has no enforceable right to demand in-house lab operations. Type 3: SYNLAB operates a lab on the hospital’s premises because it has promised to do so and the hospital has an enforceable right to demand in-house lab operations. For type 1 and type 2 arrangements, the service promised to the customer is an analysis, i.e. the combined output of several activities that are either not capable of being distinct or not distinct within the context of the contract (because they are highly interrelated). As a result, each contract (order) has only one performance obligation. For type 3 arrangements, the promise to the customer constitutes the complete outsourcing of in-house lab operations for a specified period of time. This bundled service also includes incidental services that are highly interrelated to the outsourcing of in-house lab operations. Therefore, there is only one performance obligation, which is the operation of the hospital’s in-house lab (including all analyses performed). In type 1 and 2 arrangements, the transaction price for an analysis is typically based on medical fee schedules. In addition, there might be volume-based discounts, allocated budgets/caps, quotation rates or other clauses that might ----- SYNLAB AG cause variability even if the price per analysis due to the medical fee schedule is fixed. In these cases, the amount of consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for providing each analysis shall be estimated. Type 3 arrangements typically include an annual fixed amount of consideration that might be constant or increase or decrease from period to period. In addition, there is typically a variable component based on the number and complexity of analyses actually performed within each period. Accordingly, the amount of consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for transferring the lab operation services to the hospital shall be estimated. In each type of arrangement discussed above, there is only one performance obligation. In the case of type 1 and type 2 arrangements, the obligation is to perform an analysis. There is no need to allocate the (estimated) transaction price (per analysis). In the case of type 3 arrangements, the obligation is to operate the hospital’s in-house lab for a specified period of time. The transaction price shall be estimated for the total service period. With respect to type 1 and type 2 arrangements, the (estimated) transaction price (per analysis) is recognised once the results of the analysis have been validated and reported to the requester. In type 3 arrangements, SYNLAB performs recurring services in relation to the in-house lab operations, which are received and simultaneously consumed by the hospital. Thus, the performance obligation is satisfied over time (total service period) and revenue shall be recognised by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. _Other labs, public agencies and other companies_ The contracting party ordering an analysis is the customer according to IFRS 15. In general, the contractual basis for revenues from other labs, public agencies and other companies comes from general service agreements. The activities performed to generate revenue might include e.g. logistics, analytics and the provision of a result. However, the service promised to the customer is an analysis (even for multiple parameters), i.e. the combined output of several activities that are either not capable of being distinct or not distinct within the context of the contract (because they are highly interrelated). As a result, each contract (purchase order) has only one performance obligation. As each contract (purchase order) has only one performance obligation, there is no need to allocate the (estimated) transaction price (per analysis). The basis for remuneration with respect to revenue from other labs, public agencies and other companies is the prices stated in the contract. In general, the price for each kind of analysis is fixed. With respect to revenue from other labs, public agencies and other companies, the (estimated) transaction price (per analysis) is recognised once the results of the analysis have been validated and reported to the customer. _Revenue from veterinary medicine_ In general, revenue from veterinary medicine is based on an offer and an acceptance with reference to a price list. Typically, there is a standard price list with fixed prices for each kind of analysis. The activities performed to generate revenue might include e.g. logistics, analytics and the provision of a result. However, the service promised to the customer is an analysis (even for multiple parameters), i.e. the combined output of several activities that are either not capable of being distinct or not distinct within the context of the contract (because they are highly interrelated). As a result, each acceptance (order) has only one performance obligation. ----- SYNLAB AG As each acceptance (order) has only one performance obligation, there is no need to allocate the (estimated) transaction price (per analysis). With respect to revenue from veterinary medicine, the transaction price (per analysis) is recognised once the results of the analysis have been validated and reported to the customer. _Revenue from trading goods_ The contracting party ordering the trading goods is the customer according to IFRS 15. The contractual basis for revenue from trading goods can be a stand-alone contract or part of another contract (e.g. with hospitals or doctors). Typically, trading goods are both capable of being distinct and distinct within the context of the contract. Accordingly, each trading good is considered to be a separate performance obligation. The basis for remuneration with respect to revenues from trading goods is the prices stated in the contract. In general, the price for each trading good is fixed and – if the contractual basis is part of another contract – not interrelated to other goods or services in that contract. Accordingly, there is no variability in consideration. In general, the prices for trading goods as stated in the contract reflect the stand-alone selling price for such trading goods, i.e. the price at which SYNLAB would sell the trading goods separately to another customer with similar characteristics. With respect to trading goods (that are considered to be a separate performance obligation), the transaction price for the trading goods is recognised on delivery of the trading goods to the customer. _Health insurance funds_ Generally, the contractual basis for the revenue from health insurance funds comes from frame contracts and/or from regulatory rulings that define general terms and conditions that are applied to individual orders to perform an analysis. The basis for remuneration with respect to revenues differs by country, type of analysis and/or contract type. For contracts that – despite fixed prices per analysis- contain elements that cause variability such as e.g. volume based discounts, allocated budgets/caps, quotation rates, the amount of consideration will be estimated based on the expected value and historical experience. ----- SYNLAB AG The (estimated) transaction price per analysis is recognised once the results of the analysis have been validated and reported to the requester. _Doctors_ In most cases SYNLAB acts as a principal whereas the doctor (as an agent) is arranging the sale with the patient (while using the results for his diagnosis). Each patient (customer) enters into a contract with SYNLAB as soon as the doctor transmits the laboratory analysis form (order) with the required services and the patient information on behalf of the patient. As a result, each order is considered to be a contract with the customer. Accordingly, SYNLAB is generally invoicing the beneficiary (i.e. the patient) for laboratory services. For contracts where the doctor does not act as an agent and is invoiced by SYNLAB he or she is considered to be the customer. The basis for remuneration per analysis and patient is generally based on regulated tariffs, i.e. medical fee schedule. The (estimated) transaction price per analysis is recognised once the results of the analysis have been validated and reported to the requester. Any payments made to the doctor with respect to the collaboration agreement (e.g. signing fees or allowances per analysis) reduce the transaction price. Depending on their nature they either reduce revenue by order or over the contract duration. _Private patients_ Private patients are invoiced directly and even if an insurance company might refund the private patient for the costs incurred, the claim to consideration is against the private patient. The transaction price for an analysis is based on medical fee schedules and thus, fixed upfront without later adjustments. As each contract (order) has only one performance obligation, there is no need to allocate the transaction price (per analysis). The transaction price per analysis is recognised once the results of the analysis have been validated and reported to the requester. _Hospitals_ In case of contracts with hospitals, SYNLAB often provides more than one service to the customer and/or delivers more than one good. Therefore, in these cases, two or more contracts entered into at or near the same time with the same hospital (or related parties of the hospital) have to be combined and accounted for the contracts as a single contract if (i) the contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective; (ii) the amount of consideration to be paid in one contract depends on the price or performance of the other contract; or (iii) the goods or services promised in the contracts are considered to be a single performance obligation. The activities performed to generate revenues might include e.g. logistics, analytics and the provision of a result. With respect to lab operations, there are three major types of service arrangements: Type 1: SYNLAB operates an external lab (outside the hospital’s premises). Accordingly, the arrangement typically includes logistic services (transportation of samples from the hospital to the external lab). ----- SYNLAB AG Type 2: SYNLAB operates a lab onsite the hospital’s premises to meet quality standards (e.g. response times) or for economic reasons (e.g. to reduce transportation cost), but is not legally bound to do so. SYNLAB has not promised to operate a lab onsite the hospital’s premises and the hospital has no enforceable right to demand in-house lab operations. Type 3: SYNLAB operates a lab onsite the hospital’s premises because it has promised to do so and the hospital has an enforceable right to demand in-house lab operations. For type 1 and type 2 arrangements, the service promised to the customer is an analysis, i.e. the combined output of the several activities, which are either not capable of being distinct or not distinct within the context of the contract (due to high interrelation). As a result, each contract (order) has only one performance obligation. For type 3 arrangements, the nature of the promise to the customer is to a complete outsourcing of in-house lab operations for a specified period of time. This bundled service also includes incidental services that are highly interrelated to the outsourcing of in-house lab operations. Thus, there is only one performance obligation, which is the operation of the hospital’s in-house lab (including all analysis performed). In type 1 and 2 arrangements the transaction price for an analysis is typically based on medical fee schedules. In addition, there might be volume based discounts, allocated budgets / caps, quotation rates or other clauses that might cause variability even if the price per analysis due to the medical fee schedule is fixed. In this cases, the amount of consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for providing each analysis shall be estimated. Type 3 arrangements typically include an annual fixed amount of consideration that might be constant or increasing or decreasing from period to period. In addition, there is typically a variable component based on the number and complexity of analysis actually performed within each period. Accordingly, the amount of consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for transferring the lab operation services to the hospital shall be estimated. In each type of arrangement discussed above, there is only one performance obligation. In case of type 1 and type 2 arrangements, the obligation is to perform an analysis.

The Group applies the principles set out in IFRS 15 for revenue recognition by using the following five steps: ----- SYNLAB AG 1. Identify the contract(s) with a customer. 2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 3. Determine the transaction price. 4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. 5. Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In general, contracts with customers are clustered in major revenue streams and their substreams.

504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,2530,LEASES,2530.1,,2530.1.1,,"At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether the contract is or contains a lease. The Group recognises a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease arrangements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets (defined as all leases of assets with an original price of up to EUR 5,000.00 or local currency equivalent). For shortterm and low-value leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased assets are consumed. Lease liabilities When initially recognised, the lease liability is valued at the present value of the lease payments not yet made on the provision date and discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise: - fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives; - variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date; - the amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees; - the exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and - payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the lease. Variable rents that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and the right of use asset. The related payments are recognised as an expense in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs. ----- SYNLAB AG The lease liability is presented as a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position. The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. The Group remeasures the lease liability and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset whenever: - the lease term has changed or there is a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. - the lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is measured by discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount rate (unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used). - a lease contract is modified, and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. Lease payments Lease payments included in the measurement of the liability comprise: - fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable; - variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date; - the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; - payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the lease; and - the amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees; - lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease and residual value guarantees. The lease liability is subsequently measured after the commencement date by: - increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest method); - reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. Lease modifications Modifications of leases are assessed to ascertain whether the modification should be accounted for as a separate lease agreement or, effectively, a continuation of the existing lease. Lease modifications are accounted as separate leases when both of the following conditions are met: - the modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets; and - the consideration for the lease increases by an amount commensurate with the stand-alone price for the increase in scope and any appropriate adjustments to that stand-alone price to reflect the circumstances of the particular contract. When lease modifications are not accounted for as a separate lease at the effective date of the lease modification, the Group - allocates the consideration in the modified contract by applying the requirements of IFRS 16.13 to 16; - determines the lease term of the modified lease by applying the requirements of IFRS 16.18 and 19; and ----- SYNLAB AG - remeasures the lease liability by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. The Group accounts for the remeasurement of the lease liability as follows: - for lease modifications that decrease the scope of the lease, by decreasing the carrying amount of the right of use asset to reflect the partial or full termination of the lease. Any gain or loss relating to the partial or full termination of the lease is recognised in profit or loss; and - for all other lease modifications, by making a corresponding adjustment to the right of use asset and lease liability. Right of use assets The right of use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Whenever the Group incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, a provision is recognised and measured under IAS 37. To the extent that the costs related to a right of use asset, the costs are included in the related right of use asset, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories. Right of use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset, or if the cost of the right of use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right of use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease. The right of use assets are presented as a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position. The Group applies IAS 36 to determine whether a right of use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss as described in the policy on property, plant and equipment. Short-term lease The Group makes use of the short-term lease exemption for all leases that, as at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less, including any extension options. Rentals for short-team leases are recognised as an operating expense in profit or loss. The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of the contract.

Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity (attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate). Differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity. On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, or a partial disposal of an interest in a joint arrangement or an associate that includes a foreign operation of which the retained interest becomes a financial asset), all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the Company are reclassified to profit or loss. This year, Turkey was assessed as a hyperinflationary country. The Turkish Institute of Statistics reported a three-year cumulative inflation rate of 109% for March 2022, and the country’s economy has been classified as hyperinflationary since 30 June 2022. If the functional currency of an entity is that of a hyperinflationary economy, the accounting rules of IAS 29 must be applied as if the currency of the economy had always been hyperinflationary (retrospective application). IAS 29 was applied for the first time as if Turkey had always been classified as a hyperinflationary ----- SYNLAB AG economy. The net gains or losses from the ongoing inflation of non-monetary assets and liabilities as well as equity and all items in the statement of income are recognised in profit or loss in other operating income. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are generally based on the historical cost concept. Due to changes in the general purchasing power of the functional currency, these financial statements had to be adjusted to the measurement unit applicable on the reporting date. Comparative figures that previously corresponded to a non-hyperinflationary currency do not need to be adjusted (unlike in the individual financial statements of Turkish companies). The total restatement effect from the ongoing inflation is equal to 0.8 M€ for the period ended 31 December 2022 and is recognised in “other operating income - Income from foreign currency transactions” line item. The price index applicable to Turkey was 1.128,45 points as at 31 December 2022 (686,95 points as at 31 December 2021). ###### FINANCE INCOME AND FINANCE COSTS Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested, dividend income, gains on hedging instruments that are recognised at fair value in profit or loss and foreign currency gains. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date that the Group’s right to receive payment is established. Finance costs comprise the cost of net debt and other financial expenses. Cost of net debt includes interest expense on borrowings and financial leases, as well as expenses related to derivatives. Other financial expenses mainly include the unwinding of the discount on provisions. Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. The Group does not own any qualifying assets. ###### RETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS Depending on the laws and practices in force in the countries where the Group operates, Group companies have legal obligations in terms of pensions, early retirement payments and retirement bonuses. Such obligations are generally state-managed defined contribution plans, but the Group is also affected by post-employment or post-retirement employees’ benefits. #### Defined contribution plans Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions. Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit plans are accounted for as payments to defined contribution plans where the Group’s obligations under the plans are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan. #### Defined benefit plans and similar obligations For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. Remeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest) are recognised immediately in the statement of financial position with a charge or credit to other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements recognized in other comprehensive income are not reclassified. Past service cost is recognised in profit or loss when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs, or when the Group recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits, if earlier. Gains or losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised when the settlement occurs. Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are split into three categories: ----- SYNLAB AG - service cost, which includes current service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements; - net interest expense or income; and - remeasurements. The Group recognises service cost within profit or loss as payroll-related expenses (see Note 8). Net interest expense or income is recognised within finance costs (see Note 13). The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the deficit or surplus in the Group’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans. Details of the assumptions used are included in Note 27 to the financial statements. A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of the termination benefit and when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs. Discretionary contributions made by employees or third parties reduce service cost upon payment of these contributions to the plan. When the formal terms of the plans specify that there will be contributions from employees or third parties, the accounting treatment depends on whether the contributions are linked to service, as follows: - If the contributions are not linked to service, they are reflected in the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability (asset). - If contributions are linked to service, they reduce service cost. ###### TAXATION #### Current income taxes The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement of income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it also excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The Group adopted IFRIC 23. IFRIC 23 sets out how to determine the accounting tax position when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. The Interpretation requires the Group to: - Determine whether uncertain tax positions are assessed separately or as a group; and - Assess whether it is probable that a tax authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment used, or proposed to be used, by an entity in its income tax filings: `o` If yes, the Group should determine its accounting tax position consistently with the tax treatment used or planned to be used in its income tax filings. `o` If no, the Group should reflect the effect of uncertainty in determining its accounting tax position using either the most likely amount or the expected value method. #### Deferred tax According to IAS 12 the balance sheet liability method is used for deferred tax accounting. Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated statement of financial position, and for tax losses and interest carryforwards Deferred tax liabilities are ----- SYNLAB AG generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group can control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled, or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the way the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. In accordance with IAS 12, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. #### Current tax and deferred tax for the year Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination. #### Value-added tax (VAT) Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated VAT, unless the VAT incurred is not recoverable from the taxation authority. The main SYNLAB Group activities being related to medical services are exempt from VAT in most of the countries in which the Group operates. In this case the Group cannot recover VAT applicable to charges and expenses relating to those VAT exempt activities and it is recognised as part of the cost of the acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense. In the case of Group companies for which partial reimbursement of VAT is possible, the non-reimbursable portion of VAT is not deducted. The VAT amount to be refunded by or paid to the tax authority is recognised in the statement of financial position under “Other current assets” or under “Other liabilities”. ----- SYNLAB AG ###### PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset, and subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment. If material parts of property, plant and equipment must be replaced at regular intervals or have different useful lives, the Group capitalises such parts as separate assets (major components) with specific useful lives or depreciation periods. Other maintenance and repair costs are recorded in profit or loss. The net present value of expected costs for disposal of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the criteria for recognition have been fulfilled. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when the asset is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognised net within other operating income in profit or loss. ###### DEPRECIATION Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimates accounted for on a prospective basis. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows: - Land and buildings: 15 to 50 years - Technical machines and equipment: 3 to 10 years - Vehicle fleet: 3 to 7 years - Other fixed assets: 2 to 10 years ###### INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets are recognised for the first time at acquisition cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is calculated as the fair value on the date of acquisition. Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets with finite useful lives acquired separately or in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is charged to the statement of income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. ----- SYNLAB AG The estimated useful lives are as follows: - Customer relationships: 3 to 25 years - Trademark (own brand): indefinite - Property rights and similar rights: 3 to 6 years - Software: 1 to 7 years Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. An internally generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) is recognised if, and only if certain conditions have been demonstrated. Expenditure on software development is capitalised when it is probable that the project will, after considering its commercial and technical feasibility, be completed and generate future economic benefits and the costs can be measured reliably. During the initial purchase price allocation when setting up the SYNLAB Group, the SYNLAB brand was identified as an intangible asset by the acquirer, SYNLAB Limited, which was an independent third party in this process, at that time. As the SYNLAB brand has existed since the creation of the company in 1998, and as SYNLAB is the largest European laboratory operator with a global presence, an indefinite useful life has been retained. The amount initially recognised for internally generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, internally generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately. Intangible assets are derecognised either upon disposal or when no economic benefits are expected to flow from further use or from the disposal of the recognised asset. Profit or loss arising from the derecognition of the asset are recorded in the statement of income as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset in the period in which the asset is derecognised. ###### IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of the fair value of an asset or a cash-generating unit (CGU) less cost of sale and the value in use. The recoverable amount must be determined for each individual asset unless a particular asset does not generate any cash flows that are largely independent of other assets or other groups of assets, in which case the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs. If the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its respective recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and is reduced to the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease. Value in use is the net present value of future expected cash flows using a discount rate before tax that reflects market expectations with respect to the interest rate effect and the specific risk of the asset. Recent market transactions, if applicable, are taken into consideration when determining the fair value less any cost of sale. If there are no such ----- SYNLAB AG identifiable transactions, a suitable valuation model is used. This is based on valuation multiples or other available indicators of fair value. Assets other than goodwill are assessed at every reporting date to determine whether there are indications that a previously recorded impairment loss no longer exists or has been reduced. If such indications are present, the Group assesses the recoverable value of the asset or the CGU. Any previously recorded impairment losses are only reversed if a change in the assumptions that formed the basis for the determination of the recoverable amount has taken place since recording the last impairment loss. The impairment reversal is limited by the fact that the carrying amount of an asset may exceed neither its recoverable amount nor the carrying value that would have remained after scheduled depreciation if in prior years no impairment losses for the asset had been recorded. ###### INVENTORIES Inventories consist of raw materials (“reagents”) and consumables and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. ###### FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. ###### FINANCIAL ASSETS Ordinary purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace. All recognised financial assets are measured subsequently in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets. Classification of financial assets Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are measured subsequently at amortised cost: - the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and - the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. ----- SYNLAB AG The Group has an immaterial amount of debt financial assets that are recognised at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). By default, all other financial assets are measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). 1) Amortised cost and effective interest method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. For financial assets, the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts), excluding expected credit losses, through the expected life of the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the gross carrying amount of the debt instrument on initial recognition. The amortised cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any loss allowance. Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method for debt instruments measured subsequently at amortised cost. Interest income is recognised in profit or loss and is included in the ""net finance costs – interest income"" line item. For these financial instruments, the Group measures the loss allowance equal to the 12-month expected credit losses, as there has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. 2) Financial assets at FVPL Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortised cost, are subsequently measured at FVTPL and are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any fair value gains or losses recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss includes any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset. Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 33. A financial asset is held for trading if: - it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling it in the near term; or - on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and for which the Group has evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or - it is a derivative (except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging instrument). Financial assets are categorised into current and non-current assets in the consolidated statement of financial position. Current financial assets comprise: - financial assets with a settlement or maturity date within 12 months of the statement of financial position date. ----- SYNLAB AG #### Equity instruments Equity instruments designated as at FVTOCI On initial recognition, the Group may make an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to designate investments in equity instruments as at FVTOCI. Designation at FVTOCI is not permitted if the equity investment is held for trading or if it is contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination. Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative gain or loss is not to be reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the equity investments, instead, it is transferred to retained earnings. Dividends on these investments in equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9, unless the dividends clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Dividends are included in the “finance income” line item (Note 12) in profit or loss. The Group has designated all investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading as at FVTOCI. #### Impairment of financial assets The Group has adopted the simplified expected credit loss model for its trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade accounts receivable have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. Moreover, reasonable and supportable information (if available without undue cost or effort) at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions have been taken into account in the calculations. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument. The Group writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, such as when the debtor has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings. Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Group’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised in profit or loss. Definition of default The Group considers the following as constituting an event of default for internal credit risk management purposes, as historical experience indicates that financial assets that meet either of the following criteria are generally not recoverable: - information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its creditors, including the Group, in full (without taking into account any collateral held by the Group). The Group writes off a trade receivable only when the trade receivable is uncollectable and there is information indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, such as when the debtor has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings. Other overdue trade receivables are not considered written off, since there is, in fact, no risk of default and only a risk of late payment. In general, there are longer payment settlement periods for trade receivables, as the business partners are commonly ----- SYNLAB AG represented by institutional organisations such as public and private hospitals, public health insurance funds and public health agencies. Payments are generally secured in terms of contract arrangements. Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is more than 90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate. #### Derecognition of financial assets The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortised cost, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognised in profit or loss. On derecognition of an investment measured at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the investment revaluation reserve is not reclassified to profit or loss, but is transferred to retained earnings. ###### FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. #### Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method or at FVTPL. Financial liabilities include borrowings, trade and other payables, derivative financial instruments and other financial liabilities. Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the liability is (i) contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business combination, (ii) held for trading or (iii) designated as at FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as held for trading if it has been acquired principally for the purpose of repurchasing it in the near term, or on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short-term profit; or it is a derivative, except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee or a designated and effective hedging instrument. All other financial liabilities are held at amortised cost. Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL are measured at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability. Financial liabilities that do not meet the criteria to be FVTPL are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. On initial recognition, any issue or redemption premiums and discounts and issuing costs are added to or deducted from the nominal value of the borrowings concerned. These items are taken into account when calculating the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts ----- SYNLAB AG estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. Financial liabilities are categorised into current and non-current liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position. Current financial liabilities comprise: - financial liabilities with a settlement or maturity date within 12 months of the statement of financial position date; and - financial liabilities in respect of which the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the statement of financial position date. #### Derecognition of a financial liability The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss. #### Derivative financial instruments The Group may enter into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset, whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability. Derivatives are not offset in the financial statements unless the Group has both the legal right and intention to offset them. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities. The Group does not apply any hedge accounting. #### Embedded derivatives An embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid contract that also includes a non-derivative host – with the effect that some of the cash flows of the combined instrument vary in a way similar to a stand-alone derivative. Derivatives embedded in hybrid contracts with a financial asset host within the scope of IFRS 9 are not separated. The entire hybrid contract is classified and subsequently measured at either amortised cost or fair value as appropriate. Derivatives embedded in hybrid contracts with hosts that are not financial assets within the scope of IFRS 9 (e.g. financial liabilities) are treated as separate derivatives when they meet the definition of a derivative, their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts, and the host contracts are not measured at fair value. An embedded derivative is presented as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the hybrid instrument to which the embedded derivative relates is more than 12 months and is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. ----- SYNLAB AG ###### CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, bank current accounts, and other bank deposits and short-term investments considered to be readily convertible into a known amount of cash and where the risk of a change in their value is deemed to be negligible based on the criteria set out in IAS 7. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are recorded under “Short-term borrowings” but included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. ###### PROVISIONS A provision is recognised if the Group has a present (legal or constructive) obligation arising from a past event, expenditure of resources with an economic benefit to fulfil the obligation is likely, and a reliable assessment of the amount of the obligation is possible. If an accrued liability is expected to be reimbursed at least in part (e.g. liabilities covered under an insurance policy), the reimbursement is classified as a separate asset, provided that there is a high probability of it occurring. The expense for such a provision is reported in the consolidated statement of income less any reimbursement. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, the carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material for a cash outflow after more than one year). Discount rates reflect current assessments of the time value of money and risks that are specific to the liability and not included in expected cash flows. The unwinding of the discount is recorded as finance costs. A provision for restructuring is only recognised when the Group has a formalised restructuring plan setting out detailed requirements regarding the business unit or part of the business unit concerned, the site and the number of employees concerned, as well as a detailed estimate of associated cost and a reasonable time schedule. The employees concerned must justifiably expect that the restructuring will take place, or it must have already begun. ###### SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS Share-based payment arrangements in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions, regardless of how the equity instruments are obtained by the Group. The expenses also include any social charges to be paid on the shares granted. For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the goods or services acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the liability. At reporting date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the year. Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. Fair value is determined using a suitable option pricing model. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-based transactions are set out in Note 27, Share-based payments. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised ----- SYNLAB AG in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves. This vesting period ends at the first possibility to exercise the option (i.e. when the employee concerned is irrevocably entitled to exercise the option). The cumulative expenses recorded for equity-settled share-based payment transactions thereby reflect, at any reporting date up to the date of first possibility of exercising the option, the vesting period already expired as well as the number of equity instruments which, based on the best estimate of management, will eventually vest. However, the amount by which the Group’s income is reduced or increased reflects the change in cumulative expenses reported at the beginning versus the end of the reporting period. Forfeited equity instruments granted for remuneration are not recorded as expense. An exception is granted for equity instruments granted for which non-forfeitability is based on certain market or non-vesting conditions. These equity instruments granted are deemed to be exercisable regardless of whether the market or non-vesting conditions are fulfilled, as long as all performance and service conditions have been fulfilled. If the underlying conditions of an equity-settled share-based payment transaction are changed, expenses are recorded in the minimum amount of costs that would have been incurred if contractual conditions had not been changed, provided that the original conditions of the remuneration agreement are fulfilled. The Company also records the effect of changes that increase the fair value of the share-based payment or are related to any other benefit for the employee, valued at the date of the change. If an equity-settled share-based payment agreement is cancelled, this is treated as if the option had been exercised on the day of cancellation. Expenditure not yet recognised is recorded immediately. This applies to all remuneration agreements for which non-vesting conditions on which either the Company or the employee have an influence have not been fulfilled. However, if the cancelled remuneration agreement, either equity or cash-settled, is replaced by another remuneration agreement declared on the day it is granted as replacement for the cancelled remuneration agreement, the cancelled agreement and the new remuneration agreement are recorded as a change to the original remuneration agreement with an impact limited to the incremental fair value granted, if any, during replacement. ###### NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN PARTNERSHIPS/PUT OPTIONS Pursuant to the rules prescribed by IAS 32, non-controlling interests in partnerships for which minority partners have a right of termination are recorded as a liability. In the same manner, shares for which the minority shareholders have been granted a put option by the majority partner are to be recognised at the fair value of the purchase price as an obligation. If this is done for a business combination, the business combination is accounted for as if the non-controlling interests had already been acquired. As a result, goodwill is recognised in full. Such shares are shown on the Group statement of financial position as a liability under “Other liabilities”. Income from these shares which can be withdrawn by the minority partner is shown in the consolidated statement of income in “Other financial expenses”. ###### ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT In the analysis of the Group’s operating results, we present certain non-IFRS measures as (i) they are used by management to measure operating performance, in presentations to our board members, and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting, and (ii) they represent similar measures that are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other parties as supplemental measures of performance. These measures enhance management’s and investors’ understanding of our financial performance by excluding items that are outside of ongoing operations such as acquisition-related costs including integration costs, strategic project costs (e.g. the IPO in 2021), impairment and reversal of impairment of non-operational assets, income taxes and costs of capital. ----- SYNLAB AG We believe that adjusted operating profit is widely used by investors to measure our operating performance and can vary substantially from company to company depending on the accounting methods, book value of assets and capital structure or method by which assets were acquired. This adjusted measure eliminates potential differences in performance caused by variations in capital structures (affecting net finance costs), tax positions (such as the availability of net operating losses against which to relieve taxable profits), the cost and age of tangible assets (affecting relative depreciation expense) and the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable (affecting relative amortisation expense). This adjusted measure also eliminates the effect of additional specific items that are considered to hinder comparison of the trading performance of our business year on year. However, non-IFRS measures are not measures or adjustments determined based on IFRS or any other internationally accepted accounting principles, and such items should not be considered as an alternative to the historical financial results or other indicators of our performance based on IFRS measures. Due to differences in the way our non-IFRS measure is calculated, the non-IFRS measure, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as presented by other companies. Even though non-IFRS measures are used by management to assess ongoing operating performance and these types of measures are commonly used by investors, they have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of SYNLAB’s results as reported under IFRS. In calculating adjusted operating profit certain items are added back. Adjusted Operating Profit - Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) - Share of loss of associates and other non-controlling interest - Acquisition and integration-related costs - Other non-recurring costs from strategic projects (see Note 5) - Less depreciation and amortisation of all items, except for amortisation of customer relationships Adjusted operating profit is the Group’s segment performance measure and has therefore been disclosed in Note 5. ###### SEGMENT INFORMATION In accordance with IFRS 8, the reportable segments are components of the Group that engage in business activities and whose operating results based on the internal reporting are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decisionmaker. Segment performance is mainly assessed based on total revenue and adjusted operating profit and is measured in line with the statement of income in the consolidated financial statements. All costs initially borne by the head office are allocated to those segments when directly attributable. General costs are assigned to the segments on a revenue basis, whereas costs with a closer relationship to single segments are allocated on a case-by-case scenario. The Group’s financing (including finance costs and finance income) and income taxes are centrally managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. This is the basis on which internal reports are provided to the chief operating decision-maker for assessing performance and determining the allocation of resources within the Group. ----- SYNLAB AG ###### DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUES A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the three-level fair value hierarchy. For assets or liabilities repeatedly reported in the financial statements, the Group determines any hierarchy level reclassification by re-evaluating the existing classification at the end of each reporting period. Such revaluation is based on the lowest-level input parameters which are essential for fair value measurement. #### Property, plant and equipment The fair value of property, plant and equipment recognised as a result of a business combination is based on market values. The market value of property is the estimated amount that would be received to sell a property in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of items of plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings is based on the market approach and cost approaches using quoted recent market prices for similar items when available and current replacement cost when appropriate. #### Trade and other receivables The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. The net carrying value is considered as a reasonable estimate of their fair value considering the short payment and settlement periods applied by the Group. This fair value is determined for disclosure purposes. #### Derivatives The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on broker quotes. Those quotes are tested for reasonableness on an ad hoc basis by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates for a similar instrument at the measurement date. Fair values also reflect the credit risk of the instrument and include adjustments to take account of the credit risk of the Group entity and counterparty when appropriate. #### Non-derivative financial liabilities Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. #### Share-based payment transactions The fair value of employee share options is generally measured using a binomial lattice model. Measurement inputs include the share price on the measurement date, the exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historic volatility of similar quoted entities), the weighted average expected life of the instruments (based on historical experience and general option holder behaviour), expected dividends and the risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the transactions are not taken into account in determining fair value. ----- SYNLAB AG",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity (attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate). Differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity. On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, or a partial disposal of an interest in a joint arrangement or an associate that includes a foreign operation of which the retained interest becomes a financial asset), all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the Company are reclassified to profit or loss. ###### FINANCE INCOME AND FINANCE COSTS Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested, dividend income, gains on hedging instruments that are recognised at fair value in profit or loss and foreign currency gains. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date that the Group’s right to receive payment is established. ----- SYNLAB AG Finance costs comprise the cost of net debt and other financial expenses. Cost of net debt includes interest expense on borrowings and financial leases, as well as expenses related to derivatives. Other financial expenses mainly include unwinding of the discount on provisions. Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. The Group does not own any qualifying assets. ###### RETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS Depending on the laws and practices in force in the countries where the Group operates, Group companies have legal obligations in terms of pensions, early retirement payments and retirement bonuses. Such obligations are generally state defined contribution plans, but the Group is also affected by post-employment or post-retirement employees’ benefits. Defined contribution plans Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions. Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit plans are accounted for as payments to defined contribution plans where the Group’s obligations under the plans are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan. Defined benefit plans and similar obligations For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. Remeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest) are recognised immediately in the statement of financial position with a charge or credit to other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements recognized in other comprehensive income are not reclassified. Past service cost is recognised in profit or loss when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs, or when the Group recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits, if earlier. Gains or losses on settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised when the settlement occurs. Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are split into three categories: - service costs, which includes current service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements; - net interest expense or income; and - remeasurements. The Group recognises service costs within profit or loss as payroll related expenses (see note 8). Net interest expense or income is recognised within finance costs (see note 13). The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the deficit or surplus in the Group’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans. Details of the assumptions used are included in note 27 to the financial statements. A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of the termination benefit and when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs. Discretionary contributions made by employees or third parties reduce service cost upon payment of these contributions to the plan. When the formal terms of the plans specify that there will be contributions from employees or third parties, the accounting depends on whether the contributions are linked to service, as follows: ----- SYNLAB AG - If the contributions are not linked to services they are reflected in the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability (asset). - If contributions are linked to services, they reduce service costs. ###### TAXATION Current income taxes The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The Group adopted IFRIC 23. IFRIC 23 sets out how to determine the accounting tax position when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. The Interpretation requires the Group to: - Determine whether uncertain tax positions are assessed separately or as a group; and - Assess whether it is probable that a tax authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment used, or proposed to be used, by an entity in its income tax filings: `o` If yes, the Group should determine its accounting tax position consistently with the tax treatment used or planned to be used in its income tax filings. `o` If no, the Group should reflect the effect of uncertainty in determining its accounting tax position using either the most likely amount or the expected value method. Deferred tax According to IAS 12 the balance sheet liability method is used for deferred tax accounting. Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated statement of financial position, and for tax losses and interest carryforwards Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group can control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. ----- SYNLAB AG Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled, or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the way the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. In accordance with IAS 12, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. Current tax and deferred tax for the year Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination. Value-added tax (VAT) Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated VAT, unless the VAT incurred is not recoverable from the taxation authority. The main SYNLAB Group activities being related to medical services are exempt from VAT in most of the countries in which the Group operates. In this case the Group cannot recover VAT applicable to charges and expenses relating to those VAT exempt activities and it is recognised as part of the cost of the acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense. In the case of Group companies for which partial reimbursement of VAT is possible, the non-reimbursable portion of VAT is not deducted. The VAT amount to be refunded by or paid to the tax authority is recognised in the statement of financial position under “Other current assets” or under “Other liabilities”. ###### PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment. If material parts of property, plant and equipment must be replaced at regular intervals or have different useful lives, the Group capitalises such parts as separate assets (major components) with specific useful lives or depreciation periods. Other maintenance and repair costs are recorded in profit or loss. The net present value of expected costs for disposal of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the criteria for recognition have been fulfilled. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when the asset is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognised net within other operating income in profit or loss. ----- SYNLAB AG ###### DEPRECIATION Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows: - Land and buildings 15 to 30 years; - Technical machines and equipment 3 to 10 years; - Vehicle fleet 3 to 5 years; and - Other fixed assets 2 to 10 years. ###### INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets are recognised for the first time at acquisition cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is calculated as the fair value at date of acquisition. Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets with finite useful lives acquired separately or in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows: - Customer relationships 3 to 25 years; - Trademarks 1 to 10 years; - Trademark (own brand) indefinite; - Property rights and similar rights 3 to 6 years; and - Software 1 to 7 years. Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. An internallygenerated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) is recognised if, and only if certain conditions have been demonstrated. Expenditure on software development is capitalised when it is probable that the project will, after considering its commercial and technical feasibility, be completed and generate future economic benefits and the costs can be measured reliably. During the initial purchase price allocation when setting up the SYNLAB Group, the SYNLAB brand was identified as an intangible asset by the acquirer SYNLAB Limited, which was an independent 3[rd] party in this process, at that time. As the SYNLAB brand exists since the creation of the company in 1998 and SYNLAB is the largest European laboratory operator with a global presence, an indefinite useful life has been retained. The amount initially recognised for internally-generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it is ----- SYNLAB AG incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, internally-generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately. Intangible assets are derecognised either upon disposal or when no economic benefits are expected to flow from further use or from the disposal of the recognised asset. Profit or loss arising from the derecognition of the asset are recorded in the income statement as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset in the period in which the asset is derecognised. ###### IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of the fair value of an asset or a cash generating (“CGU”) unit less cost of sale and the value-in-use. The recoverable amount must be determined for each individual asset unless a particular asset does not generate any cash flows that are largely independent of other assets or other groups of assets, in which case, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs. If the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its respective recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and is reduced to recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease. Value-in-use is the net present value of future expected cash flows using a discount rate before tax that reflects market expectations with respect to the interest rate effect and the specific risk of the asset. Recent market transactions, if applicable, are taken into consideration when determining the fair value less any cost of sale. If there are no such identifiable transactions, a suitable valuation model is used. This is based on valuation multiples or other available indicators of fair value. Assets other than goodwill are assessed at every reporting date as to whether there are indications that a previously recorded impairment loss no longer exists or has been reduced. If such indications are present, the Group assesses the recoverable value of the asset or the CGU. Any previously recorded impairment losses are only reversed if a change in the assumptions that formed the basis for the determination of the recoverable amount has taken place since recording the last impairment loss. The impairment reversal is limited by the fact that the carrying amount of an asset may neither exceed its recoverable amount nor the carrying value that would have remained after scheduled depreciation if in previous years no impairment losses for the asset had been recorded. ###### INVENTORIES Inventories consist of raw materials (“reagents”) and consumables and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. ###### FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. ----- SYNLAB AG Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. ###### FINANCIAL ASSETS Ordinary purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace. All recognised financial assets are measured subsequently in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets. Classification of financial assets Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are measured subsequently at amortised cost: - The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The Group has an immaterial amount of debt financial assets that are recognised as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). By default, all other financial assets are measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). 1) Amortised cost and effective interest method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. For financial assets the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) excluding expected credit losses, through the expected life of the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the gross carrying amount of the debt instrument on initial recognition. The amortised cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any loss allowance. Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method for debt instruments measured subsequently at amortised cost. Interest income is recognised in profit or loss and is included in the ""net finance costs – interest income"" line item. For these financial instruments, the Group measures the loss allowance equal to the 12 month expected credit losses, as there has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. ----- SYNLAB AG 2) Financial assets at FVPL Financial assets, that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortised cost, are subsequently measured at FVTPL and are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any fair value gains or losses recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss includes any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset. Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 32. A financial asset is held for trading if: - It has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling it in the near term; or - On initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and has evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or It is a derivative (except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging instrument). Financial assets are categorised into current and non-current assets in the consolidated statement of financial position. Current financial assets comprise: - Financial assets with a settlement or maturity date within 12 months of the statement of financial position date Equity instruments Equity instruments designated as at FVTOCI On initial recognition, the Group may make an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to designate investments in equity instruments as at FVTOCI. Designation at FVTOCI is not permitted if the equity investment is held for trading or if it is contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination. Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income. The cumulative gain or loss is not be reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the equity investments, instead, it is transferred to retained earnings. Dividends on these investments in equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9, unless the dividends clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Dividends are included in the ‘finance income’ line item (Note 12) in profit or loss. The Group has designated all investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading as at FVTOCI. Impairment of financial assets The Group has adopted the simplified expected credit loss model for its trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade accounts receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. Moreover, reasonable and supportable information (if available without undue cost or effort) at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions have been taken into account ----- SYNLAB AG in the calculations. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument. The Group writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, e.g. when the debtor has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings. Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Group’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised in profit or loss. Definition of default The Group considers the following as constituting an event of default for internal credit risk management purposes as historical experience indicates that financial assets that meet either of the following criteria are generally not recoverable: - Information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its creditors, including the Group, in full (without taking into account any collateral held by the Group). The Group writes off a trade receivable only when the trade receivable is uncollectable and there is information indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, e.g. when the debtor has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings. Other overdue trade receivables are not considered written-off, since there is, in fact, no risk of default and only a risk of late payment. In general, there are longer payment settlement periods for trade receivables, as the business partners are commonly represented by institutional organizations such as public and private hospitals, public health insurance funds and public health agencies. Payments are generally secured in terms of contract arrangements. Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is more than 90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate. Derecognition of financial assets The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortised cost, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognised in profit or loss. On derecognition of an investment in equity instrument which the Group has elected on initial recognition to measure at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the investments revaluation reserve is not reclassified to profit or loss, but is transferred to retained earnings. ###### FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. ----- SYNLAB AG Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method or at FVTPL. Financial liabilities include borrowings, trade and other payables, derivative financial instruments and other financial liabilities. Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the liability is (i) contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business combination, (ii) held for trading or (iii) it is designated as FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as held for trading if it has been acquired principally for the purpose of repurchasing it in the near term, or on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short-term profit, or it is a derivative, except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee or a designated and effective hedging instrument. All other financial liabilities are held at amortised cost. Financial liabilities measured at FVTPL are measured at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in the profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability. Financial liabilities that do not meet the criteria to be FVTPL are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. On initial recognition, any issue or redemption premiums and discounts and issuing costs are added to/deducted from the nominal value of the borrowings concerned. These items are taken into account when calculating the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. Financial liabilities are categorised into current and non-current liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position. Current financial liabilities comprise: - Financial liabilities with a settlement or maturity date within 12 months of the statement of financial position date; and - Financial liabilities in respect of which the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the statement of financial position date. Derecognition of a financial liability The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss. Derivative financial instruments The Group may enter into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. ----- SYNLAB AG A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability. Derivatives are not offset in the financial statements unless the Group has both legal right and intention to offset. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities. The Group does not apply any hedge accounting. _Embedded derivatives_ An embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid contract that also includes a non-derivative host – with the effect that some of the cash flows of the combined instrument vary in a way similar to a stand-alone derivative. Derivatives embedded in hybrid contracts with a financial asset host within the scope of IFRS 9 are not separated. The entire hybrid contract is classified and subsequently measured as either amortised cost or fair value as appropriate. Derivatives embedded in hybrid contracts with hosts that are not financial assets within the scope of IFRS 9 (e.g. financial liabilities) are treated as separate derivatives when they meet the definition of a derivative, their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not measured at fair value. An embedded derivative is presented as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the hybrid instrument to which the embedded derivative relates is more than 12 months and is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. ###### CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, bank current accounts, and other bank deposits and short-term investments considered to be readily convertible into a known amount of cash and where the risk of a change in their value is deemed to be negligible based on the criteria set out in IAS 7. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of Group’s cash management are recorded under “Short-term borrowings” but included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. ###### PROVISIONS A provision is recognised if the Group has a present (legal or constructive) obligation arising from a past event, expenditure of resources with economic benefit to fulfil the obligation is likely, and a reliable assessment of the amount of the obligation is possible. If an accrued liability is expected to be reimbursed at least in part (e.g. liabilities covered under an insurance policy), the reimbursement is classified as a separate asset, provided there is a high probability of it occurring. The expense for such a provision is reported in the consolidated statement of income less any reimbursement. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material for a cash outflow after more than one year). Discount rates reflect current assessments of the time value of money and risks that are specific to the liability and not included in expected cash flows. The unwinding of the discount is recorded as finance costs. ----- SYNLAB AG A provision for restructuring is only recognised when the Group has a formalised restructuring plan setting out detailed requirements regarding the business unit or part of the business unit concerned, the site and the number of employees concerned, as well as a detailed estimate of associated cost and a reasonable time schedule. The employees concerned must justifiably expect that the restructuring will take place, or it must have already begun. ###### SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS Share-based payment arrangements in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions, regardless of how the equity instruments are obtained by the Group. The expenses also include any social charges to be paid on the shares granted. For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the goods or services acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the liability. At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the year. Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. Fair value is determined using a suitable option pricing model. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-based transactions are set out in Note 27, Share-based payments. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves. This vesting period ends at the first possibility to exercise the option, that is, when the employee concerned is irrevocably entitled to exercise the option. The cumulative expenses recorded for equity-settled share-based payment transactions thereby reflect at any reporting date up to the date of first possibility of exercising the option the vesting period already expired as well as the number of equity instruments which, based on the best estimate of management, will eventually vest. However, the amount by which the Group's income is reduced or increased reflects the change in cumulative expenses reported at the beginning versus the end of the reporting period. Forfeited equity instruments granted for remuneration are not recorded as expense. An exception is equity instruments granted for which non-forfeitability is based on certain market or non-vesting conditions. These equity instruments granted are deemed to be exercisable regardless of whether the market or non-vesting conditions are fulfilled, as long as all performance and service conditions have been fulfilled. If the underlying conditions of an equity-settled share-based payment transaction are changed, expenses are recorded in the minimum amount of costs that would have been incurred if contractual conditions had not been changed, provided that the original conditions of the remuneration agreement are fulfilled. The Company also records the effect of changes that increase the fair value of the share-based payment or are related to any other benefit for the employee, valued at the date of the change. If an equity-settled share-based payment agreement is cancelled, this is treated as if the option had been exercised on the day of cancellation. Expenditure not yet recognised is recorded immediately. This applies to all remuneration agreements for which non-vesting conditions on which either the Company or the employee have an influence have not been fulfilled. However, if the cancelled remuneration agreement, either equity or cash-settled is replaced by ----- SYNLAB AG another remuneration agreement declared on the day it is granted as replacement for the cancelled remuneration agreement, the cancelled agreement and the new remuneration agreement are recorded as a change to the original remuneration agreement with an impact limited to the incremental fair value granted, if any, during replacement. ###### NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN PARTNERSHIPS/PUT OPTIONS Pursuant to the rules prescribed by IAS 32, non-controlling interests in partnerships for which minority partners have a right of termination are recorded as a liability. In the same manner, shares for which the minority shareholders has been granted a put option by the majority partner are to be recognised at the fair value of the purchase price as an obligation. If this is done for a business combination, the business combination is accounted for as if the non-controlling interests had already been acquired. As a result, goodwill is recognised in full. Such shares are shown on the Group statement of financial position as a liability under “Other liabilities”. Income from these shares which can be withdrawn by the minority partner is shown in the consolidated statement of income in “Other financial expenses”. ###### ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT In the analysis of the Group’s operating results, we present certain non-IFRS measures as (i) they are used by management to measure operating performance, in presentations to our board members, and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting, and (ii) they represent similar measures that are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other parties as supplemental measures of performance. These measures enhance management's and investors' understanding of our financial performance by excluding items that are outside of ongoing operations such as acquisition related costs including integration costs, strategic project costs (e.g. the IPO in 2021), impairment and reversal of impairment of non-operational assets, income taxes and costs of capital. We believe that Adjusted Operating Profit is widely used by investors to measure our operating performance and can vary substantially from company to company depending on the accounting methods, book value of assets and capital structure or method by which assets were acquired. This adjusted measures eliminates potential differences in performance caused by variations in capital structures (affecting net finance costs), tax positions (such as the availability of net operating losses against which to relieve taxable profits), the cost and age of tangible assets (affecting relative depreciation expense) and the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable (affecting relative amortization expense). This adjusted measure also eliminates the effect of additional specific items that are considered to hinder comparison of the trading performance of our business year-on-year. However, non-IFRS measures are not measures or adjustments determined based on IFRS or any other internationally accepted accounting principles, and you should not consider such items as an alternative to the historical financial results or other indicators of our performance based on IFRS measures. The non-IFRS measure, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as presented by other companies due to differences in the way our non-IFRS measure is calculated. Even though non-IFRS measures are used by management to assess ongoing operating performance and these types of measures are commonly used by investors, they have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of SYNLAB's results as reported under IFRS. In calculating Adjusted Operating Profit certain items are added back Adjusted Operating Profit - Earnings before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation/Amortization/Impairment (EBITDA) - Share of loss of associates and other non-controlling interest - Acquisition and integration related costs ----- SYNLAB AG - Other non-recurring costs from strategic projects (see Note5) - Less depreciation and amortization on all items, except for amortization on customer relationships Adjusted Operating Profit is the group’s segmental performance measure and has therefore been disclosed in Note 5. ###### SEGMENT INFORMATION In accordance with IFRS 8, the reportable segments are components of the Group that engage in business activities and whose operating results based on the internal reporting are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decisionmaker. Segment performance is mainly assessed based on total revenue and adjusted operating profit and is measured consistently with the statement of income in the consolidated financial statements. All costs initially borne by head office are allocated to those segments when directly attributable. General costs are assigned to the segments on a revenue basis, costs with a closer relation to single segments are allocated on a case by case scenario. The Group’s financing (including finance costs and finance income) and income taxes are centrally managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. This is the basis on which internal reports are provided to the chief operating decision-maker for assessing performance and determining the allocation of resources within the Group. ###### DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUES A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the three-level fair value hierarchy. For assets or liabilities repeatedly reported in the financial statements the Group determines any hierarchy level reclassification by re-evaluating the existing classification at the end of each reporting period. Such revaluation is based on the lowest-level input parameters which are essential for fair value measurement. Property, plant and equipment The fair value of property, plant and equipment recognised as a result of a business combination is based on market values. The market value of property is the estimated amount that would be received to sell a property in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of items of plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings is based on the market approach and cost approaches using quoted recent market prices for similar items when available and current replacement cost when appropriate. Trade and other receivables The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. The net carrying value is considered as a reasonable estimate of their fair value considering the short payment and settlement periods applied by the Group. This fair value is determined for disclosure purposes. ----- SYNLAB AG Derivatives The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on broker quotes. Those quotes are tested for reasonableness on an adhoc basis by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates for a similar instrument at the measurement date. Fair values also reflect the credit risk of the instrument and include adjustments to take account of the credit risk of the Group entity and counterparty when appropriate. Non-derivative financial liabilities Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. Share-based payment transactions The fair value of employee share options is generally measured using a binomial lattice model. Measurement inputs include share price on measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historic volatility of similar quoted entities), weighted average expected life of the instruments (based on historical experience and general option holder behavior), expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the transactions are not taken into account in determining fair value. #### 4 Significant Events 4.1 Changes in scope of consolidation/increase in share holdings The following changes in the scope of consolidation occurred during the reporting period:",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The Group has continued its external growth strategy with several laboratory bolt-on acquisitions. A deal standalone would have been immaterial from the point of view of the group, so we have combined all other acquisitions. All acquisitions in the period earn revenues mainly from medical or pathology analyses. Through these acquisitions the Group expects to reduce costs through economies of scale, and the goodwill thus represents the fair value of the expected synergies resulting from the acquisitions. ----- SYNLAB AG",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

The CGUs and group of CGUs for the year ended 31 December 2021 are Germany, France, South and North & East.

The CGUs and group of CGUs in 2020 were Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, Iberia, LatAm, North, CEMEA. Therefore, the current CGUs and group of CGUs constellation was attained by means of aggregation of Italy, Switzerland, Iberia, LatAm into the group South and North, CEMEA into the group North & East.

This percentage is management’s best estimate of the inflationary growth effects based on the long-term inflation rates for each CGU. - In the terminal value, a sustainable growth in earnings must be taken into account in the form of a growth factor, which is deducted from the discount rate. The company has aligned its long term growth assumption on the average long term growth assumption for German companies (not only health care companies) after the transfer from a UK jurisdiction to a German jurisdiction during the financial year 2021. Studies in Germany have shown that the profit growth of German companies has not reached the level of inflation in the long term. On average, the profit growth was only 45% to 50% of the inflation rate. This leads to a reduction of the long term growth rates compared to the previous year with approximately 50%. - The discount rate is based on the respective CGU’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) including a leveraged beta, market risk premium, country risk premium and cost of debt. - Discount rates used are post-tax discount rates applied to post tax cash flows. Applying those rates result in value in use materially consistent to those computed using pre-tax discount rates applied to pre-tax cash flow. (as required by IAS 36). ###### RESULT OF ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING Based on the impairment test model calculation performed, no impairment needs to be recognized. ###### SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS A post-tax discount rate increase of 1% point would not lead to a goodwill impairment in any of the CGUs or group of CGUs, except for Germany, where it would lead to an impairment of 92 M€ being recognised. A 5% decrease in the forecasted EBITDA over the forecast’s horizon included in the terminal value would not lead to a goodwill impairment in any of the CGUs or group of CGUs, except for Germany, where it would lead to a goodwill impairment of 73M€ being recognised ----- SYNLAB AG #### 18.

Other types of temporary differences have been grouped into single categories of other deferred tax assets and liabilities. At the end of the financial year, there were loss and interest carryforwards totaling 507.6 M€, of which interest carryforwards amounted to 311.5 M€ (2020: 555.4 M€, of which interest carryforwards amounted to 380.3 M€). The recognition of these assets, and the non-recognition of assets in respect of tax losses, is based on SYNLAB's board's estimate of the probability of being able to use these losses (prior to the expiration of the losses), including consideration of current levels of utilisation, forecast operating results and the level of deferred tax liabilities recognized in the particular territory / tax grouping. Deferred Tax Assets totaling 2.4 M€ (2020: 3.4 M€) have been recognized on losses. Deferred tax assets have not been recognized in respect of losses of 186.8 M€ (2020: 161.6 M€), which are available for indefinite carry forward. These losses have arisen mainly in the UK, Spain, Germany and France. Losses can be utilised in the future if taxable profits continue to be consistent with current year levels. Whilst there is potential for the losses to be utilised against future taxable profits, no deferred tax asset is recognised on the basis that it is not probable that the entities will generate taxable profits in accordance with IAS 12. The Group has also previously incurred interest expense in excess of the maximum available to be offset against current profits in a number of territories. An amount of 311.5 M€ (2020: 381.0 M€) is available for indefinite carry forward depending on local regulations, primarily in Germany, Spain, and France. In addition, deferred tax assets totaling 1.6 M€ (2020: 1.1 M€) have been recognized on excess interest amounts in companies in France which are forecasting excess interest capacity. Deferred tax assets have not been recognized in respect of excess interest amounts of 305 M€ (2020: 376.3 M€) either because excess interest capacity is not currently forecasted for future periods or because the attributes are expected to be lost on a change in control before they can be utilized. At 31 December 2021, the retained earnings of subsidiaries consolidated by the group include 15.3 M€ of temporary differences on undistributed earnings that will be subject to tax if remitted to the shareholder company. Deferred tax liabilities of 4.1 M€ (2020: nil) were recognized in 2021 for planned dividend payments by subsidiaries within the foreseeable future. |Col1|Deferred tax assets|Deferred tax liabilities Total|Col4|Col5|Col6| |---|---|---|---|---|---| |€000|Tax losses and other deductible temporary differences|Deferred tax on intangible assets|Other deferred tax liabilities|Total deferred tax liabilities|Total net deferred tax| |As at 1 January 2021 Acquired through business combination (Charge)/credit to income (Charge)/credit to other comprehensive income Exchange differences As at 31 December 2021|29,017 3,568 9,881 (1,367) 648|(156,698) (9,286) 9,910 (1,488)|(14,940) (14,623) 1,871 (170)|(171,638) (9,286) (4,713) 1,871 (1,658)|(142,621) (5,718) 5,168 504 (1,010)| ||41,747|(157,562)|(27,862)|(185,424)|(143,677)| ----- SYNLAB AG The following are the major deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized by the Group and movements thereon during the prior year periods:",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Employee benefits liabilities Most of the Group’s employees are covered by state pension and collective plans managed by third parties if required under local legislation. Those plans are defined contribution plans. In addition to these legal pension schemes, a provision for pensions and other post-employment benefits is recorded in the IFRS consolidated statement of financial position as of 31 December 2021, 31 December 2020 based on an actuarial expert opinion for the following obligations: ###### OBLIGATIONS IN SWITZERLAND In general, employers in Switzerland must offer a pension plan to its employees in accordance with the Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors’, and Disability Pension Plans (BVG). Employees whose salary exceeds a particular threshold – which is redefined periodically – participate in the pension plan. The BVG requires a minimum plan, the ""BVG minimum"", which must be covered in any case. The Group’s pension plans in Switzerland are contribution-based plans with guarantee of a minimum interest credit and fixed conversion rates at retirement. The pension plans also provide benefits in case of disability and death. The Group as a sponsoring employer is affiliated to various collective foundations and fulfils the legal obligation by means of a defined benefit plan. Each collective foundation is responsible for the governance of the plan and the board is composed of an equal number of representatives from the employers and employees chosen from all affiliated companies. The pension plan must always be fully funded under BVG law on a static basis. The Group is exposed to the risk that in case of an underfunding, recovery measures must be taken which encompass additional financing through employer or reduction of benefits (or both). Such risk may occur in case when the life expectancy of plan participants is higher than expected. Furthermore, the underlying plan assets may develop differently than expected. The Group Pension obligations and ongoing service cost were calculated using the projected unit credit method, applying a discount rate of 0.35% (2020: 0.10%) and a salary increase rate of 1.20% (2020: 1.00%) p.a. Staff turnover assumptions is based on the demographic BVG 2020, (2020: BVG 2015). The individual values range from between 1.66% and 31.00% (2020: was between 1.23% and 29.59%). Mortality, disability, and withdrawal probabilities were calculated in accordance with the new demographic tables BVG 2020, CMI 1.25% (2020: BVG 2015). Long-services award commitments (“jubilee awards”) in Switzerland are based on collective or other agreements granting employees long-term claims depending on their remuneration levels and duration of service. Provisions for long-service awards were calculated applying a discount rate of 0.35% (2020: 0.10%), a salary increase rate of 1.20% (2020: 1.00%), and a staff turnover rate per BVG 2020 of between 1.23% and 29.59% (2020: BVG 2015 of between 1.23% and 29.59). ###### OBLIGATIONS IN FRANCE In France, the Group provides benefits in case of retirement, which are based on various collective bargaining agreements. The corresponding plans are mostly fully unfunded. The Group is exposed to the risk that the salary increase could be higher than expected. In France, the life expectancy is less important in terms of risk exposure given that the benefit is paid as a lump sum. Based on collective agreement, a payment is granted to staff when they retire depending on their remuneration levels and duration of service. Provisions were calculated based on following actuarial assumptions: voluntary departure, discount rate amounting to 1.10% (2020: 1.00%), inflation rate 2.00% (2020: 1.75%), salary increase between 2.00% ----- SYNLAB AG (2020: between 1.0% and 1,5%) p.a., age at retirement phased depending on birth date with a maximum of 65 years for employees and 67 years for executives; social charge rate 46.49% (2020: 46.49%) and low staff turnover rate. ###### OBLIGATIONS IN ITALY Pursuant to statutory regulations (Trattamento di Fine Rapporto, TFR), employees are entitled to a one-time severance payment when they leave the Company. The amounts depend on the employee’s term of service and salary level. Provisions were calculated based on following actuarial assumptions: discount rate of 1.00% (2020 0,85%), inflation rate 1.70% (2020: 0.70%) and salary increase 2.00% (2020: 2.00%) p.a. ###### OTHER OBLIGATIONS In certain other countries, there are legal obligations to make a one-time salary-based severance payment to a retiring employee (Austria, Ecuador) or when they leave the Company (United Arab Emirates, Mexico). The Group assumed also pension obligations from defined benefit plans for a few executive staff as a consequence of specific agreements in Ecuador, Germany, Netherlands, Norway and UK. The plans in the United Kingdom come from the Viapath acquisition. The defined benefits plan for Netherlands and Norway and some Austrian, Germans, Italian and Swiss defined benefits plans are included in our discontinued Note 15. ----- SYNLAB AG",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Share-based payment schemes SYNLAB AG has set up various long-term, share-based payment schemes for the SYNLAB Group in the financial year. These include the following programmes: - LTIP (long term incentive plan) for the Management Board / grant date: 1 May 2021 - LTIP for senior executives / grant date: 1 May 2021 - Virtual LTIP for employees / grant date: 1 July 2021 According to the terms and conditions of the various programmes, share-based commitments may in general be settled in cash or in shares of SYNLAB AG (settlement option). However, the Supervisory Board and the Management Board have determined in their respective resolutions that the settlement will be made through shares in SYNLAB AG. Consequently, all three programmes are treated as equity-settled. Share-based commitments may be forfeited if the beneficiary's employment ends before the end of the vesting period. The share-based commitments are subject to a vesting period of three to four years and grant an entitlement to compensation which the beneficiaries will receive after the vesting period without making a payment. LTIP for the Management Board The awards are granted in the form of Performance Share Units (PSU) and are linked to performance criteria. For the share awards granted in the past financial year, 40% of the target amount is linked to the development of SYNLAB's share price (Total Shareholder Return “TSR”) and 60% of the target amount is linked to SYNLAB's relative share development compared to the development of the MSCI Europe Health Care Equipment & Services sector index (TSR target). The range of target achievement of the individual performance criteria is from 0% to 300%. The vesting period is three years. The fair value of these entitlements was 2.05 M€ and was determined based on a Monte Carlo valuation model. The weighted average fair value of a PSU was 17,46 €. An expected volatility of 30.0% and a price of 19.75 € per SYNLAB share were used in this model. The expected volatility was derived from historical volatilities. A risk-free interest rate of 0.9% to - 0.6% and an expected dividend yield of 2.0% were used in the model. Assumptions on correlations between the SYNLAB share price and the development of the MSCI Index were determined on the basis of historical price developments. LTIP for senior executives The awards for senior executives are also linked to performance criteria. Both the determination or allocation of the target amount and the determination of the fair value are identical to the LTIP for the Management Board. However, the vesting period for this plan extends over four years. The fair value of these entitlements was 1.2 M€. The weighted average fair value of a PSU was also 17,46 €. Virtual LTIP for employees In the past financial year, 271,490 virtual share awards were granted to various employees of the SYNLAB Group. These are not linked to performance criteria but include a service criterion. The vesting period is four years. The fair value of these entitlements amounted to 4.9 M€ and was determined on the basis of a valuation model. The weighted ----- SYNLAB AG average fair value of a virtual share award was 19 €. A price of 17.95 € per SYNLAB share on the grant date, a riskfree interest rate of - 0.6% and an expected dividend yield of 2.0% were used in this model.

The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. This planning considers the maturity of both its financial assets, and its projected cash flow from operations. Typically, the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period of 60 days, including the servicing of financial obligations. In addition, the Group maintains a line of credit (Revolving Credit Facility) under which drawings could be made for financing acquisitions or for general financing purposes. Refer to Note 26 Borrowings and other financial liabilities for detail of maturities of financial indebtedness, as well as for a description of the covenants in place with the RCF agreement. Under these covenants, if the Group does not respect contractual requirements, it may result in preventing of future drawing on the undrawn facility. The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a systematic liquidity planning scheme. This scheme considers the maturity of its financial investments and assets and the projected cash flows from operations.

The Term Loan held by SYNLAB AG (TLA) bear floating interest at 1,25% for a nominal of 735 M€. The Group does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Due to the Group’s specific interest rate risk position based on floating rate funding structure, risk management policies require to monitor interest rate volatility. Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments On an annual basis, a 6M EURIBOR reference at 1% would have led to an overall additional payment of 14.4 M€ on the Term Loans. If the RCF would be drawn for its maximum amount of 475 M€, exposure to interest risk rate on financial liabilities would amount to a maximum of 4.75 M€ for an increase of variable interest rate of 100 basis points (over a EURIBOR zero reference). That limited exposure to interest rate risk on financial liabilities would be compensated by the positive effect on financial income generated by cash equivalents, which are mostly based on variable rate instruments. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant. At the beginning of 2022, the Group entered into a new interest rate hedging contract. Following this subsequent event, the interest rate risk for the Term Loans is decreasing and reducing the additional interest payment to 9.9 M€ in the case of a 6M EURIBOR reference at 1%. ###### MARKET RISK – FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Group has been exposed to limited foreign exchange risk, given the SYNLAB Group is mostly present in European countries which are part of the Eurozone, except for the UK operations which are exposed to foreign exchange risk in respect of the British pound, the Swiss operations which are exposed to Swiss francs, certain Northern or Eastern Europe countries and Rest of World cash generating unit.

Detailed quantitative information on credit risk are provided in Note 24 Trade accounts receivable. ###### TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risks due to the large numbers of customers and individually immateriality of amounts due. The Group has adopted the simplified expected credit loss model for its trade receivables. The Group always measures the loss allowance for trade receivables at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. To measure the expected credit losses, trade accounts receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The computation of expected credit losses is performed by means of a default risk matrix, which is based on the historical default rates grouped by trade receivables class and aging buckets.

The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by investing mainly in liquid securities with counterparties that have a high credit rating. Management actively monitors its investments and does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.

Fair value of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis Some of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. They consist mainly of shares and other securities <20%, call options on non-controlling interests with agreed price determination formula as well as contingent consideration recorded in a business combination (as detailed in Note 31 Trade payables and other liabilities) which are all categorised within level 3 and for which fair values have been usually determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on a discounted cash flow analysis, with the most significant input being the discount rate that reflects the credit risk of counterparties. Embedded derivatives that were separated from the host contract are categorized within level 2. The Bachelier model is used for the valuation of the embedded derivatives, the main parameters are the nominal amount, the floor, the length of a single floorlet, the risk free interest rate, the EURIBOR forward rates as well as the volatility of the EURIBOR forward rates. Reconciliation of Level 2 fair value measurements The total fair value gains or losses on embedded derivatives are disclosed in Note 12 Net finance costs. Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements The total fair value gains or losses on contingent considerations recognised in the statement of income are included in the table below. The fair value of contingent considerations is mainly dependent on the results of the acquired entities in a certain period after the acquisition and will be adjusted based on actuals and amended projections.

Related party disclosures According to IAS 24, related parties include those companies and persons where one person or company has the ability to control the other party or exercise significant influence over its financial and operating policies. Significant influence can be exercised in a number of ways, often through a seat on the management and/or supervisory body, but also through intra-group transactions of significant size or the exchange of management personnel. Significant influence can be established through shareholdings, bylaws or contractual agreements. In the case of share ownership, significant influence is presumed in accordance with the requirements of IAS 28 if the shareholder directly or indirectly holds 20 per cent or more of the voting rights, unless this presumption can be clearly rebutted. Significant influence is irrefutably presumed if the policy of the company can be influenced, for example, by a corresponding appointment to the supervisory bodies. Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries and between subsidiaries have been eliminated on consolidation and are not discussed in this note. With regard to SYNLAB AG and the SYNLAB Group, Cinven is able to exercise significant influence due to its shareholding (via Cinven Capital Management (V) General Partner Limited and Ephios Luxembourg S.à r.l., Luxembourg, the Company's largest shareholder). Cinven as well as other significant shareholders are therefore to be classified as a related party. In the 2021 financial year, a management service agreement existed until the IPO in April 2021, for which a total of 0.2 M€ was paid to Cinven. In addition, Cinven charged 0.2 M€ for services in connection with the IPO. In addition, a portion of the costs of the IPO were passed on to the shareholders of SYNLAB AG on a pro rata basis.

The main assumptions on which the value in use of a cash generating unit is based are the discount rate and trends in volumes, prices and direct costs (inflation) over the period. The calculation of the value in use was based on the following key assumptions: - The Group’s latest available five-year business plan shows trends in volumes, prices and direct costs based on past trends and the future market outlook which includes a specific level of uncertainties. This five-year business plan was reviewed in the current context of difficult economic environment in some European countries. - The cash flow projections for the years 2023 to 2027 also include: `o` taxes impact by applying the latest enacted rate per country; `o` working capital; and `o` capital expenditures - The terminal value is then calculated by discounting the forecast flows of the past year (2027 as the steady state of the respective CGU) using a sustainable growth rate between 1,6% and 2,0% (2021: 0.7% and 1.1%) depending |Zum 31.

This percentage is management’s best estimate of the inflationary growth effects based on the long-term inflation rates for each CGU. - The discount rate is based on the respective CGU’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC), including a leveraged beta, market risk premium, country risk premium and cost of debt. - The discount rates used are post-tax discount rates applied to post tax cash flows. Applying those rates results in a value in use materially consistent to those computed using pre-tax discount rates applied to pre-tax cash flow. (as required by IAS 36). ###### RESULT OF FULL YEAR IMPAIRMENT TESTING Based on the impairment test model calculation performed, the recoverable amount for the CGU Germany amounts to 753M€ and there was an impairment of 213M€ recognized for the CGU Germany. The impairment in Germany has been largely the consequence of the overall geopolitical situation which affected our German CGU in two (2) ways. Firstly, the rise in the yield of the 30-year German government bond increased the WACC of the CGU and secondly, the current high inflationary environment weakened our outlook for the German CGU. The financial plans are also based on assumptions about the effects of climate change and the influence of other sustainability-relevant aspects on the business development of SYNLAB. For the SYNLAB Group, climate-related risks as a result of the necessary implementation of regulatory requirements to promote a circular economy and limit climate change did not have any significant impact on the determination of the recoverable amounts of the CGUs or groups of CGUs. ###### SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS A post-tax discount rate increase of 1% point would lead to a goodwill impairment in Germany & France where it would lead to impairment of respectively 106M€ and 125M€ being recognized.

Other types of temporary differences have been grouped into single categories of other deferred tax assets and liabilities. At the end of the financial year, there were loss and interest carryforwards totaling 295.7 M€, of which interest carryforwards amounted to 119.4 M€ (2021: 507.6 M€, of which interest carryforwards amounted to 311.5 M€). The recognition of these assets, and the non-recognition of assets in respect of tax losses and interest carryforwards, is based on the estimate of the Management Board of SYNLAB on the probability of being able to use these items (prior to their expiration), including consideration of current levels of utilization, forecast operating results and the level of deferred tax liabilities recognized in the particular territory / tax grouping. Deferred Tax Assets totaling 13.1 M€ (2021: 2.4 M€) have been recognized on losses. Deferred tax assets have not been recognized in respect of losses of 132.6 M€ (2021: 186.8 M€), which are available for indefinite carry forward. These losses have arisen mainly in the UK, Spain, Germany and France. Whilst there is potential for the losses to be utilized against future taxable profits, no deferred tax asset is recognized on the basis that it is not probable that the entities will generate taxable profits in accordance with IAS 12. The Group has also previously incurred interest expense in excess of the maximum available to be offset against current profits in a number of territories. An amount of 119.4 M€ (2021: 311.5 M€) is available for indefinite carry forward depending on local regulations, primarily in Spain, and France. The decrease compared to 2021 relates to a change in our assessment on the use of interest carried forward in Germany. Deferred tax assets totaling 1.6 M€ (2021: 1.6 M€) have been recognized on excess interest amounts in companies in France which are forecasting excess interest capacity. Deferred tax assets have not been recognized in respect of excess interest amounts of 113.1 M€ (2021: 305 M€) because excess interest capacity is not currently forecasted for future periods. At 31 December 2022, the retained earnings of subsidiaries consolidated by the group include undistributed earnings that will be subject to tax if remitted to the shareholder company. Deferred tax liabilities of 0.9 M€ (2021: 4.1 M€) were recognized in 2022 for planned dividend payments by subsidiaries within the foreseeable future.

Employee benefits liabilities Most of the Group’s employees are covered by state pension and collective plans managed by third parties if required under local legislation. Those plans are defined contribution plans. In addition to these statutory pension schemes, a provision for pensions and other post-employment benefits is recorded in the IFRS consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022, 31 December 2021 based on an actuarial expert opinion for the following obligations: ###### OBLIGATIONS IN SWITZERLAND In general, employers in Switzerland must offer a pension plan to their employees in accordance with the Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors’, and Disability Pension Plans (BVG). Employees whose salary exceeds a particular threshold – which is redefined periodically – participate in the pension plan. The BVG requires a minimum plan, the ""BVG minimum"", which must be covered in any case. The Group’s pension plans in Switzerland are contribution-based plans with a guarantee of a minimum interest credit and fixed conversion rates at retirement. The pension plans also provide benefits in case of disability and death. The Group as a sponsoring employer is affiliated with various collective foundations and fulfils its legal obligation by means of a defined benefit plan. Each collective foundation is responsible for the governance of the plan and the board is composed of an equal number of representatives from the employers and employees chosen from all affiliated companies. Under the BVG, the pension plan must always be fully funded on a static basis. The Group is exposed to the risk that in the case of a funding deficit, recovery measures must be taken which encompass additional financing through employer or reduction of benefits (or both). Such a risk may occur in cases where the life expectancy of plan participants is higher than expected. Furthermore, the underlying plan assets may develop differently than expected. The Group pension obligations and ongoing service cost were calculated using the projected unit credit method, applying a discount rate of 2.3% (2021: 0.4%) and a salary increase rate of 1.9% (2021: 1.2%) p.a. Staff turnover assumptions are based on the demographic BVG 2020, (2021: BVG 2020). The individual values range from between 1.7% and 31.0%. Mortality, disability, and withdrawal probabilities were calculated in accordance with the new demographic tables BVG 2020, CMI 1.3% (2021: BVG 2020, CMI 1.3%). Long-services award commitments (“jubilee awards”) in Switzerland are based on collective or other agreements granting employees long-term claims depending on their remuneration levels and duration of service. Provisions for long-service awards were calculated applying a discount rate of 2.3% (2021: 0.4%), a salary increase rate of 1.9% (2021: 1.2%), and a staff turnover rate per BVG 2020 of between 1.7% and 31.0%. ###### OBLIGATIONS IN FRANCE In France, the Group provides retirement benefits, that are based on various collective bargaining agreements. The corresponding plans are mostly fully unfunded. The Group is exposed to the risk that the salary increase could be higher than expected. In France, the life expectancy is less important in terms of risk exposure given that the benefit is paid as a lump sum. Based on a collective agreement, a payment is granted to staff when they retire depending on their remuneration levels and duration of service. Provisions were calculated based on the following actuarial assumptions: voluntary departure, discount rate amounting to 4.0% (2021: 1.1%), inflation rate of 2.0% (2021: 2.0%), salary increase between 3.0%, holding entities only 2.0% (2021: 2.0%) p.a., age at retirement phased depending on birth date with a maximum of 65 years for employees and 67 years for executives; social charge rate 47.5% (2021: 46.5%) and low staff turnover rate. ----- SYNLAB AG ###### OBLIGATIONS IN ITALY Pursuant to statutory regulations (Trattamento di Fine Rapporto, TFR), employees are entitled to a one-time severance payment when they leave the Company. The amounts depend on the employee’s term of service and salary level. Provisions were calculated based on following actuarial assumptions: discount rate of 3.9% (2021 1.0%), inflation rate of 2.0% (2021: 1.7%) and a salary increase of 1.5% (2021: 2.0%) p.a. ###### OTHER OBLIGATIONS In certain other countries, there are legal obligations to make a one-time salary-based severance payment to a retiring employee (Austria, Ecuador) or when they leave the Company (United Arab Emirates, Mexico). The Group also assumed pension obligations from defined benefit plans for a few executive staff because of specific agreements in Ecuador, Germany and the UK. ----- SYNLAB AG",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

Share-based payment schemes SYNLAB AG has set up various long-term, share-based payment schemes for the SYNLAB Group starting in the financial year 2021. During the financial year 2022, new tranches under the existing programmes as well as a new program, the employee participation programme (EPP), were granted. The grant dates were as follows: 1. LTIP (long-term incentive plan) for the Management Board, grant date: 1 May 2022 2. LTIP for senior executives, grant date: 1 May 2022 3. Virtual LTIP for employees, grant date: 1 May 2022 4. EPP for employees, grant dates: 7 January 2022 and 7 July 2022 According to the terms and conditions of the first three programmes, share-based commitments may in general be settled in cash or in shares of SYNLAB AG (settlement option). However, the Supervisory Board and the Management Board have determined in their respective resolutions that the settlement will be made through shares in SYNLAB AG. Consequently, all three programmes are treated as equity-settled. The EPP program was defined as equity-settled in its plan documentation. Share-based commitments may be forfeited if the beneficiary's employment ends before the end of the vesting period. The share-based commitments are subject to a vesting period of two to four years and grant an entitlement to compensation which the beneficiaries will receive after the vesting period without making a payment. During the valuation of the 2022 grants for the two LTIP programmes, it was noted that the definitions of the programmes were not mathematically completely unambiguous. This was finally clarified by the Supervisory Board of SYNLAB AG and resulted in a higher number of performance share units (PSU) for the Management Board and the senior executives in connection with the 2021 grants. However, it did not change the total fair value of the programmes or the expenses recorded in the 2021 financial statements. The changes were as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2023,833

LTIP for the Management Board The awards are granted in the form of PSUs and are linked to performance criteria. For the share awards granted in the past financial year, 40% of the target amount was linked to the development of SYNLAB's share price (total shareholder return, TSR), and 60% of the target amount is linked to SYNLAB's relative share price development compared to the development of the MSCI Europe Health Care Equipment & Services sector index (TSR target). The range of target achievement of the individual performance criteria is from 0% to 300%. The vesting period is two years (2021: three years). The fair value of these entitlements was 2.05 M€ (2021: 2.05 M€) and was determined based on a Monte Carlo valuation model. The weighted average fair value of a PSU was 4.52 € (2021: 13.86 €).

The expected volatility was derived from historical volatilities. A risk-free interest rate of 0 % to 2.9 % (2021: 0.9 % to - 0.6 %) and an expected dividend yield of 2.4 % (2021: 2.0 %) were applied. Assumptions on correlations between the SYNLAB share price and the development of the MSCI Index were determined on the basis of historical price developments. LTIP for senior executives The awards for senior executives are also linked to performance criteria. Both the determination or allocation of the target amount and the determination of the fair value are identical to the LTIP for the Management Board. However, the vesting period for this plan extends over four years (2021: four years). The fair value of these entitlements was 1.4 M€ (2021: 1.2 M€). The weighted average fair value of a PSU was also 4.52 € (2021: 13.86 €). Virtual LTIP for employees In the past financial year, 313,059 virtual share awards (2021: 271,490) were granted to various employees of the SYNLAB Group. These are not linked to performance criteria but include a service criterion. The vesting period is four years (2021: four years). The fair value of these entitlements amounted to 4.1 M€ (2021: 4.5 M€) and was determined on the basis of a valuation model. The weighted average fair value of a virtual share award was 12.94 € (2021: 16.53 €). A price of 14.19 € per SYNLAB share on the grant date (2021: 17.95 €), a risk-free interest rate of 0.6 % (2021: 0.6 %) and an expected dividend yield of 2.4 % (2021: 2.0 %) were used in this model. EPP for employees In the past financial year, 10,719 free shares were granted in connection with the first tranche (T1) and 11,729 free shares were granted under the second tranche (T2) of the EPP program to employees of the SYNLAB Group. These are not linked to performance criteria but include a service criterion. Following a modification of the programme during the year, the vesting period is now two years instead of the originally planned three years. The fair value of these entitlements amounted to 0.2 M€ (T1) and 0.2 M€ (T2) respectively and was determined on the basis of a valuation model. The weighted average fair value of a virtual share award was 21 € (T1) and 16.12 € (T2). A price of 21.94 € (T1) and 16.93 € (T2) per SYNLAB share on the grant date, a risk-free interest rate of -0.5 % (T1) and 0.9 % (T2) and an expected dividend yield of 4.2 % (T1) and 6.6 % (T2) were used in this model. ----- SYNLAB AG The share awards to the Management Board, senior executives and other eligible employees developed as follows: |LTIP Management Board|2022|2021| |---|---|---| |Shares outstanding at beginning of period|147,899|-| |Granted|453,685|147,899| |Forfeited|-|-| |Shares outstanding at end of period|601,584|147,899| |LTIP senior executives|2022|2021| |---|---|---| |Shares outstanding at beginning of period|86,575|-| |Granted|313,375|86,575| |Forfeited|4,273|-| |Shares outstanding at end of period|395,677|86,575| |Virtual LTIP|2022|2021| |---|---|---| |Shares outstanding at beginning of period|271,490|-| |Granted|313,059|271,490| |Exercised|1,904|-| |Forfeited|27,476|-| |Shares outstanding at end of period|555,169|271,490| ----- SYNLAB AG **EPP** **2022** **2021** Shares outstanding at beginning of period - Granted 22,448 Exercised 445 Forfeited - Shares outstanding at end of period 22,003 The total expense for 2022, which was recorded for those four plans amounted to 3.6 M€ (2021: 1.3 M€). |EPP|2022|2021| |---|---|---| |Shares outstanding at beginning of period|-|-| |Granted|22,448|-| |Exercised|445|-| |Forfeited|-|-| |Shares outstanding at end of period|22,003|-| ----- SYNLAB AG #### 30.

The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is ----- SYNLAB AG to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. This planning considers the maturity of both its financial assets, and its projected cash flow from operations. Typically, the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period of 60 days, including the servicing of financial obligations. In addition, the Group maintains a line of credit (revolving credit facility) under which drawings could be made for financing acquisitions or for general financing purposes. Refer to Note 27 Borrowings and other financial liabilities for details on the maturities of financial indebtedness, as well as for a description of the covenants in place with the RCF agreement. Under these covenants, the Group may be unable to draw on the undrawn facility if it does not respect contractual requirements. The Group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using a systematic liquidity planning scheme. This scheme considers the maturity of its financial investments and assets, as well as the projected cash flows from operations.

The Term Loan held by SYNLAB AG (TLA) bear floating interest at 6M EURIBOR + 1.25% for a nominal amount of 735 M€. The Group does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Due to the Group’s specific interest rate risk position based currently on a floating-rate funding structure, risk management policies require the monitoring of interest rate changes. Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments From a cash perspective, all interest paid by SYNLAB on its financing debt instruments in 2022 was contractually based on a EURIBOR reference rate set at zero. The currently ongoing 6M EURIBOR increase already had an impact on the interest paid in 2022 and will increasingly impact the interest to be paid by SYNLAB in 2023. On an annual basis, a 6M EURIBOR reference at 1% or an increase by 1% would have led to an overall additional payment of 14.4 M€ on the Term Loans. If the RCF were to be drawn at its maximum amount of 485 M€, exposure to interest risk rate on financial liabilities would amount to a 4.85 M€ for an increase in the variable interest rate of 100 basis points. That exposure to interest rate risk on financial liabilities would be partly compensated for by the positive effect on financial income generated by cash equivalents, which are mostly based on variable-rate instruments. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant. At the beginning of 2022, the Group entered into an interest rate hedging contract with the aim of containing the rise in the EURIBOR base reference rate. In the event of an assumed increase of 6M EURIBOR reference of 1%, the benefit of the hedging contract would have been 4.5 M€, decreasing the calculated additional interest payment from 14,4 M€ to 9.9 M€. ###### MARKET RISK – FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Group has been exposed to limited foreign exchange risk, given that the SYNLAB Group is so far mostly present in European countries which are part of the Eurozone, except for the UK operations (which are exposed to foreign exchange risk in respect of the British pound), the Swiss operations (which are exposed to the Swiss franc), certain Northern or Eastern Europe countries, and the Rest of the World cash generating unit. Furthermore, the Group has subsidiaries in Latin America, especially in Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Mexico, and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk in respect of the Brazilian real, the Colombian peso, the Chilean peso and the Mexican peso.

Detailed quantitative information on credit risk is provided in Note 25 Trade accounts receivable. ###### TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.

To measure the expected credit losses, trade accounts receivable have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The computation of expected credit losses is performed by means of a default risk matrix, which is based on the historical default rates grouped by trade receivable class and maturity buckets. Moreover, reasonable and supportable information (if available without undue cost or effort) as at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions have been taken into account in the calculations. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument. ###### INVESTMENTS AND CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS The Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty. The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by investing mainly in liquid securities with counterparties that have a high credit rating. Management actively monitors its investments and does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.

Fair value of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis Some of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. They consist mainly of shares and other securities <20%, call options on non-controlling interests with an agreed price determination formula, and contingent consideration recorded in a business combination (as detailed in Note 32 Trade payables and other liabilities) which are all categorised within level 3 and for which fair values have been usually determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on a discounted cash flow analysis, with the most significant input being the discount rate that reflects the credit risk of counterparties. Embedded derivatives that were separated from the host contract are categorised within level 2. The Bachelier model is used for the valuation of the embedded derivatives; the main parameters are the nominal amount, the floor, the length of a single floorlet, the risk-free interest rate, the EURIBOR forward rates as well as the volatility of the EURIBOR forward rates.

The fair value of contingent consideration is mainly dependent on the results of the acquired entities in a certain period after the acquisition and will be adjusted based on actual figures and amended projections. A higher result will usually lead to higher contingent consideration, lower results will lead to lower contingent consideration. In many cases, however, a certain bandwidth of possible outcomes is defined in the contracts, which limit the movement of the contingent consideration. The total fair value gains or losses on contingent consideration recognised in the statement of income are included in the specific aggregate acquisition-related expenses detailed in Note 5.

Related party disclosures According to IAS 24, related parties include those companies and persons where one person or company has the ability to control the other party or exercise significant influence over its financial and operating policies. Significant influence can be exercised in a number of ways, often through a seat on the management and/or supervisory body, but also through intra-group transactions of significant size or the exchange of management personnel. Significant influence can be established through shareholdings, bylaws or contractual agreements. In the case of share ownership, significant influence is presumed in accordance with the requirements of IAS 28 if the shareholder directly or indirectly holds 20 % or more of the voting rights, unless this presumption can be clearly rebutted. Significant influence is irrefutably presumed if the policy of the company can be influenced, for example, by a corresponding appointment to the supervisory bodies. Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries and between subsidiaries have been eliminated on consolidation and are not discussed in this note. With regard to SYNLAB AG and the SYNLAB Group, Cinven is able to exercise significant influence due to its shareholding (via Cinven Capital Management (V) General Partner Limited and Ephios Luxembourg S.à r.l., Luxembourg, the Company's largest shareholder). Cinven and other significant shareholders are therefore to be classified as a related party. SYNLAB AG prepares the consolidated financial statements for the largest and the smallest group of companies to which the Company belongs as parent company. These consolidated financial statements are filed with the electronic Federal Gazette.

Reporting entity The consolidated financial statements were prepared by SYNLAB Aktiengesellschaft (hereinafter: “AG” and “the Company”), the ultimate parent company of the SYNLAB Group. The Group consolidated financial statements as at and for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2021 consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group” and individually as “Group entities”) and include the Group’s interest in associates. The SYNLAB Group is the largest European private supplier of medical diagnostic services, primarily involved in clinical diagnostics testing and screening services. The Group, which is based in Germany, employs approximately 30,000 people and benefits from a pan-European network across 36 countries. The Group is currently active in Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Mexico, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Panama, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, U.A.E., Ukraine and the United Kingdom. The address of SYNLAB AG is Moosacher Straße 88, 80809 Munich, Germany. During the extraordinary general meeting of SYNLAB AG on 27 April 2021, the Company’s share capital was increased by way of a non-cash capital increase. The registration of the non-cash capital increase in the Commercial Register was effective on 28 April 2021. During this transaction the shares of SYNLAB Limited, London, United Kingdom, were contributed to SYNLAB AG. SYNLAB Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act and is registered under the number 09630775 (England and Wales) and has its registered address in London, United Kingdom. With this transaction SYNLAB AG became the new ultimate parent of the SYNLAB Group. At the time of the contribution SYNLAB AG did not have any own business or operations. Additionally, the shareholders of SYNLAB AG were the same as for SYNLAB Limited before. Therefore, this transaction was a transaction under common control (IFRS 3.2(c)) and IFRS 3 Business Combinations is not applicable. This transaction is classified as a pure capital reorganisation under IFRS accounting and the predecessor approach is applied. Following this approach, the consolidated financial statements of the entity SYNLAB Limited are carried over and the 2020 consolidated financial statements of SYNLAB Limited are used as comparative financial statements for the 2021 consolidated financial statements of SYNLAB AG.. SYNLAB Limited Group financials are available at the website of UK Companies House (https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09630775/filing-history). The Company’s ultimate parent company during the majority of the year 2021 was Cinven Capital Management (V) General Partner Limited. Due to a reduction in shareholdings, Cinven Capital Management (V) General Partner Limited is no longer the ultimate parent company after November 25, 2021. ----- SYNLAB AG #### 2. Basis of preparation Due to rounding, numbers presented throughout this and other documents may not add up precisely to the totals provided and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures. ###### 2.1 Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements relate to SYNLAB AG, Munich, Germany (commercial register number HRB 246540), and its subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union (EU), and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315 e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The consolidated financial statements comply with IFRS as published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Management Board on March 15, 2022. SYNLAB prepares and publishes the consolidated financial statements in euros (€) ###### 2.2 IFRS basis adopted 2.2.1 Standards, amendments and interpretations effective or adopted in 2021 From 1 January 2021, the following new standards and amendments are effective and did not have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated Financial Statements: - Reference rate reform - phase 2 (amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16) - Amendment to the references in the standards to the financial reporting framework. - COVID-19 Related Rental Concessions after 30June 2021 (Amendment to IFRS16) 2.2.2 New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet applicable A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2021, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. - References to the Framework (Amendments to IFRS 3) with amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations - Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37) - Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards - 2018-2020 Cycle - Property, Plant and Equipment - Revenue before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16) - Insurance Contracts IFRS 17 - Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8) - Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Note 2) - Amendments to IFRS 17 - Deferred Taxes on Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12) - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1) The directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods. ###### 2.3 Basis of measurement The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following items in the statement of financial position: ----- SYNLAB AG - derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and - certain long-term financial assets are measured at fair value. ###### 2.4 Functional and presentation currency These consolidated financial statements are presented in euro, which is the Company’s functional currency. All financial information presented in euro has been rounded to the nearest thousand. ###### 2.5 Going Concern The financial statements of the Group have been prepared on a going concern basis. At 31 December 2021, the Group had net assets of 2,255.7M€ (31 December 2020: 1,203.6M€) and net current assets of 356.8 M€ (31 December 2020: 853.8 M€). The group reported an operating cash flow for the year ended 31 December of 2021 1,011.7 Mio.€ (31. December 2020: 520.4 Mio.€), cash flow from investing activities -381.0 M€ (31 December 2020 : 421.1 M€), cash flow from financing activities -1,104.1 M€ (31 December 2020 : -261.8 M€) and cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period 443.5 M€ (31 December 2020: 904.7 M€). The Directors consider the going concern basis to be appropriate following their assessment of the Group’s financial position and its ability to meet its obligations as and when they fall due. The Directors have also considered the wider operational consequences and ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic: Testing and particularly medical testing is a resilient and defensive market, which has historically had limited impact from past economic or capital market downturns. SYNLAB business assumptions about COVID-19 testing are as follows: a long-term view that an endemic virus could generate around 150 M€ of testing revenue on an annual basis and a shorter-term view that additional use cases (such as track & trace, safe at work, immunity testing, …) represent 350 M€ of additional revenue. SYNLAB can use its existing capacity -already mostly amortized- to perform the testing in relation to these revenue levels. The Group will maintain a certain COVID-19 capacity as long as medically necessary and will adjust capacity if COVID-19 volumes are durably lower. ###### 2.6 Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of the consolidated Group financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in applying the Group’s accounting policies to determine the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions to accounting estimates applied prospectively.",N/A,as_expected,2023,833
504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,2883,RESPONSIBLE GERMAN PUBLIC AUDITOR,2883.35,2.6.1 Critical accounting judgements,2883.35.1,,"In applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has applied judgement in the following areas that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements. ###### LEASES The evaluation whether or not the exercise / non-exercise of purchase or extension / termination options is “reasonably certain” may require substantial judgement. ----- SYNLAB AG The Group reassess whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option, upon the occurrence of either a significant event or a significant change in circumstances that: - is within the control of the lessee; and - affects whether the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option not previously included in its determination of the lease term, or not to exercise an option previously included in its determination of the lease term. The Group revise the lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a lease. For example, the noncancellable period of a lease will change if one of the following occurs: - the lessee exercises an option not previously included in the entity’s determination of the lease term; - the lessee does not exercise an option previously included in the entity’s determination of the lease term; - an event occurs that contractually obliges the lessee to exercise an option not previously included in the entity’s determination of the lease term; or - an event occurs that contractually prohibits the lessee from exercising an option previously included in the entity’s determination of the lease term. The lease term may also be revised following a reassessment as to whether an extension option is reasonably certain to be exercised, or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised. ###### BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Parent Company, and each of those companies over which it exercises control. Control over an entity exists when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When the Group has less than a majority of voting or similar rights in an entity, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an entity, including the contractual arrangements, and voting rights and potential voting rights. The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to the elements of control. This assessment is key in certain jurisdictions where the regulations governing the ownership and certification of laboratories require the Group to hold each clinical laboratory or a limited number of the clinical laboratories through a separate subsidiary. Certain countries also regulate the corporate form through which laboratories may be held, such as “MVZs” (Medizinisches Versorgungszentrum) in Germany and “SELs” (société d’exercice libéral) in France.

504_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,2883,RESPONSIBLE GERMAN PUBLIC AUDITOR,2883.36,2.6.2 Key sources of estimation,2883.36.1,,"Information about assumptions and estimation concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next financial year are included in the following notes. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. ###### REVENUE ESTIMATION The Group earns revenues from a wide range of analysis and diagnostic testing services, which are invoiced to a range of customers including insurance companies, hospitals, individuals, pharmacies, and National Heath organisations. The most significant areas of revenue estimation in the Group relate to: ----- SYNLAB AG a) revenue recognised based on as yet, unconfirmed public health budgets, where revenue is estimated based on historical patterns together with other publicly available information (Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Spain being the most significant segments of the business impacted); and b) accrued revenue based on complete but unbilled tests, where the calculation of the value of those tests include a level of estimation based on - pricing mechanisms as agreed during contract negotiations and used to calculate average prices; - historical experience; and - actual work performed (e.g. analyses completed). Based on historical data and experience, the measures are reliable and the economic benefits associated with the revenue recognised based on these measures are probable to flow to the entity. Please refer to Note 3 for further details. ###### GOODWILL AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL The Group determines on an annual basis whether goodwill is impaired. The determination as to whether goodwill has been impaired involves estimation of the key inputs in the impairment process including: - the forecast cash flows and management assumptions for revenue growth and EBITDA margin used in making the determinations which are based on financial budgets covering a five year period; - the key assumptions in calculating the discount rates applied to each cash generating unit or group of cash generating units (“CGUs”), in particular the risk free rate, equity risk premium, size premium and tax rates which are used in the calculation; and - the terminal growth rates applied to each of the CGUs. Please refer to Note 17 Goodwill. ###### ACQUISITIONS Acquisition accounting involves estimation in determining the fair value of the intangible assets through a purchase price allocation assumed in a business combination and the fair value of the consideration payable. The key areas of estimation include: - estimates in accounting for any unusual terms and conditions in the respective share purchase agreement (“SPA”), including contingent consideration. These amounts are contingent on the acquired business meeting agreed performance targets. At the date of the acquisition, the Group reviews the profit and cash forecasts for the acquired business and estimates the amount of contingent consideration that is likely to be due. See Note 31 Trade Payables and other Liabilities; and - the key assumptions within the fair value calculation of the intangible assets through a purchase price allocation, specifically the discount rates, revenue growth rates and future cash flow forecasts. Please refer to Note 4 Significant events and Note 18 Intangible assets. ----- SYNLAB AG ###### PENSION AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The determination of pension and other post-employment benefit obligations and expenses for defined benefit plans is dependent on a number of estimates and assumptions, including the discount rate and future mortality rate. The changes in assumptions and actuarial estimates may affect the benefit obligation, future expense and future cash flow. Refer to Notes 3 and 27. #### 3. Significant accounting policies The accounting policies adopted for the preparation of the IFRS consolidated financial statements of SYNLAB AG are described below. The accounting policies have been applied consistently by Group entities and have not changed from those applied in the 2020 consolidated financial statements of SYNLAB Limited.
