# Paternoster Holding III GmbH

_to acquire_
### Wittur International Holding GmbH €200.0 million % Senior Notes due 2023


**Guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by certain of its subsidiaries**


Paternoster Holding III GmbH, a Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung incorporated under the laws of Germany (the “Issuer”), is offering (the “Offering”)
€200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its % Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Notes”) as part of the financing for the proposed acquisition (the
“Acquisition”) of Wittur International Holding GmbH (the “Target”) by BidCo, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer.

Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually, in arrears, on each and, except for the first interest payment, which shall be payable on
October 15, 2015. The Notes mature on, 2023. Prior to, 2018, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the
Notes by paying the relevant applicable premium. Some or all of the Notes may also be redeemed at any time on or after, 2018 at the redemption
prices set forth in this offering memorandum (this “Offering Memorandum”). In addition, prior to, 2018, the Issuer may redeem at its option up to
40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this Offering
Memorandum, provided that at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued remains outstanding. Upon the occurrence of certain
events constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to repurchase all of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. In addition, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes
upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law.

Pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) will deposit the gross proceeds from the Offering into an escrow
account which will be pledged for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. The release of escrow proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions,
including the consummation of the Acquisition. The consummation of the Acquisition is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory approval. If the
Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to September 30, 2015, or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special
mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price will be a price equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, from the issue date of the Notes to the date of special mandatory redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of
Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” The escrow account will be charged on a first-ranking basis to secure the Notes.

The Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer and will rank pari passu in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s existing and future senior indebtedness and
will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The Notes and the
Guarantees (as defined herein) will be secured on the Issue Date on a first-priority basis by the Escrow Charge (as defined herein), and, on or within five business
days of the Issue Date (as defined below) on a first-priority basis by a pledge of the shares of the Issuer and a pledge of the bank accounts of the Issuer (the “Notes
**Collateral”) and on a second-priority basis by the Shared Collateral (as defined herein). The Shared Collateral will secure obligations under the Senior Facilities and**
certain hedging obligations on a first-priority basis. The Notes will be guaranteed as of the Issue Date on a senior subordinated basis by BidCo, and within 90 days of
the Completion Date on a senior subordinated basis by the other Guarantors (as defined herein). Each of the Guarantees (as defined herein) will be a senior
subordinated obligation of the applicable Guarantor, and will be subordinated to any senior indebtedness of such Guarantor, including such Guarantor’s obligations
under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations. The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests and the liability of each
Guarantor under a Guarantee will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain Limitations on the Validity and the Enforceability of the Guarantees and the
Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not
guarantee the Notes and effectively subordinated to any existing and future debt of the Issuer and its subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets which do not
secure the Notes, including the Senior Facilities, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such debt. This offering memorandum includes
information on the terms of the Notes and the Guarantees, including redemption and repurchase prices, covenants and transfer restrictions. See “Description of the
Notes.”

There is currently no market for the Notes. The Issuer will apply to have the Notes listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and to have them
admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof. There is no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange
and admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof.

**Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 26.**


**Price for the Notes:** **% plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue Date.**


We expect that the Notes will be delivered in book-entry form through Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme
(“Clearstream”) on or about, 2015 (the “Issue Date”).

**The Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities**
**Act”), or the laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States, except to qualified institutional buyers in**
**reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) and outside the United States in**
**offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act (“Regulation S”). You are hereby notified that sellers of the Notes may be**
**relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. See “Notice to Prospective Investors” and**
**“Transfer Restrictions” for additional information about eligible offerees and transfer restrictions.**

in any jurisdiction where action would be required for that purpose. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or
sold, directly or indirectly, and this Offering Memorandum may not be distributed, in any jurisdiction except in
accordance with the legal requirements applicable in such jurisdiction. You must comply with all laws that apply
to you in any place in which you buy, offer or sell any Notes or possess this Offering Memorandum. You must

The Initial Purchasers, the trustee and any other agents or persons acting with respect to the Notes make no
representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the information set out in
this Offering Memorandum and nothing contained in this Offering Memorandum is, or should be relied upon as,
a promise or representation by the Initial Purchasers, the trustee or any other agents or persons acting with
respect to the Notes as to the past or the future. The Issuer, and not the Initial Purchasers, has ultimate authority
over the information contained in this Offering Memorandum and whether and how to communicate the
information contained herein.

By receiving this Offering Memorandum, you acknowledge that you have not relied on the Initial
Purchasers or the trustee or any other agents or persons acting with respect to the Notes, or their respective
directors, affiliates, agents or advisors in connection with your investigation of the accuracy of this information
or your decision whether to invest in the Notes. By purchasing the Notes, you will be deemed to have
acknowledged that you have reviewed this Offering Memorandum and have had an opportunity to request, and
have received all additional information that you need from us. No person is authorized in connection with any
offering made by this Offering Memorandum to give any information or to make any representation not
contained in this Offering Memorandum or any pricing term sheet or supplement and, if given or made, any other
information or representation must not be relied upon as having been authorized by us or the Initial Purchasers.

The information contained in this Offering Memorandum is as of the date hereof. Neither the delivery of

information, we accept no further responsibility in respect of such information. The information set out in
relation to sections of this Offering Memorandum describing clearing and settlement arrangements, including the
section entitled “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form,” is subject to any change in or reinterpretation of the rules,

We will not, nor will any of our agents, have responsibility for the performance of the respective obligations
of Euroclear and Clearstream or their respective participants under the rules and procedures governing their

None of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), any state securities commission or any
non-U.S. securities authority has approved or disapproved of these securities or determined that this Offering
Memorandum is accurate or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense in the
United States. The Issuer has applied to have the Notes listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange (the
“ISE”) and to have them admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof, and has submitted this
Offering Memorandum to the competent authorities in connection with the listing application. Comments by the
competent authority may require significant modification or reformulation of information contained in this
Offering Memorandum or may require the inclusion of additional information. The Issuer may also be required
to update the information in this Offering Memorandum to reflect changes in our business, financial condition or
results of operations and prospects. We cannot guarantee that the application for the Notes to be listed on the
Official List of the ISE and to be admitted to trading on the the Global Exchange Market of the ISE will be
approved as of the issue date for the Notes or at any time thereafter, and the issuance of the Notes is not
conditioned on obtaining this listing.

The Issuer is offering the Notes and the Guarantors are issuing the Guarantees, in reliance on an exemption
from registration under the U.S. Securities Act for an offer and sale of securities that do not involve a public
offering. The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale, which are described under “Plan of
Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions.” By possessing this Offering Memorandum or purchasing any Note,
you will be deemed to have represented and agreed to all of the provisions contained in those sections of this
Offering Memorandum. You should be aware that you may be required to bear the financial risks of this
investment for an indefinite period of time.

We reserve the right to withdraw this Offering at any time. We are making this Offering subject to the terms
described in this Offering Memorandum. We and the Initial Purchasers may reject any offer to purchase the
Notes in whole or in part and to allot to any prospective purchaser less than the amount of the Notes sought by it.
The Initial Purchasers and certain of their respective related entities may acquire, for their own accounts, a
portion of the Notes.

**Tax Considerations**

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the consequences of
purchasing, holding and disposing of the Notes, including, without limitation, the application of U.S. federal tax
laws to their particular situations, as well as any consequences to them under the laws of any other taxing
jurisdiction, and the consequences of purchasing the Notes at a price other than the initial issue price. See

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**European Economic Area**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers of the Notes will be made
pursuant to an exemption under Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive (as defined below) as implemented in
member states of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), from the requirement to produce a prospectus for
offers of the Notes. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes
should only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for us or the Initial Purchasers to produce a
prospectus for such offer. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the
making of any offer of the Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial
Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this Offering Memorandum.

iv


-----

In relation to each member state of the EEA that has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a
“Relevant Member State”), with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is
implemented in that Relevant Member State, the offer is not being made and will not be made to the public of
any Notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated by this Offering Memorandum to the public in that
Relevant Member State, other than:

(a) to any legal entity that is a “qualified investor” as defined in the Prospectus Directive;

(b) to fewer than 100 or, if the Relevant Member State has implemented the relevant provision of the 2010
PD Amending Directive, 150, natural or legal persons (other than “qualified investors” as defined in
the Prospectus Directive), as permitted under the Prospectus Directive, subject to obtaining the prior
consent of the relevant Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers nominated by us for any such offer; or

(c) in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive; provided that no
such offer of the Notes shall require the publication by us or any Initial Purchaser of a prospectus
pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer of Notes to the public” in relation to the Notes in
any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information
on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe
the Notes, as the same may be varied in that Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the
Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State and the expression “Prospectus Directive” means
Directive 2003/71/EC (and amendments thereto, including Directive 2010/73/EU (the “2010 PD Amending
**Directive”), to the extent implemented in the Relevant Member State), and includes any relevant implementing**
measure in each Relevant Member State or a supplement to a prospectus pursuant to Article 16 of the Prospectus
Directive other than in reliance on Article 3(2)(b).

Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Notes in the offering located within a member state of the EEA will
be deemed to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is a “qualified investor” within the meaning of
Article 2(1)(e) of the Prospectus Directive. We, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates and others will rely
upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing representation, acknowledgement and agreement. Notwithstanding
the above, a person who is not a “qualified investor” and who has notified the Initial Purchasers of such fact in
writing may, with the consent of the Initial Purchasers, be permitted to subscribe for or purchase the Notes in the
Offering.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other

assumptions and that our actual results of operations, including our financial condition and liquidity and the
development of the industry in which we operate, may differ materially from (and be more negative than) those
made in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. In addition,
even if our results of operations, including our financial condition and liquidity and the development of the
industry in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering

financial condition and results of operations. New risks emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to
predict all such risks; nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any
factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any
forward-looking statements.

We urge you to read carefully the sections of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors,”
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Industry and
Market Data” and “Our Business” for a more detailed discussion of the factors that could affect our future
performance and the markets in which we operate. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the
forward-looking events described in this Offering Memorandum may not be accurate or occur at all.
Accordingly, prospective investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which
speak only as of the date on which the statements were made. In addition, from time to time we and our
representatives, acting in respect of information provided by us, have made or may make forward-looking
statements orally or in writing. These forward-looking statements may be included in, but are not limited to,

factors, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise. All subsequent

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Financial Information**

Unless otherwise indicated, the financial information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2013 and
2012 and as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 presented in this Offering
Memorandum has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by
the European Union (“IFRS”). Certain financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 and
2011 presented in this Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis of German generally accepted
accounting principles (“German GAAP”). In this Offering Memorandum, the terms “financial statements” and
“financial information” refer to the financial statements and the financial information of the Wittur Group. This
Offering Memorandum contains:

    - the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Target as of and for the
nine months ended September 30, 2014 (“Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements”),
prepared in accordance with IFRS;

    - the audited consolidated financial statements of the Target as of and for the year ended December 31,
2013 (“2013 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”), prepared in accordance with IFRS; and

    - the audited consolidated financial statements of the Target as of and for the year ended December 31,
2012 (“2012 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”), prepared on the basis of German GAAP.

The Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2013 Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements and the 2012 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements are together referred to as the
“Consolidated Financial Statements”; the 2013 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the
2012 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements are together referred to as the “Audited Consolidated
**Financial Statements.”**

The unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 included elsewhere in
this Offering Memorandum is based on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Target and is calculated by
taking the results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 (as derived from the Unaudited
Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and the Target’s accounting records) and adding them to the results of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 (as derived from the 2013 Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements and the Target’s accounting records) and subtracting the results of operations for the nine months
ended September 30, 2013 (as derived from the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and the
Target’s accounting records). This data has been prepared solely for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum,
is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting and has not been audited or reviewed.

Our income statement for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2012 included in our 2012 Audited
Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis of German GAAP, using the “nature of expense” method.
Our income statements included in our 2013 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Unaudited Interim
Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis of IFRS, using the “cost of sales” method. In
the nature of expense method, expenses are classified in the income statement according to their nature (for
example, cost of materials and personnel expenses) and not among various functions within the entity (for
example, cost of sales). As a result, income statements presented in accordance with the nature of expense
method do not show gross profit. Income statements presented in accordance with the cost of sales method,
by contrast, classify expenses according to their function as part of cost of sales, the costs of distribution or
administrative activities. Profit, however, is unaffected regardless of whether the nature of expense or cost of
sales method is chosen.

The Issuer was formed on December 19, 2014 for the purpose of facilitating the Transactions. The Issuer
does not have any business operations or material assets or liabilities other than those incurred in connection with
its incorporation and the Transactions. Consequently, limited historical financial information relating to the
Issuer is available, and no financial information with respect to the Issuer is included in this Offering
Memorandum, except for certain limited as adjusted financial data presented on a consolidated basis as adjusted
to reflect certain effects of the Transactions and the Offering. All historical financial information presented in
this Offering Memorandum is that of the Target and its subsidiaries; accordingly, all references to “we,” “us,”
“our” or the “Group” in respect of historical financial information in this Offering Memorandum are to the
Target and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

-----

In the future, we will report our financial results at the level of the Issuer, on a consolidated basis. The
Issuer will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS, which will affect
the comparability of the Issuer’s future consolidated financial statements.

The financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum are those of the Wittur Group and have not
been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the income statement, balance sheet or cash flow statement
that might occur as a result of application of purchase accounting adjustments to be applied as a result of the
Acquisition, nor have they been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the balance sheet as a result of
any limitation on our ability to use certain net operating loss carry forwards for tax purposes following the
Acquisition. We expect that the carrying value for certain deferred tax assets on our balance sheet will be
reduced upon consummation of the Acquisition as a result of these limitations. In addition, the application of
purchase accounting could result in different carrying values for existing assets and assets we may add to our
balance sheet, which may include intangible assets, such as goodwill, and different amortization and depreciation
expenses, which could be significant. Our financial statements could be materially different from the financial
statements included in this Offering Memorandum once the adjustments are made. If the Offering were registered
under the U.S. Securities Act, we would be required to present pro forma financial statements to reflect such
adjustments and the impact of the Transactions, but no pro forma financial statements are presented in this
Offering Memorandum.

The Acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Under IFRS 3 “Business
Combinations,” the cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities
incurred and the equity interests issued by the acquirer, including the fair value of any asset or liability incurred
and the equity interests issued by the acquirer, including the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a
contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at
their fair market values at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value if
the acquirer’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Since the Acquisition has not
been consummated as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have not identified the fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities to be assumed at the date of the Acquisition. In accordance with IFRS, we have up to
twelve months from the Completion Date to finalize the allocation of the purchase price.

**Differences between German GAAP, IFRS and U.S. GAAP**

There are significant differences between German GAAP and IFRS. For this reason, the 2012 Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements and the information extracted or derived therefrom are not directly
comparable to the other financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum. Our 2013 Audited
Financial Statements include a reconciliation of our financial condition and results of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2012 from German GAAP to IFRS. However, no such reconciliation is available for our
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011, which are based on German GAAP and we cannot
estimate the net effect that applying IFRS would have had on our results of operations or our financial position
for the year ended December 31, 2011. The effect of such differences might be material, and, in particular, total
shareholders’ equity (capital debit), gross profit and net income prepared on the basis of IFRS may be materially
different. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Differences between German GAAP and IFRS.”

In addition, IFRS and German GAAP differ in certain material respects from generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). As a result, the results of operations and financial
condition derived from the financial statements that are included in this Offering Memorandum may differ
substantially from the results of operations and financial condition derived from financial statements prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Issuer has not prepared a reconciliation of their financial information to
U.S. GAAP or a summary of significant accounting differences in the accounting and valuation methods of
IFRS or German GAAP and U.S. GAAP, nor has the Issuer otherwise reviewed the impact the application of
U.S. GAAP would have on its financial reporting. Accordingly, in making an investment decision, investors must
rely on their own examination of the Issuer’s financial information.

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains non-GAAP financial measures and ratios (the “non-GAAP
**measures”), including EBITDA, Historic Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FX Spot Rate Adjusted**
EBITDA, Cash Conversion, gross profit, working capital and leverage and interest coverage ratios that are not
required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles.

xv


-----

“EBITDA” is defined as the consolidated net result before transfer of profit or losses for the period adding
back interest, taxes on income, amortization and depreciation.

“Historic Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA for the period after making certain other adjustments
as described under Footnote (2) of “Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Other
Financial and Operating Data.”

“Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Historic Adjusted EBITDA excluding the estimated amount of EBITDA
for each period presented that was generated from our sales into Iran, which we are discontinuing in connection
with the Transactions.

“FX Spot Rate Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2014, after the retroactive application of certain exchange rates as of December 31, 2014 to our
results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014. The exchange rates as of December 31, 2014 used for
the purposes of this adjustment were as follows: €1.00 = RMB7.536 and €1.00 = TRY2.832, in each case not
taking into account any currency hedges.

“Cash Conversion” is defined as a quotient equal to (i) Historic Adjusted EBITDA, minus total capital
expenditures, divided by (ii) Historic Adjusted EBITDA.

“gross profit” has been calculated in accordance with IFRS and the cost of sales method.

“working capital” is defined as the sum of inventories, trade receivables and other current assets, less trade
payables and other payables and other current liabilities.

We present the non-GAAP measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used
by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and
liquidity. The non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

The non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation
or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures under IFRS as set forth in our financial
statements. Some of these limitations of non-GAAP measures are:

    - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital commitments;

    - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

    - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal
payments on our debt;

    - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

    - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated
income statement;

    - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to
be indicative of our ongoing operations;

    - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced
in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and

    - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their
usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, the non-GAAP measures should not be considered as measures of
discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be
available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our
financial statements and using these non-GAAP measures only on a supplemental basis to evaluate our
performance.

**As Adjusted Financial Information**

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain as adjusted financial information for the Issuer, which is
based on the financial information for the Wittur Group, on an as adjusted basis to reflect certain effects of the

xvi


-----

Transactions on the indebtedness, cash position and interest expense of the Issuer as of and for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2014. See “Summary—Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Other
Financial and Operating Data.” The as adjusted financial information includes the following pro forma
non-GAAP measures (the “pro forma non-GAAP measures”):

    - “Pro forma net financial debt” of the Group means the pro forma gross financial debt less pro forma
cash and cash equivalents, assuming that the Transactions had occurred on September 30, 2014; and

    - “Pro forma cash interest expense” of the Group means the interest expense on the pro forma net
financial debt for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, assuming that the Transactions had
occurred on October 1, 2013. Pro forma cash interest expense is calculated based on assumed interest
rates for the Notes.

These pro forma non-GAAP measures have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and do not
represent what our actual interest expense would have been had the Transactions occurred on October 1, 2013 or
what our actual cash position, indebtedness or secured indebtedness would have been had the Transactions
occurred on September 30, 2014, nor do they purport to project our indebtedness, cash position or interest
expense at any future date. The pro forma non-GAAP measures have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of
any changes to the income statement, balance sheet or cash flow statement that might occur as a result of
application of the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS, which will affect the comparability of the
Issuer’s future consolidated financial statements with the Wittur Group’s financial statements contained in this
Offering Memorandum. The as adjusted financial information has not been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act, other SEC requirements, IFRS, German GAAP or
other generally accepted accounting principles. Neither the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments
nor the resulting pro forma non-GAAP measures have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any
generally accepted auditing standards.

These pro forma non-GAAP measures are not measures determined based on IFRS, or any other
internationally accepted accounting principles, and you should not consider such items as an alternative to the
historical financial position or results or other indicators of our position or performance based on IFRS measures.
The pro forma non-GAAP measures, as provided for in this Offering Memorandum, may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures as presented by other companies due to differences in the way our pro forma
non-GAAP measures are calculated. Even though these types of measures are commonly used by investors, they
have important limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for
analysis of our position or results as reported under IFRS.

**Non-Financial Operating Data**

Certain key performance indicators and other non-financial operating data included in this Offering
Memorandum, including (i) number of doors sold (units), including mechanisms, (ii) number of employees
(heads), (iii) order intake and (iv) order book at the end of the period, are derived from management estimates,
are not part of our financial statements or financial accounting records, and have not been audited or otherwise
reviewed by outside auditors, consultants or experts. Our use or computation of these terms may not be
comparable to the use or computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Any or all of
these terms should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative measure of performance under IFRS.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial information presented
in millions and percentages describing market shares, have been subject to rounding and, as a result, the totals of
the data in this Offering Memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information.
Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other information set
forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are
calculated using the numerical data in each of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Target or the tabular
presentation of other information (subject to rounding) contained in this Offering Memorandum, as applicable,
and not using the numerical data in the narrative description thereof.

**SUMMARY**

_This summary highlights selected information about us and the Offering contained in this Offering_
_Memorandum. This summary is not complete and does not contain all the information you should consider before_
_investing in the Notes. The following summary should be read in conjunction with, and the following summary is_
_qualified in its entirety by, the more detailed information included in this Offering Memorandum, including the_
_Consolidated Financial Statements of the Target. You should read carefully the entire Offering Memorandum to_
_understand our business, the nature and terms of the Notes and the tax and other considerations which are_
_important to your decision to invest in the Notes, including the risks discussed under the caption “Risk Factors”_
_and “Forward-Looking Statements” and our financial statements including the notes to those financial_
_statements contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

**Overview**

We are the world’s leading independent elevator components manufacturer. The elevator components
industry is characterized by long-term growth and resilience during economic downturns due to a number of
favorable factors. Demand for elevators has grown significantly faster than GDP due to a number of favorable
global trends, such as population growth, urbanization, taller buildings, aging populations, increased wealth and
increased regulation and safety awareness. As a manufacturer of elevator components operating independently
from elevator installers, we also benefit from the trend of elevator installers increasingly seeking to outsource the
manufacture of components, which has increased the rate of growth for elevator components manufacturers
above the growth in demand for elevators. Our position as the leading independent elevator components
manufacturer has enabled us to capitalize on these growth trends, as evidenced by our strong long-term revenue
growth and EBITDA margins in excess of 10% on average since 2004.

We are a global manufacturer of elevator components with a strong footprint across multiple regions. We
divide our operations into three geographical regions which include Europe, Asia and the Rest of the World. Our
Europe region includes our operations in Africa and represents our core market, accounting for 48.6% of our
revenue in the year ended December 31, 2013, with upside potential as Southern European economies recover.
Our Asia region provides the growth engine for our business, with 37.4% of our revenue, driven by increased
urbanization and other favorable trends in China, and with the potential to grow spare parts sales in China as the
market matures. Our Rest of the World region primarily includes Eurasia, Turkey, the Middle East and Latin
America and represented 13.9% of our revenue, with the potential for significant future growth.

Our product offering features a large range of elevator components for new elevator manufacturing and
sourcing, for spare parts and for modernization and upgrades. Our components span from sophisticated
mechatronic components for elevator cabin and landing doors (including the associated opening mechanisms) to
other critical components such as gearless drives, slings, safety gears and cars. We also offer complete elevators,
which we primarily sell to independent elevator installers (“Independents”). Sales of doors and door
components accounted for 69% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2013. Doors and door
components are required at each floor of a building, so as the average height of new buildings increases, the
demand for elevator doors and door components also increases at a faster rate than demand for other components.
Doors and door components range from relatively standardized, high-volume production doors to highly
customized, special-order doors—we offer 19 models of landing doors and 15 models of elevator car doors.
Having produced approximately 1.2 million doors and door components in the year ended December 31, 2013,
we believe we are the leading elevator door and door components supplier in a highly fragmented elevator
components market.

We manufacture components for both the original equipment market and the aftermarket. We estimate that
the original equipment market makes up a larger percentage of our business in developing countries, such as
China, while the aftermarket makes up approximately 50% of our sales in a mature market such as Europe.
Aftermarket sales range from routine provision of spare parts through the lifetime of an elevator, to components
for modernization and upgrade of an elevator, to complete replacement of an elevator. In developing markets
such as China, we expect aftermarket components sales to strongly increase as the life cycle of newly-installed
elevators progresses.

Our key customers are global, multinational corporation elevator installers (“MNCs”), such as westernbased MNCs Kone, Otis, Schindler and ThyssenKrupp Elevator (“Western MNCs”) and Asian-based MNCs
Fujitec, Hitachi, Hyundai, Mitsubishi Electric and Toshiba (“Asian MNCs”), as well as Independents, which are


1


-----

typically active in a limited geographic market. In the year ended December 31, 2013, Western MNCs accounted
for approximately 68% of our revenue, Independents for approximately 32% of our revenue and Asian MNCs for
less than 1% of our revenue. We have deeply-ingrained, mutually-dependent relationships with a number of our
key customers, and benefit from multi-year, guaranteed “share-of-wallet” contracts with a number of our key
customers, allowing us to share in the growth of our customers’ business.

In the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we generated revenue of €501.4 million and Historic
Adjusted EBITDA of €72.7 million. As of September 30, 2014, we had a work force of 3,206 employees and
conducted business in more than 50 countries.

**Our Strengths**

We believe our competitive strengths include the following:

**_Leading global position_**

We are the world’s largest independent elevator component manufacturer, with unparalleled breadth and
scale across products and regions. We estimate that we generate more than two times the revenue of our next
largest competitor. We manufacture and sell a broad range of critical and technologically complex components
throughout the world. In contrast, most of our competitors are suppliers that focus on a narrow range of products
and specific regions. Our size and global footprint translate into a number of competitive advantages, including
(i) purchasing power economies of scale, (ii) the capacity to meet our customers’ volume requirements
throughout the world, (iii) the resources to manage complex global safety regulations and certification processes
and to undertake market-leading global research and development, (iv) the ability to deliver globally-consistent,
high levels of quality to our customers and (v) the ability to attract the most skilled talent in our industry.
Because of our leading position, we believe we are often MNCs’ trusted partner of choice for their most complex
projects, including high-visibility projects such as Apple store glass elevators, large hotels and marine facilities,
cruise and cargo ships and offshore oil platforms. Our long and successful track record in projects such as these
provides us with an advantage when our customers are making purchase decisions, thereby allowing us to grow
as the elevator installation industry grows, and to benefit from the same favorable trends.

**_Strong and resilient market dynamics supporting multiple levers of growth_**

The elevator and elevator components market has experienced significant growth, with growth in demand
for elevators estimated to have grown by a CAGR of 9.5% from 1996 to 2012, significantly outpacing global
GDP growth. This has been the result of a number of favorable global trends which we expect to continue,
including population growth, urbanization, taller buildings, aging populations, increased wealth and increased
regulation and safety awareness. Demand for elevator components is driven by new installations, as well as the
need for the modernization and maintenance of the installed base. New installations grow most quickly in
developing markets, such as China, while mature markets, such as those in Europe, have a greater focus on
modernization, maintenance and spare parts. As developing markets mature, we expect the aftermarket for
modernization, maintenance and spare parts in such markets to grow. We also benefit from the trend of
outsourcing, whereby elevator installers choose to outsource the manufacturing of elevator components, which
has increased in recent years, allowing elevator component manufacturers to grow more quickly than demand for
elevators. The elevator components industry lags behind the automotive industry (which itself continues to
increase the rate of outsourcing of components manufacturing) in terms of share of components outsourced, and
we expect the elevator components industry to follow the same trend. These favorable industry trends have
driven our growth.

**_Long-term growth and demonstrated resilience underpinned by a strong financial profile and stable cash_**
**_generation_**

We have achieved strong financial results over the last ten years, combined with resilience during the period
from 2009 to 2010. Our revenue has grown by a CAGR of 7% from 2004 to 2014 and, excluding 2009 to 2010,
we grew our revenues by over 10% per year on average. Our EBITDA margin has exceeded 10% on average in
each year since 2004. Even during the 2009 to 2010 economic downturn our revenues only declined by 10-15%,
and benefiting from our relatively flexible cost structure and capital expenditure profile, we maintained EBITDA


2


-----

margins in excess of 10% through strict cost management. By 2011, we were able to surpass our pre-crisis level
revenue and EBITDA. Despite weak new housing starts in China in 2014, our business in China continued to
exhibit strong growth throughout the year with a further acceleration in the fourth quarter, and healthy order book
levels for us and our key customers at the end of the year. Our growth over the last ten years has coincided with
that of our Western MNC customers, and they have also experienced margin improvement, underscoring the
overall attractiveness of the industry. We are a highly cash generative business with relatively low levels of
capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the manufacturing industry, and had Cash Conversion
of 82.7% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014. Our global production footprint provides us a natural
hedge against currency, pricing and other local risks. At the same time, we have also maintained consistent
profitability across the regions in which we operate.

**_Strong, long-standing relationships with leading MNCs_**

We are a trusted supplier to the largest international elevator companies in the world. Our largest customers
include many of the world’s most significant elevator companies, such as Kone, Schindler, Otis and
ThyssenKrupp Elevator, who together accounted for approximately 43% of total revenue in the elevator industry
in the year ended December 31, 2013. We derived approximately two-thirds of our revenue from these four
customers in the year ended December 31, 2013. We have long-standing relationships with each of these
customers, which we have maintained over the past 15 to 30 years. These long-standing relationships have
allowed us to better understand our customers’ needs and priorities, thereby enabling us to cater to our customers
from conception, design and development to manufacturing and distribution of components to offering
comprehensive after-sale services and technical support. MNCs put substantial efforts in long-term product
standardization in order to simplify and reduce complexity in the maintenance and breakdown service process. In
addition, elevator certification and safety regulations mean that changing components suppliers can add
additional compliance costs. For these reasons, elevator installers prefer to remain with selected components and
suppliers. Doing so reduces failure rates and maintenance cost, improves productivity and minimizes safety risks.
The result has been that our MNC customers engage with us to deliver on their most complex and important
projects, and rely on us as their partner of choice in a manner that would be difficult for a competitor to replicate.
Our close relationships with our key Western MNC customers are also demonstrated by our multi-year
agreements under which our largest customers have agreed to purchase a certain percentage of their requirements
for certain components from us (“share-of-wallet” agreements). We also see an opportunity to expand business
with Asian MNCs, using our close relationships with Western MNCs as a model, particularly as safety
regulations become more stringent in emerging markets to the benefit of established, high-quality component
manufacturers such as us.

**_Strong relationships with Independents_**

We also have strong, long-standing relationships with Independents, who are generally regional elevator
installers. In the year ended December 31, 2013, sales to Independents constituted approximately 32% of our
revenue. Independents accounted for approximately 39% of total revenue in the elevator industry in 2013,
typically require more individualized solutions than MNCs and outsource to a greater degree than MNCs. We
have a full-service offering for Independents that caters to their needs, including offering complete elevators and
spare parts and comprehensive support services for our components. As a result, sales to Independents typically
generate higher gross profit margins than those to MNCs.

**_Serve both the new installation market and the aftermarket_**

We sell elevator components for use in both new elevator installations and for modernizations, upgrades and
maintenance spare parts. The share of our business constituting new installations compared to modernizations,
upgrades and maintenance spare parts varies by region, depending on the age of the installed base of elevators
compared to the pace of new installation. For example, we estimate that new installations constitute
approximately 50% of our sales in mature markets such as Europe, but 90% of our sales in emerging markets,
such as China. Our ability to service both the new installation market and the aftermarket allows us to benefit
from economic growth and emerging markets, while also giving us downside protection and steady sales in
mature markets.

**_Leading research and development platform guided by deep customer and competitor insights_**
Our research and development (“R&D”) teams are supported by leading testing infrastructure, with
dedicated laboratories for doors, drives and safeties. We also systematically analyze competitor products to
improve our own products. Furthermore, existing test towers in Austria, China, Germany and Spain (currently
under construction), also give us a key advantage as an independent component manufacturer. We have seven


3


-----

R&D centers that focus on performance improvements, weight reduction, energy efficiency, reliability,
maintenance reduction, installation speed and adjustability to new industry norms. We also hold more than 300
patents.

We also cooperate with major universities, providing us access to innovative new technologies at an early
stage. In addition, we have established a close interlink between our R&D department and our product
certification team, thereby ensuring not only a short lead time for required certifications for new product
innovations, but also allowing for quick responses to new regulatory standards. Our R&D work focuses on a
“mechatronic” (the combination of mechanical and electrical engineering) design approach, which enables us to
develop intelligent components with monitoring and diagnostic capabilities, and optimizes installation time. As a
result, the individual life cycle of our components is prolonged, which further supports our customers’
profitability, and therefore their loyalty to us.

**_Experienced and diversified management team with a proven track record for value creation_**

The Wittur Group is led by chief executive officer Dr. Walter Rohregger and chief financial officer
Dr. Daniel Wiest, who are experienced managers with a track record of delivering growth at manufacturing
companies with international operations. Since joining the Wittur team in early 2012, they have developed and
implemented substantial strategic and operational improvements, including rationalization of certain of our
operations, implementation of uniform processes across functional groups, improved management practices,
relocating production to lower-cost jurisdictions and improving internal controls and have coincided with growth
in our revenues and profit margins. They lead a strong senior management team of six regional and functional
managers with a collective 39 years of experience in the industry. Following completion of the Acquisition, we
also expect to benefit from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of our future
shareholder, Bain Capital.

**Our Strategy**

Our management has formulated a comprehensive strategy covering all regions and functions that we
believe will drive growth and align the entire organization to be in a position to exploit the existing market
opportunities:

**_Benefit from group-wide continuous improvement_**

We intend to grow our business, improve our margins, and strengthen relationships with our customers by
continuously improving all aspects of our business. During the last two-and-a-half years, under the leadership of
our management team, we have begun implementing processes throughout our organization in an effort to drive
such continuous improvement. Some of the most significant operational improvements include rationalization of
certain of our operations, relocating production to lower-cost jurisdictions and improving internal controls. But
we are also taking more extensive improvements that reach deep into our organization, and cover all relevant
functions, from sales to purchasing, production, R&D and also include support functions such as finance and
human resources. Through these improvements, we have incentivized individual management to drive growth.
We believe the improvements achieved through these new processes are significant, particularly in relation to
production processes. Our production process improvements focus on improving our quality management
systems and achieving our zero accidents objective. We also are working to improve our delivery performance
and improve the quality of the suppliers from which we source materials. We intend to improve our key account
outreach and sales with Asian MNCs, and we also intend to continue to update and modernize our product range.
We are also focused on optimizing our electronic integration with our key account management teams. This
includes improving our tracking system to enable our customers to track the status of the production process.

**_Continue to grow with the industry and our MNC customers_**

We work closely with our key account MNC customers, and are in constant contact with them to increase
our business with them and benefit from upcoming outsourcing decisions. This close relationship means that as
our MNC customers grow, we plan to grow as well. In particular, we intend to grow with Kone, but also to
continue to diversify our customer base by further developing our relationships with other MNCs. For example,
we recently entered into binding, multi-year “share-of-wallet” agreements with Schindler, as well as with Kone.
We are also in active dialogue with other MNCs, including Asian MNCs, who have historically outsourced less
of their elevator components demand than Western MNCs, and intend to more substantially diversify our


4


-----

customer mix by developing relationships with other Western MNCs. Over the past twelve months, we have
received an increasing number of requests for quotes for new business from Asian MNCs, validating this
strategy. As part of our continuous improvement strategy, we have focused on optimizing our key account
management teams and strengthening our regional sales teams across all regions and have prioritized R&D to
develop our available products and retain our competitive position in the market.

**_Grow with Independents_**

Our business with Independents represents our second main source of revenue after sales to MNCs. We see
potential to grow our business with Independents, and are working to improve our sales forces’ focus on such
customers. We focus on sales of spare parts via a business-to-business platform to grow our business with
Independents. We believe that increasing regulatory requirements, particularly in developing markets, will enable
us to grow our business with Independents who typically require fully certified packages or complete elevators,
and that Independents will increasingly seek out established, high-quality component manufacturers such as
ourselves to help them meet more stringent requirements. We also believe that a focus on Independents will help
us continue our geographic expansion.

**_Further geographic expansion_**

We believe that significant opportunities for our business exist in certain developing markets where we have
not historically focused our operations. In particular, we see opportunities in Eurasia, Latin America and India
and Southeast Asia. In Eurasia, which made up approximately 5% of all new elevator installations in 2013, we
intend to grow in line with the rapidly-growing market by winning business with the MNCs and further
penetrating Independents. In Latin America, we intend to grow our business on the back of strong end market
growth and to benefit from our new plant in Brazil. In India, which made up approximately 5% of all new
elevator installations in 2013, and in Southeast Asia, we see attractive, growth driven end-markets for elevator
components, and the opportunity to sell to both MNCs and Independents operating in those markets. Our view is
that these markets are on the cusp of a strong phase of growth in demand for elevators, akin to that in China in
recent years. To exploit these opportunities, we have increased our sales forces in these regions and are working
to increase local market penetration, so we already have a strong base by which we will be able to quickly
respond to growing demand. We also intend to continue to utilize our strategy of locating our plants in low cost
countries where we benefit from labor cost efficiencies and close proximity to customers. We also are
investigating entry into the North American market. While we expect most of our growth to be organic, we may
also opportunistically undertake accretive acquisitions in the highly fragmented elevator components market.

**_Increase focus on modernization, maintenance and spare parts aftermarket_**

We see the potential for increased sales in the modernization, maintenance and spare parts aftermarket,
particularly in developing markets, such as China. At present, approximately 90% of our sales in emerging
markets are for new elevator installations. However, as the lifecycles of the elevators installed in these markets in
recent years progress over time, we expect demand for modernization, maintenance and spare parts to grow to be
similar to those in more mature markets, such as Europe, where sales of components for modernization,
maintenance and spare parts constitute approximately 50% of our sales.

**_Increase focus on new products and modernization_**

Our R&D and product development is focused on five core initiatives: (i) improving product range
completion (for example., decreasing the weight and installation time of our products); (ii) upgrading existing
best-seller-products such as our drives and slings; (iii) localization of certain products in emerging markets (for
example, introducing our existing product base and adapting it based on local requirements); (iv) improving
existing technology (such as optimizing the product range for drives and reducing their complexity); and
(v) developing new technology (for example, developing complete elevators and expanding our product range,
such as furthering new safety gears to avoid uncontrolled car movements). Our customers drive our focus and
structure the process of product development. For example, we aim to continuously modernize our products
based on customer feedback, such as minimizing energy consumption and eco-efficiency, as our customers
indicate a demand for such features.

**Our History**

We were founded in 1968 by Horst Wittur in Wiedenzhausen (Bavaria, Germany) as a manufacturer and
distributor of elevator swing doors and as a trader of elevator components focusing on the local market. Since
then, we have continuously expanded our product portfolio and production footprint, both organically and
through acquisitions (mainly by way of outsourcing transactions, such as recently taking over the Scheibbs,
Austria, facility from Kone in 2000). We have been early entrants into a number of emerging markets with local
production, such as Turkey (1993), China (1995), Argentina and Brazil (both 2000), Slovakia (2009) and India
(2010). Today, we believe we are the largest independent manufacturer of elevator components, modules and
complete elevators with an extensive global manufacturing footprint and sales network as well as a broad range
of products.

**The Transactions**

**_The Acquisition_**

On December 22, 2014, BidCo, an entity indirectly owned by Bain Capital and the direct, wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Issuer, entered into the Acquisition Agreement with TriWay HoldCo AB, Way Equity GmbH &
Co KG and Way Shareholder Loan I GmbH & Co KG to acquire all the issued and outstanding capital stock of
the Target and certain shareholder loans (the “Acquisition”). The consummation of the Acquisition is subject to
satisfaction of certain conditions, including regulatory approval in Germany, Austria, Finland, Brazil and China.
In addition, the Transaction will be subject to certain statutory conditions, such as regulatory approval in Turkey.
If regulatory approval is not obtained on or prior to, or if any injunction by a governmental authority of
competent jurisdiction that restrains or prohibits the consummation of the Acquisition is in effect as of
September 30, 2015 (or such later date as the parties to the Acquisition Agreement agree), the Acquisition
Agreement may be terminated by the Target. As part of the Acquisition, Bain Capital intends to establish a
management equity plan under which our senior management may hold ordinary shares of LuxCo. See “Certain
Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Management Equity Plan.”

The Issuer, a Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung incorporated and existing under the laws of Germany,
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HoldCo, a Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung incorporated and existing
under the laws of Germany. HoldCo, in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TopCo, a Gesellschaft mit
_beschränkter Haftung incorporated and existing under the laws of Germany. TopCo, in turn, is a wholly owned_
subsidiary of LuxCo, a Société à responsabilité limitée incorporated and existing under the laws of Luxembourg.
Each of TopCo, HoldCo, the Issuer and BidCo were acquired by Bain Capital as acquisition vehicles for the
Transactions. LuxCo was formed by Bain Capital as an acquisition vehicle for the Transactions.

**_The Financing_**

The Acquisition is expected to require €593.3 million of debt and equity financing, excluding transaction
fees and expenses, but including the repayment of the net debt of the Target and its subsidiaries. The Acquisition
will be financed in part through the issuance of the Notes in an aggregate principal amount of €200.0 million and
a drawing of the New Term Loan B Facility in an amount of €220.0 million.

As of the Completion Date, the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of €65.0 million
will also be available. Currently, it is expected that the Revolving Credit Facility will not be drawn as of the
Completion Date. See “Use of Proceeds.”

The proceeds from the financing described above will be used to:

    - fund the consideration payable for the capital stock of the Target purchased in the Acquisition;

    - repay all existing amounts outstanding under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement;

    - repay debt of certain subsidiaries of the Target; and

    - pay the fees and expenses in connection with the Acquisition and the Financing, including estimated
fees and expenses to be incurred in connection with the Offering.

Pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds from
the Offering of the Notes into the Escrow Account in the name of the Issuer. The Escrow Account will be


6


-----

controlled by, and pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of, the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes.
The release of escrow proceeds is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the consummation of
the Acquisition. If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to September 30, 2015, the Notes will be
subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price will be a price equal to
100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any,
from the Issue Date to the date of special mandatory redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of
Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

We refer to the Acquisition and the Financing collectively as the “Transactions.” See “Use of Proceeds,”
“Capitalization,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.”

**Recent Developments**

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have completed trading for the year ended December 31,
2014. Our estimated EBITDA and revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014, increased compared to our
EBITDA and revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of strong sales performance,
particularly MNC sales from our businesses in China and Austria. Our estimated revenues for the two months
ended November 30, 2014 were between approximately €93 and €103 million, which constituted an increase of
15% to 20% compared to the revenues for the two months ended November 30, 2013. These increases were also
primarily due to strong sales performance, particularly MNC sales in China and Austria. Despite weak new
housing starts in China in 2014, our business in China continued to exhibit strong growth throughout the year
with a further acceleration in the fourth quarter, and healthy order book levels for us and our key customers at the
end of the year.

The preliminary financial results presented above are derived from our accounting records and internal
management accounts. This information has not been audited, reviewed or compiled, nor have any procedures
been performed by our independent auditors with respect thereto. Accordingly, no opinion or any other form of
assurance is provided with respect thereto. We have not yet prepared consolidated financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2014 nor have we completed our year-end accounting close processes. Accordingly,
the preliminary financial results presented above are subject to the completion of our results for the year ended
December 31, 2014, may change and those changes may be material.

Guarantors (excluding BidCo) accounted for 64% of our
consolidated gross assets (excluding goodwill and certain other
intangible assets resulting from the purchase price allocation of
our acquisition by Triton in 2010 which cannot be allocated to
individual subsidiaries), 50% of our consolidated net sales and
60% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Group (in each case,
excluding BidCo).

The Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing
Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” The Guarantees will be
subject to release under certain circumstances. See “Description of
the Notes—The Notes Guarantees—Notes Guarantees Release.”

**Security . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Subject to certain agreed security principles and certain perfection
requirements, on the Issue Date or within five business days thereof,
the Notes and the Guarantees (upon the granting thereof by the
respective Guarantors) will be secured:

(i) on a first-priority basis, by the Notes Collateral consisting of:

                            - the Escrow Charge (which will be in place on the Issue Date);

                            - a pledge of the shares of the Issuer; and

                            - a pledge of the bank accounts of the Issuer; and


11


-----

(ii) on a second-priority basis pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement to obligations under the Senior Facilities, by the
Shared Collateral; consisting of:

                            - a pledge of the shares of BidCo;

                            - a security interest in respect of the Proceeds Loan;

                            - a pledge of the bank accounts of BidCo; and

                            - an assignment of BidCo’s claims under the Acquisition
Agreement.

The Shared Collateral will secure obligations under the Senior
Facilities and certain hedging obligations on a first-priority basis.

Lenders under the Senior Facilities will receive priority to the
proceeds from the Collateral in the event of any enforcement. See
“Description of the Notes—Security.”

The Collateral will be subject to contractual and legal limitations and
may be released under certain circumstances. See “Certain
Limitations on the Validity and the Enforceability of the Guarantees
and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law
Considerations” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release
of Liens.” No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in
connection with this Offering. By its nature, some of or all the
Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable
market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold
in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related
to the Notes and Our Structure.

**Intercreditor Agreement . . . . . . . . . . . .** The indebtedness and obligations under the Notes and the Senior
Facilities and certain other existing and future indebtedness and
obligations permitted under the Indenture governing the Notes will be
secured by liens on the Collateral. Under the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, however, in the event of enforcement of the Shared
Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the
Shared Collateral only after the lenders under the Senior Facilities
have been repaid in full.

Moreover, the holders of the Notes will be subject to certain
limitations on their ability to take certain actions in respect of the
security interests in the Collateral, including certain standstill periods
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
Agreement.”

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special**
**Mandatory Redemption: . . . . . . . . .** Pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers
will deposit the gross proceeds from the Offering of the Notes into the
Escrow Account. The Escrow Account will be controlled by the
Escrow Agent, and pledged on a first-priority basis in favor of, the
Trustee in its capacity on behalf of the holders of the Notes. Upon
delivery to the Trustee in its relevant capacity and the Escrow Agent
of an officer’s certificate stating that the conditions to the release of
the proceeds from escrow are satisfied, the escrow proceeds will be
released to the Issuer and utilized as described in “The Transactions,”
“Use of Proceeds,” and “Description of the Notes—Escrow of
Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” The release of escrow
proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions,
including the consummation of the Acquisition. The consummation of
the Acquisition pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement is subject to
the satisfaction of certain conditions, including regulatory approval.


12


-----

In the event that (a) the Completion Date and the release of escrow
proceeds does not take place on or prior to September 30, 2015, (b) in
the reasonable judgment of the Issuer, the Acquisition will not be
consummated by September 30, 2015, (c) the Acquisition Agreement
terminates at any time prior to September 30, 2015, (d) Bain Capital
cease to beneficially own and control a majority of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Issuer or (e) certain insolvency events
of default occur on or prior to September 30, 2015, the Notes will be
subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory
redemption price will, in each case, be a price equal to 100% of the
aggregate issue price of the relevant Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the date
of the special mandatory redemption. The relevant escrow proceeds
would be applied to pay for any such special mandatory redemption.
In the event that the funds on deposit in the Escrow Account are
insufficient to pay the special mandatory redemption price, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, Bain
Capital will be required to make an equity contribution to the Issuer
in an amount required to enable the Issuer to pay such accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, owing to the holders of
the Notes, pursuant to an agreement between Bain Capital and the
Trustee. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption,” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
Transactions—If the conditions to the escrow are not satisfied, the
Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes, which means that you
may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes.”

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer intends to use the gross proceeds from the Offering,
together with the New Term Loan B Facility and the Equity
Contribution, to (i) fund the consideration payable for the capital
stock of the Target purchased in the Acquisition; (ii) repay all existing
net debt outstanding under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement
and the net debt of certain subsidiaries of the Target; and (iv) pay the
fees and expenses in connection with the Transactions, including
estimated fees and expenses to be incurred in connection with the
Offering. See “The Transactions—The Financing” and “Use of
Proceeds.”

**Additional Amounts; Tax**
**Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** All payments made with respect to the Notes will be made without
withholding or deduction for taxes in any Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Withholding
Taxes”), except to the extent required by law. If withholding or
deduction is required by law, the Issuer will pay additional amounts
so that the net amount you receive is no less than that which you
would have received in the absence of such withholding or deduction,
subject to certain exceptions. See “Description of the
Notes—Withholding Taxes.”

If certain changes in the law of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
become effective that would impose withholding taxes or other
deductions on the payments on the Notes, the Issuer may redeem the
Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of
100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. See
“Description of the Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”

**Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Prior to, 2018, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the
Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes
redeemed plus the applicable “make whole” premium set forth under


13


-----

the caption “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption,” plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any (subject to the rights of holders of
the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due
on the relevant interest payment date). See “Description of the
Notes—Optional Redemption.”

Prior to, 2018, the Issuer may, on one or more occasions,
redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
issued under the Indenture with the proceeds from specified equity
offerings at a redemption price equal to % of the aggregate principal
amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the date of redemption, provided that at least 60%
of the original principal amount of the Notes issued under the
Indenture remains outstanding. See “Description of the Notes—
Optional Redemption.”

On or after, 2018, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the
Notes at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum
under the caption “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, the Issuer
will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a
purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the purchase (subject to the
right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date). See “Description
of the Notes—Change of Control.”

**Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The indenture governing the Notes (the “Indenture”) will contain
certain covenants that restrict, among other things, our ability to:

                         - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain
preferred stock;

                         - pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock;

                         - make certain restricted payments;

                         - make certain investments;

                         - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                         - impose restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay
dividends or make other payments to us;

                         - merge or consolidate with other entities, or make certain asset
sales;

                         - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

                         - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes.

                         - guarantee certain indebtedness; and

                         - layer certain indebtedness.

Each of the covenants is subject to a number of important exceptions
and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain
Covenants.”

**Transfer Restrictions . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered under the U.S.
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and will
not be so registered. The Notes are subject to restrictions on
transferability and resale. See “Transfer Restrictions.” Holders of the
Notes will not have the benefit of any exchange or registration rights.

**No Prior Market . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Although application will be made to have the Notes listed on the
Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and for trading on the
Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange in accordance
with its rules, no assurances can be given that the Notes will become,
or remain, listed on the Irish Stock Exchange. The Notes will be new
securities for which there is no market. Although the
Initial Purchasers have informed us that they intend to make a market
in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and they may discontinue
market making at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot
assure you that an active trading market for the Notes will develop or
be maintained.

**Original Issue Discount . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. If the stated principal amount of the Notes
exceeds their issue price by more than a statutorily defined de minimis
amount, the Notes will be treated as issued with original issue
discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, U.S.
holders (as defined in “Taxation—Certain United States Federal
Income Tax Considerations”), whether on the cash or accrual method
of tax accounting, would be required to include amounts representing
original issue discount in gross income (as ordinary income) on a
constant yield to maturity basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes
in advance of the receipt of cash payments to which such income is
attributable. For further discussion, see “Taxation—Certain United
States Federal Income Tax Considerations.”

(*) The financial information as of and for the year ended December 2011 and 2012 has been derived from the 2012 Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements which were prepared on the basis of German GAAP. Please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Differences between German GAAP and IFRS.”
(**) The difference of €10.1 million in sales under German GAAP and revenue under IFRS for the year ended December 31, 2012, reflects
the sale of the operations of Wittur Hydraulic Drives s.r.l., Bagnatica, Italy, in 2013, which was classified as discontinued operations for
purposes of the 2013 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and therefore was excluded from the presentation of revenues under
IFRS, but not from the presentation of sales under German GAAP. For additional details, please see note 5.9 to the 2013 Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

(*) The financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011 presented above has been derived from the 2012 Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements, which were prepared on the basis of German GAAP. Please see “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Differences between German GAAP and IFRS.” As used for the period
ended December 31, 2011, the term revenues refer to sales, the term total capital expenditure refers to payments made for investments in
tangible assets and intangible assets and the term change in working capital refers to the decrease in inventories, trade receivables and
other assets that are not allocable to investing or financing activities less the increase in trade payables and other liabilities that are not
allocable to investing or financing activities, in each case as defined under German GAAP. Amounts presented under the column for the
year ended December 31, 2011 have not been prepared on a comparable basis to the other amounts presented.
(**) Audited financial information. Revenues by region for the year ended December 31, 2011 have been regrouped to match our present
revenue split and include sales deductions. Therefore, the revenues by region for the year ended December 31, 2011, deviate from our
2012 Audited Financial Statements in which revenues by region had been grouped differently and did not include sales deductions.
Revenues by region for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 include sales deductions and thus deviate from our 2013 Audited
Financial Statements in which revenues by region for these years do not include sales deductions.
(1) Revenues (excl. Iran) represents, for any period, consolidated net revenues of the group, excluding sales into Iran, which we are
discontinuing in connection with the Transactions
(2) We define EBITDA as the consolidated net result for the period adding back finance expense, finance income, income taxes and
depreciation and amortization. We define Historic Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA as adjusted to reflect the extraordinary income and

expenses described below. We define Adjusted EBITDA as Historic Adjusted EBITDA excluding the estimated EBITDA generated
from sales to Iran in such period. We define FX Spot Rate Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA after giving effect to the pro forma
application of the exchange rates as of December 31, 2014 to the twelve month period ended September 30, 2014. We believe that these
EBITDA-based measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance and our ability to incur and service our
indebtedness. These EBITDA-based measures are not indicators of performance recognized under IFRS or German GAAP. These
EBITDA-based measures are not necessarily comparable to the performance figures published by other companies. You should exercise
caution in comparing these EBITDA-based measures as reported by us to EBITDA-based measures of other companies. For more

(A) For the year ended December 31, 2011, net result for the period for continuing operations refers to consolidated net loss for the year,
finance expense refers to interest and similar expenses, finance income refers other interest and similar income and income taxes
refers to the sum of taxes on income and other taxes, in each case as defined under German GAAP. Amounts presented under the
column for the year ended December 31, 2011 have not been prepared on a comparable basis to the other amounts presented. For all
periods presented, except for the year ended December 31, 2011 and the nine months ended December 31, 2014, depreciation and
amortization as presented in this table excludes discontinued operations, and therefore is not identical to depreciation and
amortization as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(B) Reorganization costs relate to expenses incurred to reorganize certain aspects of our operations. These reorganization costs were
incurred in connection with new initiatives put in place by our new group management in 2012, including:

       - in the year ended December 31, 2012: the closing of our plant in Madrid, Spain, and relocation of certain of its former
operations and employees to Zaragoza, Spain; as well as related severance expenses; start-up costs related to our plant opening
in India; and professional fees and one-off taxes related to the foregoing;

       - in the year ended December 31, 2013: severance and redundancy costs and consultancy fees related to the transfer of certain
operations from Italy and Spain to Slovakia; consultancy and legal fees related to the merger of certain subsidiaries in Germany
and the demerger of certain subsidiaries in Austria for tax optimization purposes; the release of a provision for severance and
redundancy costs which resulted from certain employees who agreed to relocate from our closed Madrid plant; and

       - in the nine months ended September 30, 2014: interim management and recruitment costs related to the restructuring of our
operations at our facility in Dresden, Germany.

(C) Severance and recruitment costs relate to the hiring of our new group management in 2012 and initiatives put in place by our new
group management, including:

       - in the year ended December 31, 2012: severance payments, transaction expenses and legal fees paid in connection with the
replacement of the former group chief executive officer and chief financial officer;

       - in the year ended December 31, 2013: severance payments, transaction expenses and legal fees paid in connection with the
replacement of certain other of our senior managers; severance and redundancy costs in connection with headcount
rationalization in our Argentina office in 2013; and severance and redundancy costs paid in connection with headcount
rationalization in our norms and patent department; and

       - in the nine months ended September 30, 2014: the transfer of certain of our operations in Rome, Italy, as well as related
severance expenses.

-----

(D) Project costs and consultancy fees relate to costs and fees incurred in connection with one-off projects, including:

       - in the year ended December 31, 2012: consultancy fees paid to consultants who advised us on our transition from German
GAAP to IFRS and for the implementation of new consolidation software and new consolidation processes; recruiting costs for
the search and selection of a new senior management team, for which we reimbursed our shareholders; and incremental
expenses attributable to the larger-than-normal supervisory board that our existing shareholders maintained;

       - in the year ended December 31, 2013: consultancy fees paid to consultants who advised us on our transition from German
GAAP to IFRS and for the implementation of new consolidation software and new consolidation processes; consultancy fees
related to one-off tax optimization projects, in particular optimization of tax treatment in China; consulting fees related to our
now-abandoned plans to sell our facility in Dresden, Germany; consultancy fees paid to an affiliate of one of our existing
shareholders for purposes of such shareholder implementing purchasing savings and strategies across its portfolio; and
incremental expenses attributable to the larger-than-normal supervisory board that our existing shareholders maintained; and

       - in the nine months ended September 30, 2014: fees and expenses paid in connection with our sale process.

(E) Shareholder loan refinancing costs relate to stamp taxes and consulting, legal and other uncapitalized expenses incurred in relation
to the refinancing of a shareholder loan in 2013.
(F) Exclusion of EBITDA generated by business with Iran excludes from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA our estimated EBITDA
for each period presented that were generated from our sales into Iran, which we are discontinuing in connection with the
Transactions. We calculated the EBITDA generated by business with Iran by multiplying net sales into Iran by the EBITDA margin
of our Turkish subsidiary (from which our sales to Iran have been made), before applying management and sales costs applicable to
the Group on a consolidated basis. The EBITDA margin of our Turkish subsidiary is higher than that of the Wittur Group as a
whole.
(G) Represents the effect on Adjusted EBITDA of a pro forma application of certain exchange rates as of December 31, 2014, to the
twelve months ended September 30, 2014. The pro forma increase results from the euro’s depreciation against the Chinese renminbi
and the Turkish lira in 2014. We did not make pro forma adjustments for other exchange rates. The exchange rates as of
December 31, 2014, used for the purposes of this adjustment were as follows: €1.00 = RMB7.536 and €1.00 = TRY2.832, not
taking into account any currency hedges. The average exchange rates for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 were
€1.00 = RMB8.341 and €1.00 = TRY2.890. As of January 29, 2015, the exchange rates were as follows: €1.00 = RMB7.0619 and
€1.00 = TRY2.7290. Application of the exchange rates described above is not indicative of any past or future performance. Foreign
exchange rates are volatile, and our currency of account, the euro, is subject to increases and decreases in value against other
currencies, including the Chinese renminbi and the Turkish lira. The depreciation of the euro against these currencies may not
continue in the future, or may reverse, with the relative value of the euro increasing in the future. Such an appreciation of the euro
against these currencies in the future would reduce, eliminate or even reverse the effect described above, which could have a
negative impact on our results of operations, and such negative impact could be significant. In addition, our results of operations for
any particular period will be affected by currency exchange rates over the entire period and not on any particular date, as well as for
other exchange rate movements.

(3) Adjusted EBITDA margin represents, in any period, Adjusted EBITDA for such period, divided by revenues (excl. Iran) for such period.
(4) Gross profit margin represents a quotient equal to (i) revenues for such period, minus costs of goods sold for such period, divided by
(ii) revenues for such period.
(5) For the year ended December 31, 2011, total capital expenditures represents payments made for investments in tangible assets and
intangible assets. For any other period presented, total capital expenditures represents the sum of purchase of property, plant &
equipment and purchase of intangible assets for such period.
(6) Represents change in working capital as presented in the cash flow statement included in the financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2013 and in the interim financial statements for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014. See “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Working Capital.”
(7) For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash conversion represents a quotient equal to (i) EBITDA, minus payments made for
investments in tangible assets and intangible assets, divided by (ii) EBITDA. For any other period presented, cash conversion represents
a quotient equal to (i) Historic Adjusted EBITDA, minus total capital expenditures, divided by (ii) Historic Adjusted EBITDA.
(8) _Pro forma net senior financial debt represents the pro forma gross financial debt of the Group that is senior indebtedness (including_
structurally senior indebtedness of subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, minus pro forma cash and cash equivalents, after giving effect to
the Transactions as if they had occurred on September 30, 2014.
(9) _Pro forma net financial debt represents the pro forma gross financial debt of the Group, minus pro forma cash and cash equivalents, after_
giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on September 30, 2014.
(10) Pro forma cash interest expense represents the estimated interest expense of the Group on a pro forma basis for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2014, after giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on October 1, 2013.

(1) Employee figures are headcount figures (including temporary workers in 2011 and 2012). Employee figures are based on the annual
average for 2011, but on the number at period-end for all other periods presented.
(2) We count order intake upon execution of a definitive contract and one of (i) receipt of the agreed down-payment or (ii) confirmation of
committed financing; Order intake represents a gross number, which includes certain changes of existing orders that are counted as a new
order (with the original order being deemed cancelled, but not netted off against the gross number of order intakes).
(3) Order book at the end of the period represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before we and the
customer are required to perform. Order book does not include prospective orders where customer-controlled contingencies remain, such
as customers receiving approval from their board of directors or shareholders and the completion of financing arrangements. All such
contingencies must be satisfied or must have expired prior to recording an order in the backlog, even if satisfying such conditions is
highly certain. However, orders may still be cancelled and any replacement orders are not required to have the same value.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information contained in_
_this Offering Memorandum, you should carefully consider the following risk factors before purchasing the Notes._
_The risks and uncertainties we describe below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of_
_which we are not aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also adversely affect our business,_
_financial condition and results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and_
_Guarantees. If any of the possible events described below were to occur, our business, financial condition and_
_results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If that happens, the trading prices of the Notes_
_could decline, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on the Notes when due and you could lose all or_
_part of your investment._

_This_ _Offering_ _Memorandum_ _also_ _contains_ _“forward-looking”_ _statements_ _that_ _involve_ _risks_ _and_
_uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking_
_statements as a result of various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering_
_Memorandum. Please see “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**Risks Related to the Industry in which We Operate**

**_Our industry exhibits correlation to new construction in the commercial and residential real estate markets._**

The level of demand for our products depends upon the level of demand for new elevators installations, and,
to a lesser extent, for modernization and maintenance of spare parts in the elevator aftermarket. Demand for new
installations is correlated to new construction in the commercial and residential real estate markets. Therefore,
our income and results of operations have been influenced, and will continue to be influenced, by the general
state and the performance of the commercial and residential real estate markets. The commercial and residential
real estate construction markets are volatile, and are affected by a variety of factors, such as economic
development, urbanization, demographic growth, mobility, wealth and income levels, consumer confidence,
home equity values, home equity loan withdrawals, consumer spending habits, reasonably attainable consumer
financing and interest rates.

For example, during the recent global financial crisis, the number of new builds in the commercial and
residential real estate markets declined sharply. As a result, the demand for elevator components decreased, and
our income and results of operations were negatively impacted. If a similar event were to occur again, including
any prolonged or significant downturn in the Chinese residential housing and construction market, we would
expect our results of operations to be adversely affected.

Any downturn in the commercial and residential real estate markets could cause demand for new elevators
to decline, which in turn could cause demand for the elevator components we manufacture that are used in new
elevator installations to decline. Any deterioration in the commercial or real estate markets could therefore have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our
obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We are dependent on a small number of significant customers._**

We derive a significant amount of our revenues each year from a small number of large MNCs, particularly
in Asia. In the nine months ended September 30, 2014, our four largest customers (Kone, Otis, Schindler and
ThyssenKrupp Elevator) accounted for approximately two-thirds of our revenue, and 92.7% of our revenue in
Asia. Our business and results of operations are largely dependent on the success of our significant customers.
The loss of any large customer, a decline in the volume of sales to these customers or the deterioration of their
financial condition could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
We could also be adversely affected if a serious accident occurs due to an elevator installed by one of our
primary MNC customers, as such an accident could adversely affect such MNC’s brand, reputation and sales for
an extended period of time. MNCs typically do not rely on a single supplier in their outsourcing strategy but are
increasingly migrating towards double- or triple-outsourcing strategies pursuant to which they retain two or three
suppliers. Such outsourcing can be beneficial to MNCs for several reasons, including to manage the risk of
product recall when there is a potential quality issue with any outsourced product. As a result, we may lose some,
or all, of the sales volume to one or more of our MNC customers to another of their key suppliers. As MNCs
continue to outsource an increasingly greater share of their components, our dependence on these customers may
also increase.

26


-----

We do not have binding framework agreements with all of our significant customers, but instead operate on
an order-by-order basis with some of them, which means that such customers do not have any contractual
obligation to continue to do business with us.

For those customers with whom we do have binding framework agreements, the term of such agreements is
typically approximately three years, with renewal periods thereafter. We may not successfully be able to renew
such agreements, including our “share-of-wallet” agreements with our largest customers on a timely basis, on
terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, our existing agreements include change of control clauses which
entitle our business partners to termination upon the completion of the Acquisition. See “—Risks Related to The
Transactions—The Acquisition will entitle our customers and certain other business partners of the Wittur Group
to terminate their agreements as a result of change of control provisions.” Failure to renew or extend our sales
agreements with our key customers for any reason could have a negative impact on our revenues and business
prospects, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of
operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We are exposed to substantial risks associated with macroeconomic conditions, including the performance of_**
**_the global economy and the Eurozone debt crisis._**

The markets in which we operate are materially influenced by general economic conditions and
macroeconomic cycles and volatility. The levels of economic activity vary widely in the different regions and
countries where we operate and, in some of these regions and countries, typically display cyclical changes and
fluctuations at intervals shorter than a year. A downturn in economic activity, either globally or in the markets in
which we operate, could lead, among other effects, to a reduced demand for our products and services, increasing
price pressure or increasing the inability of our customers to make payments. For example, during the economic
downturn of 2009-2010, our revenues declined by 10-15%. We are most exposed to downturns in Europe (where
we generated 46% of our revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014) and Asia (where we
generated 40% of our revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014). Because approximately
two-thirds of our customers are MNCs, whose business largely fluctuates with the global economic cycles, we
are exposed to a decrease in demand resulting from any potential economic downturns.

In particular, should the political tensions between Russia and Ukraine continue or should a conflict
between the two nations ensue, the strength of the global economy could deteriorate. In mid-December 2014, the
Russian central bank significantly increased its base interest rate in light of the weakening of the Russian ruble.
This could lead to worsening credit conditions in Russia combined with low growth, which in turn could affect
the political and economic condition in both Europe and Asia, as well as impacting our Rest of the World
operations, more than 70% of which are in Eurasia (including Russia).

Should ongoing political tensions between countries, movements and armed groups in the Middle East
continue or should a broader conflict between nations ensue, the strength of the global economy could also
deteriorate, harming our business.

Concerns about the levels of sovereign debt of several countries of the Eurozone, including Cyprus, Greece,
Italy, Ireland, Spain and Portugal, together with the risk of contagion to other, more stable, countries, particularly
France and Germany, has raised uncertainties regarding the stability and overall standing of the European
Monetary Union. Concerns that the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis could worsen may lead to the reintroduction
of national currencies in one or more Eurozone countries or, in particularly dire circumstances, the abandonment
of the euro. The departure or risk of departure from the euro by one or more Eurozone countries or the
abandonment of the Euro as a currency could have major negative effects on both existing contractual relations
and the fulfillment of obligations by us and/or our customers. It could also spur a global or European economic
downturn, which would negatively impact our business.

Any material future deterioration in economic conditions for the aforementioned or other reasons could
materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations, which could in turn have a
negative impact on our revenues, profitability and business prospects, which in turn could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations
under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We are exposed to the risk of underutilization or lack of capacity due to the cyclicality of our industry._**

Since our business is characterized by high fixed costs associated with our production plants, we risk
underutilization of our facilities or having insufficient capacity to meet customer demand if the markets in which

27


-----

we are active either decline or grow faster than we have anticipated. An underutilization of our facilities could
result in idle capacity costs, write-offs of inventories and losses on products due to falling average sale prices,
with falling production volumes causing declines in revenue and earnings. On the other hand, lack of capacity
would limit our ability to exploit opportunities for new business, and may hamper relationships with our
customers if we are unable to meet their purchasing requirements.

Sales to our customers are to a certain extent cyclical and depend, among other things, on general economic
conditions as well as on construction trends, which can be affected by a number of factors, including
unemployment rates, energy costs, interest rate levels, inflation, globalization, demographic changes, demand for
green and sustainable construction, the increasing importance of technology in construction and growing demand
from emerging economies such as Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Northern Africa, Russia and Turkey.
Given the variety of such economic parameters influencing the global demand for elevator components, the
market volume of elevator component production has historically been, and will continue to be, characterized by
a degree of fluctuation, making it difficult for us to accurately predict demand levels for our products aimed at
the elevator components sector.

The risks related to the nature of the industry in which we operate could have a negative impact on our
revenues and business prospects, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_The outsourcing trend in our industry may not continue, and may even reverse._**

The outsourcing of the production of elevator components by global MNCs and Independents to suppliers is
an ongoing trend which has driven demand for elevator parts. A number of factors drive outsourcing by elevator
producers, including (i) the ability of the elevator producer to focus on core activities, such as the elevator
installation and maintenance business without having to attend to potential production issues; (ii) increased
flexibility of the elevator producer in terms of production capacity and locations as well as increased speed of
penetration of new markets; (iii) the ability to free up cash by avoiding capital expenditures for new production
facilities; (iv) lack of economies of scale and in-house production capacities of a large number of elevator
producers; and (v) the ability of MNCs to access innovation capabilities and best-in-class processes through
outsourcing. We estimate that as of December 31, 2014, approximately 55% of the total components market for
doors and drives was outsourced to suppliers, as opposed to 45% produced in-house by MNCs. Our business has
historically benefited from the outsourcing trend in our industry. However, this trend may not continue, and may
even reverse. If our customers decide to reduce the number or volumes of products they outsource to us, this
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to
fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We face competitive pressures from the potential expansion of our local competitors into the global market._**

Because a key part of our success in relation to our competitors is our ability to leverage our leading global
position, this advantage may be eroded if our smaller competitors expand their businesses into other regions in
which we operate. We also face growing competition in our areas of strategic expansion. For example, our
Chinese competitors, including leading local elevator components players, have been expanding, or are expected
to expand, their operations in the Chinese market. Such local companies could also expand their operations
outside of China. A number of our local competitors may merge or form strategic alliances with, or acquire, other
competitors in both their home regions and elsewhere. Our inability to compete effectively in a more competitive
environment marked by an increase in global players could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the
Guarantees.

**_We face risks in the regions in which we operate, including in emerging markets._**

We operate globally, and a substantial portion of our business relates to emerging markets. The proportion
of our business that relates to emerging markets may increase in the future as we further expand into emerging
markets such as China. Due to the international scope of our business operations, we face risks with respect to
possible geopolitical, economic and social instability, terrorist attacks, natural disasters and epidemics, as well as
exposure to adverse government action and to changes in a specific country’s or region’s laws, regulatory
requirements and policies affecting trade and investment. These factors could, in addition to directly affecting us,
have an adverse effect on the general level of economic activity, which could also indirectly lead to reduced sales

28


-----

opportunities for us and adversely affect our growth prospects. Moreover, certain countries or regions in which
we operated in the past and may continue to operate, such as China, India, Argentina, Russia, Turkey, Northern
Africa and Brazil, have different business practices and in some cases considerably lower levels of economic,
political, and legal stability compared to Western Europe.

Emerging markets are, to varying degrees, influenced by political, economic and market conditions in more
industrialized countries, particularly the United States and the Eurozone. In particular, changes in the U.S. and
European central bank policy and resulting currency devaluations may lead to significant economic volatility in
emerging markets.

Our presence and growth plans in China expose us to significant risks linked to the Chinese economy. In
2012, China’s economic growth decelerated to its slowest pace since the global financial crisis. China was
significantly impacted by the contraction in the Eurozone economy, which, until 2012, when the United States
surpassed the Eurozone, had been China’s biggest export partner. The Chinese government focuses heavily on
investment to stimulate growth in the Chinese economy. However, it is unclear whether such actions to stimulate
growth will be coupled with increasingly strict regulation. A significant factor impacting economic growth in
China has been the Chinese residential housing market, with demand for housing driving a boom in construction
and related raw materials. However, in the second half of 2014, housing prices in China declined compared to
2013, sparking concern that China may suffer a residential real estate crisis similar to that suffered in the United
States in 2008-2009. While the near-term future of the Chinese housing and construction markets cannot be
predicted, any significant slowdown in new construction in China could impact our business in China and
adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the
Notes and the Guarantees. See also “—Our industry exhibits correlation to new construction in the commercial
and residential real estate markets.”

The Chinese “shadow banking” sector has grown rapidly in recent years, and a significant amount of credit
and liquidity is provided by Chinese institutions outside the scope of financial regulation. Due to the lack of
supervision, the complexity of shadow banking activities and the close connection between the shadow banking
sector and the regulated financial sector, any significant liquidity shortages or defaults in the shadow banking
sector may have a material impact on the economic climate in China.

Any of the aforementioned factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Our efforts to expand in certain markets are subject to a variety of business, economic, legal and political_**
**_risks._**

We manufacture our products in many countries and we market and sell our products worldwide. We are
actively operating and expanding our operations in rapidly growing and emerging markets in Asia, Latin
America and Africa. In the future, we expect to generate a greater percentage of our revenues from these markets.

Potential social, political, legal, and economic instability may pose significant risks to our ability to conduct
our business and expand our activities in certain markets. Inherent in our international operations is the risk that
any number of the following circumstances could affect our operations: underdeveloped infrastructure; lack of
qualified management or adequately trained personnel; currency exchange controls, exchange rate fluctuations
and devaluations; changes in local economic conditions; governmental restrictions on foreign investment,
transfer or repatriation of funds; protectionist trade measures, such as anti-dumping measures, duties, tariffs or
embargoes; prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures; changes in laws or regulations and
unpredictable or unlawful government actions; the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables
through foreign legal systems; fraudulent transactions; variations in protection of intellectual property and other
legal rights; potential nationalization of enterprises or other expropriations; and political or social unrest or acts
of sabotage or terrorism.

The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Our international activities increase the compliance risks associated with economic and trade sanctions_**
**_imposed by the United States, the EU and other jurisdictions._**

Our international operations could expose us to trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed
by the United States or other governments or organizations, including the United Nations, the European Union

29


-----

and their member countries. In particular, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets
Control, or OFAC, administers certain laws and regulations that impose restrictions upon U.S. companies and
persons and, in some contexts, foreign entities and persons, with respect to activities or transactions with certain
countries, governments, entities and individuals that are the subject of such sanctions laws and regulations. We
have undertaken in the past and may continue to undertake business in countries subject to U.S. sanctions laws,
including generating revenues in immaterial amounts from customers located in Cuba, Iran, Iraq and other
countries which are the subject of such OFAC sanction laws and regulations. For example, through our Turkish
subsidiary, we generated €8.3 million, €4.1 million and €4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and
2013 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, respectively, from sales to our customers in Iran. In
connection with the Transactions, we are planning to discontinue our sales to customers in Iran. Under economic
and trading sanctions laws, governments may seek to impose modifications to business practices, and
modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to fines,
penalties and other sanctions.

We are monitoring developments in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions that
maintain sanction programs, including developments in the implementation and enforcement of such sanctions
programs. Expansion of sanctions programs, embargoes and other restrictions in the future (including additional
designations of countries subject to sanctions), or modifications in how existing sanctions are interpreted or
enforced may be amended. If any of the risks described above materialize, this could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the
Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We may be exposed to liability under anti-corruption and anti-bribery legislation._**

We are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery legislation and regulations that prohibit companies and
their intermediaries from making improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their
officials and political parties, or others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and other benefits. Due
to our global operations, in particular those in emerging markets, we could face, directly or indirectly, corrupt
demands by officials, militant groups or private entities. Consequently, we face the risk that one or more of our
employees, agents, intermediaries or consultants may make or receive unauthorized payments given that such
persons may not always be subject to our control. In addition, it is possible that we could be held liable for
successor liability for violations committed by companies in which we have invested or acquired or may invest
or acquire.

We are not aware of any current or threatened material investigations or any legitimate grounds that could
give rise to any investigations relating to us or any existing adverse findings against us, our directors, officers,
employees or joint venture partners, but if any such investigations are made and substantiated in the future or any
such persons are found to be involved in corruption or other illegal activity, this could result in criminal or civil
penalties, including substantial monetary fines, against us, our directors, officers and employees.

Any such findings, or any alleged or actual involvement in corrupt practices or other illegal activities by us
or our commercial partners or anyone with whom we conduct business could damage our reputation and our
ability to do business, including by affecting our rights and title to assets or by the loss of key personnel, and
together with any increased compliance costs, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash
flows, financial condition and prospects.

**_Our business, in particular our project business, is dependent on financing being available to our customers._**

We produce, in part, upscale elevator components, for the financing of which our customers require
substantial capital resources or borrowed funds. A significant portion of our business consists of projects that
depend on the financing being available to our customers. A shortage in available financing opportunities, for
example as a result of the European sovereign debt and financial crisis, may make it difficult to carry out such
projects. For the same reason, existing orders may be deferred or cancelled, or customers may experience
payment difficulties. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Our industry is characterized by a significant amount of competition, which could reduce our revenue or put_**
**_continued pressure on our sales prices._**

The market for elevator components in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete with both large
international market participants as well as with numerous smaller regional and local suppliers that vary

30


-----

depending on the region. Our competitive position also varies in the individual product sub-markets (such as submarkets for different types of elevator components and complete elevators) and regions. If we are unable to
continue to provide our services to existing clients, to develop new service portfolios, to attract new clients, to
respond to client trends, to increase our operating efficiency and to reduce our operating and overhead costs, we
may not be able to successfully compete. Furthermore, in many of the markets in which we compete, customers
place a strong emphasis on local manufacturing capabilities, and we may be unable to quickly expand our
manufacturing capacities as required in certain fast-growing regions, and thus lose market share in such regions.
Our expansion in certain markets, such as China and India, which are generally characterized by lower costs of
production, rapid growth and high levels of low-cost, low-quality competition. In addition, many of our
competitors may have the resources to reduce their sales prices to below market-competitive rates to gain market
share.

The level of development in many markets in which we operate is determined to a certain extent by
technological changes and innovation, and our strategy is therefore particularly directed towards being perceived
as a technology leader in the such markets. This requires continuous investments in research and development.
Despite our efforts and investments, existing or new competitors may develop their current products and
technologies further, create alternative products that are more attractively priced, offer products of a higher
quality or a broader functionality than our products or offer products that are more appealing than our products
for other reasons. Furthermore, our research and development may be insufficient to meet our customers’
demands in time, and we may become unable to meet product specifications due to a lack of research and
development expertise. Additionally, our existing competitors and new entrants may have greater operational,
financial and other resources or may otherwise be better positioned to develop new products and compete for
opportunities and, as a result, our business may be less successful. New or better-developed products may
potentially be offered at more attractive prices and, if such products are more attractive than our products for any
other reason such as a higher degree of functionality, demand for our products could fall.

In addition, even though large MNCs primarily focus on the installation of elevators and maintenance
services and we generally are not active in these areas, we may compete with some of our customers with respect
to certain products. As a result, our customers may decide not to purchase our products.

Our customers and end customers face price pressures and cost–cutting pressures. If our competitors are
able to significantly reduce their prices, if new low-cost competition enters the market or if customers decide to
use their own products where we compete with them, we might not be able to reduce our costs, offer similar
pricing or otherwise remain competitive, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We are exposed to risks associated with market trends and developments._**

Our future success depends on our ability to recognize market trends and technological changes and to
develop and bring to the market new and improved products in a timely manner. The elevator components
market, in particular, is characterized by progressive development toward higher levels of performance, energy
efficiency and safety. Among other risks, (i) we may not be successful in developing new products or systems or
in bringing them to market in a timely manner, or at all; (ii) products or technologies developed by others may
render our offerings obsolete or non-competitive; (iii) our customers may substitute our products with competing
products; (iv) the market may not accept our innovations; and (v) our competitors may be able to produce our
non-patented products more inexpensively from other sources. Should we fail to develop appropriate strategies as
a response to these or similar market trends, or should we fail to enhance existing products, develop new
products or keep pace with developing technology, growth opportunities could be lost or we could lose existing
customers. Furthermore, if we devote resources to the pursuit of new technologies and products that fail to be
accepted in the marketplace or that fail to be commercially viable, all or part of these R&D expenses may be lost
and our business may suffer. Any such risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_We depend on large MNCs for the sale of our products._**

Many of our customers are large MNCs, such as Kone, Otis, Schindler and ThyssenKrupp Elevator, as well
as, to a lesser extent, several Asian MNCs, such as Fujitec, Hitachi, Hyundai, Mitsubishi Electric and Toshiba.
Large companies have substantial bargaining power with respect to price and other commercial terms. If, for
example, Kone’s business were to slow down, we would be materially impacted because much of our recent

31


-----

growth has been attributable to the growth of Kone’s business. Our customers’ demand for price reductions
drives us to constantly improve our production processes to reduce cost. If we are not successful in these
improvements, our profit margin may be negatively affected. In addition, if any of our MNC customers becomes
insolvent, discontinues its business relationship with us or terminates a supply contract prematurely, the original
investments made by us to provide such products or outstanding claims against such customer could be wholly or
partially lost.

The timing and amount of sales to our MNC customers ultimately depends on factors that are beyond our
control, including sales levels and shipping schedules for the MNC products into which our products are
incorporated. Our MNC customers may not continue to manufacture products that incorporate our products at
current levels or at all. Failure of our MNC customers to achieve significant sales of elevators and other products
incorporating our components and fluctuations in the timing and volume of such product sales could be harmful
to our business. Further, failure by these customers to inform us of changes to their production needs in a timely
manner could also hinder our ability to effectively manage our business. In addition, we do not carry insurance
on all our receivables. If certain of our customers are unable to make payment against products that we have
already delivered, we may not be able to recover those receivables.

In the nine months ended September 30, 2014, our four largest customers accounted for approximately twothirds of our revenue. Loss of all or a substantial portion of sales made to any of our large MNC customers for
whatever reason would materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to
fulfil our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees. In addition, a continued reduction of prices for
products sold to these customers could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. Factors that could cause such a loss of sales include loss of market share by these
customers, termination of supply agreements and the failure to renegotiate new agreements or new terms, loss of
contracts, insolvency, reduced or delayed customer requirements and plant shutdowns, strikes, or other work
stoppages affecting production by such MNC customers. We may lose all or a portion of sales to our large MNC
customers and we may not be able to offset a continued reduction of prices for products sold to these customers
with reductions in costs.

The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We depend on four customers for two-thirds of our revenues, with one customer providing us with a_**
**_significant proportion of such revenues, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, any of these_**
**_customers would significantly impair our operating results and cash flows._**

Our business depends on our four largest customers for approximately two-thirds of our revenues, with one
of these four customers accounting for a significant proportion of those revenues and a second customer also
representing a significant and growing portion of our revenues. The loss of any of these four key customers, or
any significant reduction in sales to any of them, or any material adverse changes in the financial conditions of
any of them (for example, due to a deterioration of economic conditions in the markets in which they operate,
employment levels, increased taxation or other factors), would have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operation.

Our industry and business are marked by a relatively small number of large customers, and we expect this
high concentration of customers to continue for the foreseeable future. If we were to lose any of our key
customers, we may be unable to find an alternative customer of similar size, or otherwise compensate for such
loss, in a timely manner, or at all. Moreover, in light of the maturity of the European elevator components
market, our ability to win contracts with new customers in the European market would likely turn on whether we
succeed in taking market share from our competitors in Europe, which we may unable to do due to long-term
contracts and exclusivity agreements of our competitors. Additionally, customers in our industry face time and
cost-related barriers to selecting new suppliers for their elevators, as changing suppliers requires new
homologation of such components and the review and adjustment of all maintenance manuals.

If any of our key customers defaults on a material amount of its outstanding payment obligations, our
business, financial condition and results of operation would be materially adversely affected and we may not be
able to compensate in a timely manner, or at all, for the shortfall in liquidity resulting from such a default.

32


-----

**_We depend on a limited number of key suppliers for certain products._**

We require substantial amounts of raw materials, including steel tubing and bars, strip steel, nickel and other
alloys. We are dependent on suppliers for such key parts as motors for the mechanisms we produce as well as
magnets for our drives. We are subject to the risk that any or all of these materials may increase in price or
become unavailable. At present, we source one of our critical supplies from a single supplier. Reliance on a
single supplier cannot always be avoided and, consequently, our dependence on one supplier for any given input
may continue or even increase in the future. Our procurement logistics may experience supply delays,
cancellations, strikes, insufficient quantities or inadequate quality, which could in turn result in interruptions in
production and, therefore, negatively impact our production capacity and cause delays in the delivery of products
to our customers in these areas. If any one of our suppliers becomes unable to meet our delivery requirements for
any reason (for example, due to insolvency, destruction of production plants or refusal to perform, we may be
unable to source input products from other suppliers upon short notice and at the required volume.

In addition, we are dependent on finding the right suppliers to provide the quality that allows us to deliver
the requisite safety standards required by both regulatory and market norms. Furthermore, budget restrictions
may delay the introduction of new safety standards.

The realization of these risks could lead to order cancellations or claims for damages and could harm our
long-term relationships with MNC customers, who may as a result choose to select another supplier. Such an
outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our
ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We are exposed to fluctuations in prices of raw materials._**

Raw material costs constitute a large portion of our production costs, and fluctuations in the price of these
raw materials affect our results of operations. In the year ended December 31, 2013, direct materials (the
accounting term used in our accounts to represent raw material costs) accounted for €240.1 million, or 67.1% of
our cost of sales. The primary raw materials used in our production processes are metal sheets and coils, carbon
steel and stainless steel, but we also purchase other steel products such as steel rolled profiles. Steel products are
our most important commodity and we estimate that steel products accounted for approximately one-third of our
direct material costs in the year ended December 31, 2013. As a result, the market price of steel impacts our
results of operations.

Historically, we have been able to pass costs through to our customers, however, even to the extent that we
are successful in compensating for or passing on our increased costs to our customers by increasing prices, the
positive effects of such price increases for us may not occur in the periods in which the additional expenses have
been incurred, but in later periods. In that event, the price increases will not have a compensating effect for the
periods in which the costs increased. If costs of raw materials rise, and if we are not able to undertake cost saving
measures elsewhere in our operations or increase the selling prices of our products, we will not be able to
mitigate such cost increases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We may not be successful in executing our growth strategy of expanding in growing emerging markets._**

If we are unable to secure sufficient funding to finance our development and growth activities in the future,
we could lose our competitive position in emerging markets. Furthermore, if we invest in emerging markets that
do not develop as expected, or that deteriorate due to economic, political or other reasons, all or part of these
investments may be lost. We also depend on the success of our customers in the emerging markets. Historically,
emerging markets have proven more volatile than developed markets. See “—Risks Related to the Industry in
which We Operate—We face risks in the regions in which we operate, including in emerging markets.”

In addition, the success of our emerging markets growth strategy will depend on attracting and retaining
qualified personnel (including the need to identify, recruit, train and integrate additional employees), maintaining
our high quality standards and implementing our standardized processes and quality management policies
globally. The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

33


-----

**_We are exposed to risks in connection with past and future acquisitions, local sales force, investments and_**
**_reorganizations, as well as strategic partnerships._**

In the past, we have occasionally acquired businesses in order to expand our operations. For example, in
2000, we acquired the Kone plant in Scheibbs (Austria). Acquisitions, investments and reorganizations entail
risks resulting from the integration of employees, processes, technologies and products. Such transactions may
give rise to substantial administrative and other expenses. Such transactions may also result in the need for
additional finance and may impact negatively on financing requirements and the financing structure. We may not
be able to successfully integrate our current and future acquisitions, or they may not be successful.

In the future, we may acquire businesses or undertake investments or reorganizations in a targeted manner.
There is no guarantee, however, that we will be able to identify suitable businesses and to acquire them or
investments on favorable terms. There is also a risk that not all material risks in connection with the acquisition
of a company, the establishment of a joint venture or the making of investments will be identified in the due
diligence process and will not be or could not be sufficiently taken into account in the decision to acquire a
business and in the purchase agreement, or the decision to enter into a joint venture and the joint venture
agreement or make an investment. These risks could materialize only after a company has been acquired or a
joint venture or investment has been entered into, and may not be covered by the warranties in the related
agreements or by insurance policies. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the
Guarantees.

**_Our future business success depends on our ability to deliver high quality products in a timely manner._**

For customers, one of the determining factors in purchasing our components and systems is the high quality
of our products due to their often “mission-critical” nature. We supply a market in which safety is paramount. As
a result, a decrease in quality that causes injury could lead not only to a damage compensation claim but also a
loss of business due to reputational damage. A decrease in the actual or perceived quality of our products could
damage our image and reputation and also the image and reputation of one or more of our brands. Furthermore,
defective products could result in loss of sales, loss of customers and loss of market acceptance. The risks arising
from such warranty and product liability lawsuits, proceedings and other claims are insured up to levels
considered economically reasonable by us. However, the insurance coverage could prove insufficient in
individual cases. In addition, our customers rely on our ability to make timely deliveries of our products to them.
Any delay in the delivery of our products to our customers could result in delays in elevator installations, or even
delays in the relevant project, any of which could adversely affect our reputation.

The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Changes in our product mix or our portfolio of large projects may have a significant impact on our profit_**
**_margins._**

Some of our products have higher profit margins than others. Some of our products also have a much higher
internally manufactured cost component. Therefore, changes in product mix from quarter-to-quarter or from yearto-year could have a significant impact on our reported margins through a change in our manufacturing, costs and
specifically, in our manufacturing costs as a percentage of revenue. In addition, certain large projects make up a
substantial portion of our revenue, and as these projects are phased out, this can also have a significant impact on
our reported revenue and margins for our business units that are active in the project business from quarter-toquarter or from year-to-year. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We may be unable to maintain our advanced technology._**

The markets for the products that we offer are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving
technical standards, changes in customer preferences and the frequent introduction of new products. The
development and commercialization of new technologies and the introduction of new products will often make
existing ones obsolete or unmarketable. Our competitiveness in the future will depend, at least in part, on our
ability to (i) keep pace with rapid technological developments and maintain our state-of-the-art technology,
(ii) develop and manufacture innovative products in a timely and cost-effective manner, (iii) attract and retain
highly capable technical and engineering personnel and (iv) accurately assess the demand for, and perceived
market acceptance of, new products that we develop.

34


-----

Failure to maintain technology standards such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the
Guarantees.

**_We depend on our ability to secure sufficient funding for our research and development efforts._**

Developing new and improved products is very costly and therefore requires a substantial amount of capital
funding. We spend significant resources on R&D. During the years 2013 and 2012, our R&D expenses in
relation to revenues accounted for 1.2% and 1.3%, respectively.

If we devote resources to the pursuit of new technologies and products that fail to be accepted in the
marketplace or that fail to become commercially viable, all or part of these R&D expenses may be lost. Should
we be unable to secure sufficient funding to finance our development activities, we could lose our competitive
position in a number of important and rapidly growing sub-markets. The failure to secure funding for R&D
activity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our
ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Our business could be disrupted or severely impacted by natural disasters._**

If natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, tsunamis and floods), epidemics, radioactive contamination, wars,
terrorist acts, riots and accidents (e.g., fires and explosions) were to occur, we could incur extensive damage to
one or more of our facilities, resulting in a full or partial disruption to our operations for a prolonged period of
time. A seismic risk exists especially with regards to our operations in Turkey and other earthquake-prone zones.
Even if our operations were not directly harmed by such events, confusion in logistic and supply networks,
shortages in the supply of electric power, gas and other utilities, telecommunication problems or problems of
supplier’s production may continue for a long period of time. Accordingly, if delays or disruption in the
procurement of materials and parts, or the production and sales of our products and services, or the deterioration
of the capital raising environment or other adverse developments were to take place as a result of such events,
our business results may be adversely affected. This could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position, results of operation and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the
Guarantees.

**_Our business could be adversely impacted by strikes and other labor disputes._**

Our relationships with our employees and our unions could deteriorate in the future, and we could
experience additional strikes, unionization efforts or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees.
Many of our customers and our other suppliers also have unionized workforces. Refusals to work or work
downtime experienced by our customers or our other suppliers could result in decreased productivity or closures
of our assembly plants where our products are needed for assembly. Salary increases, particularly in emerging
markets, could impact our profitability or our ability to continue operating our plants. This could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations
under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_The safety of our workers is regularly in jeopardy due to the nature of our operations, and we could face_**
**_material adverse effects as a result._**

The workers in our plants who operate heavy machinery often work in dangerous conditions. In 2012 and
2013 for example, our accident rate, defined by employees absent for more than 24 hours as the result of a workrelated injury, was at 113 and 83, respectively. In the month of July, 2014, we had 32 cases of work-related
injuries. We experienced a fatal accident in our plant in Argentina in 2013 and a fatal accident in China in 2014.
The installation of safety measures and policies aimed at decreasing such injuries, including traffic lights, safety
corners, hazard clothing and designated safety managers will not be sufficient to eliminate all work-related
injuries. As a result, if work-related injuries linked to our own negligence occur, we could suffer lawsuits from
our employees, their beneficiaries, regulatory agencies or other parties which could have a material impact on our
results and damage our reputation. Accordingly, any event negatively impacting the safety of our workers could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill
our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Our operations rely on complex IT systems and networks._**

We rely heavily on centralized, standardized information technology systems, IT integration and networks
to support business processes, as well as to facilitate internal and external communications. These systems and

35


-----

networks are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, and to security threats.
We are prone to interference by third parties or computer virus infections at the facilities and in the regions in
which we operate. An extended outage in a data center or telecommunications network utilized by our systems,
any security breaches or any similar event could lead to an extended unanticipated interruption of our systems or
networks. The realization of any risks related to our IT system and network disruptions could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations
under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We rely on the security of our information, Intellectual Property and Research and Development._**

We may obtain confidential information concerning our customers and individuals in the ordinary course of
our business. We hold confidential business and technological intellectual property (“IP”), much of which is the
product of our R&D. To forestall unauthorized access by means of cyber-attacks, tampering, destruction, leakage
and losses, we employ safety measures, including implementing technological safety measures such as access
rights and tracking systems, as well as strengthening our information management capabilities. However, when
our network and information systems crash or other problems, such as a leak of confidential information
concerning customers and individuals, occur, we may become liable for damages, or our reputation or customers’
confidence in us may be adversely affected. In addition, if our R&D, confidential business or technological
information were leaked or misused by a third party, or if our intellectual properties were infringed upon by a
third party, or we were held liable for infringing on a third party’s intellectual property rights, our business
results may be adversely affected. For our Group, such risk is especially prevalent in emerging markets, and in
particular, China. Any breach in the security of our information, IP and R&D could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the
Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We are dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified senior management, key employees and_**
**_personnel._**

We depend on senior executive officers and other key personnel, including our skilled R&D employees, to
operate and grow our business and to develop new enhancements, offerings and technologies. Our R&D staff, for
example, currently consists of approximately 104 employees, with significant expertise relating to our operations,
of which 75 are graduated engineers. The success of our R&D activities is particularly dependent on our ability
to attract and retain sufficient numbers of high-quality researchers and development specialists, and we face
significant competition for highly qualified personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government
entities and other organizations. We may not be able to successfully attract and retain such personnel.
Considerable expertise could be lost if we cannot attract and retain such talent or such talent may be gained by
competitors. In addition, we rely on our CEO and Chairman of the Executive Management Board, Dr. Walter
Rohregger, our CFO Dr. Daniel Wiest, as well as experienced senior management personnel. There is a risk that
any such key individuals may leave our Group. The loss of any such key personnel or the inability to attract and
retain highly skilled employees required for our activities could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Property loss and unforeseen business or transportation interruption could adversely affect us._**

Damage and loss caused by fire, accidents, natural disasters, terrorism, severe weather or other disruptions
of our production process at our facilities or within our supply chain, with respect to customers and with
suppliers, can be severe. Such risks arising from business interruption and loss of production are insured at levels
considered economically reasonable by us, but our insurance coverage could prove insufficient in individual
cases. Such events could injure or kill individuals or damage or destroy third party property or the environment,
which could, among other things, lead to considerable financial costs for us. In addition, our manufacturing
processes are dependent on critical pieces of equipment such as furnaces, as well as electrical equipment such as
transformers and this equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures, which
may result in production bottlenecks and breakdowns.

The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**Legal, Taxation and Environmental Risks**

**_We are exposed to warranty and product liability claims._**

As a manufacturer, we are subject to product liability lawsuits and other proceedings alleging violations of
due care, violations of warranty obligations, treatment errors and claims arising from breaches of contract, recall
actions or fines imposed by government or regulatory authorities. For example, we are currently litigating a claim
brought by one of our customers in relation to a product manufactured by one of our subsidiaries, Wittur Electric
Drives GmbH. This customer has asserted that motors produced and delivered by Wittur Electric Drives GmbH
failed to comply with certain quality requirements and claims damages of approximately €1.2 million. Any such
lawsuits, proceedings and other claims could result in significant costs for us. In addition, defective products
could result in loss of revenue, loss of customers and loss of market acceptance, in particular, because many of
our products are mission-critical components which often have a major impact on the overall safety, durability
and performance of our customers’ end-product. The risks arising from such warranty and product liability
lawsuits, proceedings and other claims are insured up to levels we consider economically reasonable, but the
insurance coverage could prove insufficient in individual cases. Any major defect in one of our products could
also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and market perception.

We manufacture many products pursuant to MNC customer specifications and quality requirements. If the
products manufactured and delivered by us do not meet the requirements stipulated by our MNC customers at the
agreed date of delivery, production of the relevant products is generally discontinued until the cause of the
product defect has been identified and remedied. Moreover, our MNC customers could potentially bring claims
for damages on the basis of breach of contract, even if the cause of the defect is remedied at a later point in time.
Failure to perform with respect to quality requirements could negatively affect the market acceptance of our other
products and our market reputation in various market segments.

The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Antitrust or competition-related claims or investigations could result in changes to business procedure and_**
**_defending such claims could be costly._**

We are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws and regulations in the countries where we
operate. These laws and regulations seek to prevent and prohibit anti-competitive activity, including merger
control relating to acquisitions and prevention of abuses of a dominant market position. We may incur
infringements of such laws and regulations in connection with our operations. Such behavior may lead to
antitrust or competition-related claims and investigations, which can be costly in terms of time and expense.
Following such a claim or investigation, we may be required to change the way in which we offer a particular
product or service. If we are found to have violated antitrust or competition laws or regulations, we may be
subject to fines or penalties. Any antitrust or competition-related claim or investigation could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations
under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We could be unsuccessful in adequately protecting our intellectual property and technical expertise._**

Our products and services are highly dependent upon our technological know-how and the scope and
limitations of our proprietary rights in respect thereof. We have obtained and continue to apply for a large
number of intellectual property rights, such as patents, that are of considerable importance to our business. The
process of seeking patent protection can be lengthy and expensive. Patents may not be granted on currently
pending or future applications or may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with meaningful
protection or a commercial advantage. In addition, while there is a presumption that patents are valid, the
granting of a patent does not necessarily imply that it is effective or that possible patent claims can be enforced to
the degree necessary or desired. A significant number of our know-how and industrial secrets is not patented and
cannot be protected through intellectual property rights. Consequently, there is a risk that third parties, in
particular competitors, will copy our know-how without incurring any expenses of their own.

We have entered into a number of license, cross-license, cooperation and development agreements with our
customers, competitors and other third parties under which we are granted access to intellectual property or
know-how of such third parties. It is possible that license agreements could be terminated under circumstances
such as a licensing partner’s insolvency or bankruptcy or in the event of a change of control in either party,
leaving us with reduced access to intellectual property rights to commercialize our own technologies.

37


-----

The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_There is a risk that we infringe intellectual property rights of third parties._**

Competitors, suppliers and customers submit a large number of inventions for intellectual property
protection. It is not always possible to determine with certainty whether there are effective and enforceable
third-party intellectual property rights to certain processes, methods or applications. Third parties could assert
infringement claims, including illegitimate ones, against us. As a result, we could be required to cease
manufacturing, using or marketing the relevant technologies or products in certain countries or be forced to make
changes to manufacturing processes or products. We could be liable to pay compensation for infringements or
could be forced to purchase licenses to make use of technology from third parties. Intellectual property rights
infringements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and
our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We might not have validly acquired employee inventions or could fail to validly acquire them in the future._**

There is a risk that we have failed or will fail to properly utilize inventions of our employees. For example,
due to our failure to properly claim employee inventions as required pursuant to applicable law, present or former
employees of our German operations who made employee inventions might continue to be the owners of the
valuable rights to these inventions. This risk is of particular importance to the extent it affects our 18 patent
families that we have designated as being of high importance to our business and nine patent families of medium
importance. If an invention is deemed to be that of an employee, and we nevertheless registered as the owner of
such patent or utility model and/or used an employee invention as such, then the employee who made the
invention might have a claim for transfer of the patent or utility model against us, and might be able to assert
claims for damages for the unauthorized use of his or her invention (e.g., disgorgement of profits or notional
license fees). In addition, a claim could be asserted against us to enjoin our use of the invention, or we could be
forced to enter into a license agreement providing for the payment of royalties in order to use the invention in the
future, or we might have to acquire the invention. There is a risk that employees may have claims for employee
invention compensation which have not yet been fully satisfied. If we should have failed to have validly acquired
employee inventions or should potentially fail to validly acquire them in the future, or if employees should have
claims for employee invention compensation which have not been fully satisfied, this could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations
under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We may incur additional costs as a result of works council and industry collective bargaining agreements_**
**_applicable to some of our European employees._**

If works council agreements or industry collective bargaining agreements which apply to us, particularly in
Italy, Austria, Spain and Germany, are amended to the effect that they foresee higher benefits for employees in
the future, this may lead to higher employment costs and higher social security contributions for the past and
future with regard to our employees being subject to such collective bargaining agreements. The realization of
any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations
and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We are subject to mandatory pension liabilities required by domestic laws in both Austria and Italy._**

We offer retirement benefits to our employees in Austria and Italy in accordance with the applicable law.
Under Italian law, upon termination of employment, employees are entitled to receive a mandatory severance
payment based upon salary and years of service under the Trattamento di fine rapporto (“TFR”). Our expenses
for defined contribution pension plans relate to our contributions to statutory retirement pensions. According to
Austrian Law, we are obliged to reimburse all employment related expenses (Aufwand für die Dienstbezüge) of
civil servant employees to the federal administration of the Republic of Austria. These reimbursements include
the contribution to the federal pension system for civil servants working for us in respect of the future pension
entitlements of these civil servants. Such required reimbursements are subject to future fluctuations and could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill
our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We are subject to risks from legal, administrative and arbitration proceedings._**

We are involved in certain legal, administrative and arbitration proceedings and could become involved in
additional legal, administrative and arbitration proceedings. These proceedings or potential proceedings could

38


-----

involve substantial claims for damages or other payments. Based on a judgment or a settlement agreement, we
could be obligated to pay substantial damages. Our litigation costs and those of third parties could also be
significant. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and
our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the many jurisdictions in which we operate, and we may_**
**_be adversely affected by changes regarding applicable legal and regulatory requirements._**

Numerous laws and regulations apply to our facilities and business operations in the various jurisdictions in
which we operate. We are subject to the laws applicable to commercial enterprises including, in particular, laws
relating to taxation and customs, land utilization and planning, occupational health and safety, security, quality
and liability, transportation, work and employment practices (including pensions), competition and numerous
provisions of product, regulatory and environmental laws. In addition, the types of services which we are
permitted to perform may be subject to legal and regulatory requirements. Compliance with these numerous
statutory provisions and other legal and regulatory requirements requires significant effort and expense. Although
we believe we have taken adequate measures to train and instruct employees regarding conduct issues,
employees may not act in compliance with applicable statutory provisions (including antitrust regulation and
anti-corruption legislation) and other legal and regulatory requirements, as well as corporate policies, and we
face the risk that penalties or liabilities may be imposed on us. We may face irregularities and compliance issues
at our group companies.

In the case of economic sanctions or boycotts imposed by the United Nations, the United States or the
European Union on certain countries, we may be unable to distribute our products in such jurisdictions. Existing
and proposed legislation and regulation, some of which may vary considerably from country to country, may also
increase our cost of doing business. Any amendment to, and in particular a tightening of, such provisions—
including changes in the manner in which such legislation and regulations are interpreted by courts—could
complicate operational procedures. The resulting adverse effect on the marketability of our services or the
resulting increase in our compliance costs and tax burden, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the
Guarantees.

**_We could incur liabilities under environmental laws and regulations, including liability for soil, water or_**
**_groundwater contamination or for risks related to hazardous materials._**

Many of the sites at which we operate have been used for industrial purposes for many years, leading to
risks of contamination and the resulting site restoration obligations. In addition, we could be held responsible for
the remediation of areas adjacent to our sites. Competent authorities could assert claims against us, as the owner
or tenant of the affected plots, for the examination or remediation of such soil or groundwater contamination, or
order us to dispose of or treat contaminated soil excavated in the course of construction. We could also be
required to indemnify the owners of plots leased by us or of other properties, if the authorities were to pursue
claims against the relevant owner of the property and if we caused the contamination. Although we are not aware
of any sites at which we have material cleanup obligations, costs typically incurred in connection with such
claims are generally difficult to predict, and we could incur additional costs as a result of contamination or
additional cleanup obligations that are imposed in the future. Also, if any contamination became a subject of
public discussion, there is a risk that our reputation or relations with our customers could be harmed.

The health and safety of third parties (such as former employees) may be affected by the use of potentially
hazardous materials. For example, building materials containing asbestos were identified at our former
warehouse in Rome. Under Italian law, employers are required to ensure that employees are not exposed to
asbestos and, in case of any exposure, the employer is obliged to implement measures necessary to avoid any
risks of asbestos-related diseases. Although we have not been notified of any asbestos-related claims as of the
date of this Offering Memorandum, we could be exposed to such claims, whether related to asbestos or other
types of contamination, in the future. We face similar risks with respect to former sites sold in the past. We also
could be held responsible for currently unknown contamination at properties we own or use that we previously
owned or used.

The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

39


-----

**_We could become subject to additional burdensome or costly environmental, safety or other regulations and_**
**_additional regulation could adversely affect demand for our products and services._**

We must observe and comply with a large number of different regulatory systems across the world that
change frequently and are continuously evolving and becoming more stringent, in particular with respect to
environmental regulations, chemicals and hazardous materials, as well as health regulations. This also applies to
air, water and soil pollution regulations and to waste legislation, all of which have recently become more
stringent through new laws. All of our major plants are certified according to the European Management and
Audit Scheme (“EMAS”) system and certified according to ISO 14001, except that certification in our plant in
Argentina is expected to follow in early 2015 and in Brazil in early 2016 once we complete our new plant there.
Our plant in India is expected to receive the ISO certificate in early 2015 after approval. Wittur Turkey is
expected to be certified within the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, for our sites and operations, we
require various permits and must comply with the requirements specified therein. In the past, adjusting to comply
with new requirements has required significant investments and we assume that further significant investments in
this regard will be required in the future. We also could incur fines or other sanctions as a result of violations of
environmental requirements.

The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**Risks Related to Our Financial Profile**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from_**
**_fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees._**

After the issuance of the Notes, we will be highly leveraged. As of September 30, 2014, after giving effect
to the Transactions and the application of the proceeds from the Financing, we would have had total debt of
€420.0 million. The terms of the Indenture and the Senior Facilities will permit the Issuer and its restricted
subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including in respect of committed borrowings of up to
€65.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Capitalization.”

The degree to which we will be leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important
consequences for holders of the Notes, including the following:

    - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes;

    - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic
and industry conditions;

    - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund
working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product research and development or other general
corporate purposes;

    - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

    - placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not
as highly leveraged; and

    - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_The Issuer is dependent upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet its obligations on the Notes and the Notes_**
**_Guarantees._**

The Issuer is a company with limited business operations and it depends upon the receipt of sufficient funds
from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations. We intend to provide funds to the Issuer in order to meet the
obligations on the Notes primarily through payments under the Proceeds Loan. Given our Group’s global
operations, we have a large number of operating subsidiaries and business participations, which individually
contribute to our Group’s results. Therefore, in order to be able to meet its obligations to pay interest and
principal to you under the Notes, the Issuer will be dependent on the operating subsidiaries and business of the

40


-----

Target and its subsidiaries. If the Proceeds Loan or dividends or other intercompany loans do not distribute
sufficient cash to the Issuer to make scheduled payments on the Notes, the ability of the Issuer to make payments
may be limited.

Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of
these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. In particular, the Senior Facilities limit the ability to
upstream cash to the Issuer apart from specific exemptions, including to service debt of the Issuer up to a cap
specified by the Senior Facilities. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation.
Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or
distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Issuer’s
subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuer will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves
available to it. Under German law, all dividends may only be distributed out of current profits and distributable
reserves, and, generally, interim dividend distributions are not allowed under German law. The subsidiaries of
the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes.

The inability to transfer cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that,
even though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet their obligations, they may not be
permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity in their restricted group to another entity in their
restricted group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations.

The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and_**
**_capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Indenture will restrict, among other things, our ability to:

    - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

    - create or incur certain liens;

    - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of the
Issuers or their restricted subsidiaries;

    - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

    - make certain investments;

    - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or
advances to, and on the transfer of, assets to the Issuer;

    - sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries;

    - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

    - consolidate or merge with other entities;

    - impair security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes;

    - guarantee certain indebtedness; and

    - layer certain indebtedness.

All these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future
operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our
interest. In particular, our ability to incur debt at our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes (including
subsidiaries in China) will be limited, and therefore could limit our ability to execute our growth strategy in such
regions. Certain of the covenants under the Indenture and the Senior Facilities impose limitations based on euro
amounts (e.g., the amount of additional indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur). As such, if the euro were
to significantly decrease in value, the restrictions imposed by these covenants would become tighter, further
restricting our ability to finance our operations and conduct our day-to-day business.

The Senior Facilities also contain restrictive covenants that, in most cases, are more restrictive than the
covenants contained in the Indenture. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Senior Facilities,
subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors

41


-----

could cancel the availability of the facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior
Facilities, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, any default or acceleration
under the Senior Facilities could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that
contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indenture (in the case of an acceleration). If
our creditors, including the creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement, accelerate the payment of those
amounts or, in the case of letters of credit, require the provision of cash collateral, we cannot assure you that our
assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay or, as the case may be, pay in full those
amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments
to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part.

If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under our Senior Facilities
Agreement will also have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them securing the indebtedness
owed to them. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, obligations under the Notes and the
Guarantees will be deemed to be secured on a second-priority basis to obligations under the Senior Facilities and
certain hedging obligations and additional senior financial indebtedness permitted to be incurred in the future. As
a result, enforcement proceeds from the Shared Collateral will be applied first to the indebtedness under the
Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations and, if any such additional financial indebtedness is incurred,
then to such additional indebtedness in respect of second lien obligations, in each case, before any distributions
are made on our obligations under the Notes. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors
could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to meet our obligations under our indebtedness and to sustain_**
**_our operations, which we may not be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Senior
Facilities and our obligations under the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations, will depend on our future
performance and our ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial,
competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors, as well as other factors discussed in these “Risk
Factors,” many of which are beyond our control. The Notes will mature in 2023. See “Description of the Notes.”
At the maturity of the Notes, or at the maturity of any other debt which we incur, if we do not have sufficient
cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity
needs, or if we are otherwise restricted from doing so due to corporate, tax or contractual limitations, we may be
required to refinance our indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain
such refinancing on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities or capital
expenditures, sell assets or raise additional debt or equity financing in amounts that could be substantial. The
type, timing and terms of any future financing will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the
financial markets. We may not be able to accomplish any of these measures in a timely manner or on
commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our Senior Facilities Agreement, the Indenture
and any future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these measures.

Any of the aforementioned risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future,_**
**_which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate_**
**_our businesses._**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. We have the ability to borrow up to €65.0 million
under our Revolving Credit Facility, which will be secured by the Shared Collateral and other collateral provided
by the Group, and the Senior Facilities and the Indenture also permit the incurrence of an additional
€50.0 million facility thereunder. The Indenture and the Senior Facilities also permit us to incur a substantial
amount of indebtedness at subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and to incur indebtedness that shares in
the Collateral or that benefits from security interests over assets that do not secure the Notes. Any debt that our
subsidiaries incur could be structurally or effectively senior to the Notes to the extent that such subsidiaries do
not guarantee the Notes, and other debt could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes. Although the Senior

42


-----

Facilities Agreement and the Indenture will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness,
these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain
circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be
substantial. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks that we now
face would increase. In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indenture will not prevent us from
incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Our inability to service our debt
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to
fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We are exposed to liquidity risks._**

We are exposed to liquidity risk in that we may be unable to meet payment obligations because we have
insufficient cash funds at our disposal. Cash funds are arranged and credit lines managed on the basis of a
multiyear financial plan and a rolling month-by-month cash forecast. The inability to ensure sufficient liquidity
reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our
ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees. See “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

**_Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro, the potential re-introduction of individual_**
**_currencies within the Eurozone, or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely could have adverse_**
**_consequences for us with respect to our outstanding debt obligations, such as the Notes, that are euro-_**
**_denominated._**

As a result of the credit crisis in Europe, in particular in Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, the
European Commission created the European Financial Stability Facility (the “EFSF”) and the European
Financial Stability Mechanism (the “EFSM”) to provide funding to Eurozone countries in financial difficulties
that seek such support. In March 2011, the European Council agreed on the need for Eurozone countries to
establish a permanent stability mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism (the “ESM”), to be activated by
mutual agreement and to assume the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing external financial assistance to
Eurozone countries after June 2013. In December 2011, the European Council and each Eurozone country agreed
to a package of measures designed to restore confidence and address the continued tensions in financial markets,
including (i) bringing forward implementation of the ESM from June 2013 to as soon as Member States
representing 90% of the capital commitments to the ESM have ratified the ESM treaty, which occurred on
September 27, 2012, and (ii) a new fiscal compact between all 19 Eurozone countries (with restricted application
to Latvia and Lithuania) and, subject to parliamentary vote, all other non-Eurozone countries (except the United
Kingdom) to put deficit restrictions on Member State budgets, with associated sanctions for those Members
States who violate the specified limits. Despite these measures, concerns persist regarding the debt burden of
certain Eurozone countries (including, most recently, Cyprus and Slovenia), and their ability to meet future
financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the
diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Member States. These and other concerns could lead
to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Member States or, possibly, the dissolution of the
euro entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodominated obligations and for parties subject to other contractual provisions referencing the euro such a supply
contracts would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market
perceptions concerning these and related issues could have adverse consequences for us with respect to our
outstanding debt obligations that are euro-denominated, such as the Notes, and, as we have a substantial amount
of debt denominated in euro, our financial condition may be materially affected. In January 2015, the European
Central Bank announced a large asset-buying program, similar to the “quantitative easing” program undertaken
by the U.S. Treasury. Upon this announcement, the value of the euro fell against other major currencies. The
future effects of this asset-buying program are unknown, but they could lead to increased volatility, a decline in
the value of the euro or inflation in the Eurozone. In addition, such measures may not be successful in assuaging
concerns about sovereign debt in Europe.

The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees

**_We are exposed to risks associated with changes in currency exchange rates and hedging._**

We operate a global business and are therefore exposed to financial risks that arise from changes in
exchange rates. Currency exchange fluctuations could cause losses if assets denominated in currencies with a

43


-----

falling exchange rate lose value, while at the same time liabilities denominated in currencies with a rising
exchange rate appreciate. In addition, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could enhance or minimize
fluctuations in the prices of raw materials, since we purchase a considerable part of the raw materials which we
source in foreign currencies. As a result of these factors, fluctuations in exchange rates could affect our results of
operations.

External and internal transactions involving the delivery of products and services to or by third parties result
in cash inflows and outflows which are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency, the euro.

The future use of derivative hedging instruments by us is generally dependent on the availability of adequate
credit lines with appropriate financial institutions. As a result, we could be unable to use derivative financial
instruments in the future, to the extent necessary, and our hedging strategy could therefore ultimately be
adversely impacted. Furthermore, any hedging transactions executed in the form of derivative financial
instruments may negatively impact our profit due to changes in the market-to-market valuation if hedge
accounting is not applied.

In addition, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks arising from external and internal loan agreements,
which result from cash inflows and outflows in currencies other than the functional currency of our respective
group member. These foreign exchange risks are, in general, hedged against by using appropriate derivative
financial instruments, particularly currency forwards or swaps and cross currency interest-rate swaps.

Our net foreign investments are generally not hedged against exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, a
number of our consolidated companies report their results in currencies other than the euro, which requires us to
convert the relevant items into euro when preparing our consolidated financial statements. Translation risks are
generally not hedged.

The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We may have to repay investment grants and subsidies, or previously awarded investment grants may not be_**
**_disbursed in part or at all._**

Part of our investment requirements for developing and expanding our production capacity is covered by
public aid, such as subsidies, loans at favorable conditions or tax reductions or exemptions. The decisions on
granting public aid received by us contain various conditions such as the creation of jobs or specific research and
development activities. If these conditions are not fulfilled during the commitment period, which generally
exceeds the specified investment period, this could result in a repayment claim by the relevant authorities for the
public aid received by us. During the commitment period, such conditions may no longer be satisfied and we
could be subsequently exposed to considerable repayment claims. This could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and
the Guarantees.

**Risks Related to the Transactions**

**_The Acquisition is subject to significant uncertainties and risks._**

On December 22, 2014, BidCo, an entity indirectly owned by Bain Capital and the direct, wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Issuer, entered into the Acquisition Agreement with TriWay HoldCo AB, Way Equity GmbH &
Co KG and Way Shareholder Loan I GmbH & Co KG, to acquire all the issued and outstanding capital stock of
the Target and certain shareholder loans (the “Acquisition”). The consummation of the Acquisition is subject to
the satisfaction of certain conditions, including regulatory approval in Germany, Austria, Finland, Brazil, China
and Turkey. In addition, the Transaction will be subject to certain statutory conditions, such as regulatory
approval in Turkey. The parties to the Acquisition Agreement will not consummate the Acquisition until the
conditions are fulfilled, which may, potentially, take a number of months and, in exceptional circumstances,
significantly longer. Should the parties to the Acquisition Agreement fail to obtain regulatory approval, certain
subsidiaries of the Target might be sold or spun-off, which might lead to the loss of operational synergies and
might adversely affect the Wittur Group’s financial position and results of operations. Accordingly, the parties
may not be able to undertake this transaction in a timely fashion, without remedies, or at all. Any such remedies
may make the Acquisition less attractive. In addition, regulatory approval of the Acquisition in Turkey is, unlike
regulatory approval in Germany, Austria, Finland, Brazil and China, not a condition precedent under the

44


-----

Acquisition Agreement. As a result, if regulatory approval in Turkey is not obtained and the consummation of the
Acquisition is delayed or barred, the Sellers may claim damages from us and such claims may be successful. The
realization of any risks related to uncertainties of the Acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the
Guarantees.

**_The Issuer does not currently control the Wittur Group and will not control the Wittur Group until completion_**
**_of the Acquisition._**

The Wittur Group is currently ultimately controlled by TriWay HoldCo AB, a majority of which is owned
by the Triton Funds. The Issuer will not obtain control of the Wittur Group until completion of the Acquisition.
TriWay HoldCo AB may not operate the business of the Wittur Group during the interim period from signing of
the Acquisition Agreement until completion of the Acquisition in the same way that we would. Some information
contained in this Offering Memorandum has been derived from public sources and, in the case of historical
information relating to the Wittur Group, has been provided to us by TriWay HoldCo AB, the Target and the
Target’s subsidiaries, and the Issuer has relied on such information supplied to it in its preparation of this
Offering Memorandum. Furthermore, the Transactions themselves have required, and will likely continue to
require, substantial time and focus from management, which could adversely affect their ability to operate the
business. Likewise, employees may be uncomfortable with the Transactions or feel otherwise affected by it,
which could have an impact on work quality and retention.

In addition, prior to the Completion Date, the Wittur Group will not be subject to the covenants described in
“Description of the Notes” to be included in the Indenture. As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to such date,
the Wittur Group will not take any action that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those
covenants been applicable. Any of the risks associated with the Issuer’s lack of control until the completion of
the Acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and
our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and Guarantees.

**_If the conditions to the escrow are not satisfied, the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes, which means_**
**_that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes._**

The gross proceeds from the Offering will be held in escrow accounts for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes pending the satisfaction of certain conditions, some of which are outside of our control. Completion of the
Acquisition is one of the conditions to the release of the proceeds from escrow. If the Acquisition is not
consummated on or before September 30, 2015 or in the event of certain other events that trigger escrow
termination, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption as described in “Description of the
Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and you may not obtain the return you expect to
receive on the Notes.

The escrow funds will be initially limited to the gross proceeds of the Offering and will not be sufficient to
pay the special mandatory redemption price, which is equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the date of special
mandatory redemption. In the event that the escrow funds are insufficient to pay the special mandatory
redemption price, plus any such accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, Bain Capital will be
required to make an equity contribution in an amount requirement to enable the Issuer to pay such accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, owing to the holders of the Notes.

Your decision to invest in the Notes is made at the time of purchase. Changes in the business or financial
condition of the Wittur Group, or the terms of the Acquisition or the financing thereof, between the closing of the
Offering and the Completion Date, may have an impact on our creditworthiness, and you will not be able to
rescind your decision to invest in the Notes as a result thereof.

**_If we do not satisfy the conditions precedent for utilization of the Senior Facilities, we may be required to seek_**
**_alternative sources of financing to ensure sufficient liquidity reserves._**

While we will enter into the Senior Facilities Agreement and material documents related thereto (including
the Intercreditor Agreement) on or prior to the Issue Date, we may not satisfy the conditions precedent to
utilization of the Senior Facilities made available under the Senior Facilities Agreement. If we do not meet the
conditions precedent to utilization of the Senior Facilities, we will need to seek alternative sources of financing to
ensure sufficient liquidity reserves. We may be unable to find such alternative financing, and even if we could

45


-----

obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Any alternative
financing could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, restricting
our business operations. The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the
Guarantees.

**_The Acquisition will entitle our customers and certain other business partners of the Wittur Group to_**
**_terminate their agreements as a result of change of control provisions._**

The Acquisition will constitute a change of control under certain agreements entered into by the Target and
its subsidiaries including agreements with customers, certain lessors, suppliers and a factoring bank. These
counterparties will be entitled to terminate their agreements with us. Some of these counterparties may exercise
their termination rights, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and business following the
Acquisition. In particular, our “share-of-wallet” agreements with MNCs will be subject to such termination
rights. If any of these MNCs decide to exercise its termination rights, it would have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfil our obligations under the Notes. See
“—Risks Related to the Industry in which We Operate—We are dependent on a small number of significant
customers” and “Our Business—Material Agreements with Customers.”

**_Amendments made to the Acquisition Agreement may have adverse consequences for holders of the Notes._**

The Acquisition is expected to be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement.
See “The Transactions.” However, the Acquisition Agreement may be amended and the closing conditions may
be waived at any time by the parties thereto, without the consent of holders of the Notes. Furthermore, any
amendments made to the Acquisition Agreement may make the Acquisition less attractive. Any amendment
made to the Acquisition Agreement may be materially adverse to holders of the Notes, which, in turn, could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our
obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We may not be able to enforce claims relating to a breach of the representations and warranties that the_**
**_Sellers have provided to us under the Acquisition Agreement._**

In connection with the Acquisition, the Sellers have given certain customary representations and warranties
in the Acquisition Agreement related to their shares, the Target and the Target’s business. We may not be able to
enforce any claims against the Sellers relating to breaches of these representations and warranties. The Sellers’
liability under the Acquisition Agreement is very limited. Moreover, even if we are able to eventually recover
any losses resulting from a breach of these representations and warranties, we may temporarily be required to
bear these losses ourselves.

**_We may have liabilities that are not known to us._**

There may be liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence
investigations into the Wittur Group in connection with the Acquisition. We may learn of additional information
about the Wittur Group that adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to
compliance with applicable laws. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations
under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure**

**_Investors’ right to receive payment under the Guarantees is contractually subordinated to senior debt,_**
**_including such Guarantor’s obligations under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations._**

The obligations of the Guarantors under their respective Guarantees will be contractually subordinated in
right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all existing and future obligations in respect of senior debt
of such Guarantor. This senior debt includes certain hedging obligations of such Guarantor and, in respect of a
Guarantor that is a borrower under the Senior Facilities, such Guarantor’s obligations thereunder.

Although the Indenture contains restrictions on the Guarantor’s ability to incur additional debt, any
additional debt incurred may be substantial and senior to the Guarantees. For a summary of the terms of, and
subordination provisions relating to, the Notes and the Guarantees, see “Description of the Notes—Subordination
on the Basis of the Intercreditor Agreement.”

46


-----

Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of a Guarantor in respect of an insolvency event, the holders
of senior debt of such Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full from the assets of such Guarantor before any
payment may be made pursuant to such Guarantee for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. Until the senior
debt of such Guarantor is paid in full, any distribution to which holders of the Notes would be entitled but for the
subordination provisions to be included in the Intercreditor Agreement shall instead be made to holders of senior
debt of such Guarantor as their interests may appear. As a result, in the event of insolvency of a Guarantor,
holders of senior debt of such Guarantor may recover more, ratably, than the holders of Notes, in respect of the
Guarantor’s Guarantee in respect thereof.

In addition, the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the Guarantees will
provide:

    - customary turnover provisions by the Trustee and the holders of the Notes for the benefit of the holders
of senior debt of such Guarantor;

    - that if a payment default on any senior debt of a Guarantor has occurred and is continuing, such
Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of its Guarantee until such default is cured or waived;

    - that if any other default occurs and is continuing on any designated senior indebtedness that permits the
holders thereof to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a written notice of such default, such
Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of the Notes, or pursuant to its Guarantee, until the
earlier of the waiver or cure of such default and 179 days after the date on which the applicable
payment blockage notice is received; and

    - that the holders of the Notes and the Trustee are prohibited, without the prior consent of the majority
senior creditors, from taking any enforcement action in relation to such Guarantee, except in certain
circumstances.

The Indenture will also provide that, except under very limited circumstances, only the Trustee will have
standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Notes and the Guarantees. Moreover, the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Indenture will restrict the rights of holders of the Notes to initiate insolvency proceedings or
take legal actions against each of the Guarantors and by accepting any Note each such holder will be deemed to
have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies
and recourse under the Guarantees in the event of a default by the Issuer or a Guarantor.

**_The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as security for_**
**_the Notes, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the Notes and such Collateral may be_**
**_reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

The Notes will be secured by (i) on a first-priority basis, the Notes Collateral consisting of (A) the Escrow
Charge, (B) a pledge of the shares of the Issuer and (C) a pledge of the bank accounts of the Issuer and (ii) on a
second-priority basis pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, (A) a pledge of the shares of BidCo,
(B) a security interest in respect of the Proceeds Loan, (C) a pledge of the bank accounts of BidCo and (D) the
assignment of claims under the Acquisition Agreement (in each case, subject to the Agreed Security Principles).
Most of our assets will not form part of the Collateral and thus not secure the Notes.

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with the Transaction and the value
of the Collateral in the event of an enforcement of the security interests created over the Collateral, or a
liquidation of the entities holding the Collateral, is subject to fluctuations and will depend on market and
economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. Such factors include, among others, conditions
in the capital equipment industry, the ability to sell collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in
which the Collateral is located, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. In
addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time. By its nature, portions of the Collateral may be
illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. For example, the shares and other Collateral that are
pledged or assigned or transferred for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited
repayment of the Notes, in part because most of these shares or other assets may not be liquid and their value to
other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be
saleable or, even if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Furthermore, any
shares pledged to secure the Notes and the Guarantees may have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar proceedings because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been
pledged must first be satisfied, potentially leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result,

47


-----

the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of
an enforcement sale. The value of the Collateral may not be sufficient for the proceeds from an enforcement of
the security interests created over the Collateral to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes. In
addition, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, in the event of any distribution of the proceeds from the
sale of certain Collateral, the lenders under the Senior Facilities will be entitled to receive from such distribution
payment in full in cash before the holders of the Notes will be entitled to receive any payment from such
distribution.

Moreover, the value of the Collateral may be diluted. The Indenture will permit the granting of certain liens
over the Collateral other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes. To the extent that holders of other
secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the
Indenture or the security documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to
the Collateral that, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes.
Similarly, if we issue additional notes under the Indenture, holders of such additional notes would benefit from
the same collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from
the liens on the Collateral.

**_Your security interests over the Shared Collateral rank behind the security interests benefiting the lenders_**
**_under the Senior Facilities and your rights to enforce your security over the Shared Collateral are limited._**

The Shared Collateral is pledged (i) on a second-priority basis pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, to the Shared Security Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Notes and (ii) on a first-priority
basis, to the holders of debt under the Senior Facilities and certain of the Issuer’s and its subsidiaries’ hedging
obligations. Under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents, the proceeds of any sale of the
Shared Collateral on enforcement will be applied, first, to repay all debt of the lenders under the Senior Facilities
and certain hedging obligations. Consequently, you may not be able to recover on such Shared Collateral because
the lenders under the Senior Facilities will have a prior claim on all proceeds realized from any enforcement of
such collateral.

In addition, under the Intercreditor Agreement, the right of the holders of the Notes to enforce their security
over the Shared Collateral is limited. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
Agreement—Restrictions Relating to Midco Notes—Restrictions on Enforcement by Midco Finance Party.”

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Some, but not all, of the Issuer’s subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. As of and for the year ended
December 31, 2013, the Guarantors (excluding BidCo) accounted for 64% of the consolidated gross assets
(excluding goodwill and certain other intangible assets resulting from the purchase price allocation of our
acquisition by Triton in 2010 which cannot be allocated to individual subsidiaries), 50% of the consolidated net
sales and 60% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Group (in each case, excluding BidCo). Unless a subsidiary is
a Guarantor, the Issuer’s subsidiaries will not have any obligations to pay amounts due under the Notes or to
make funds available for that purpose. Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, nonguarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their
claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer or
any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or
dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

    - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to
proceed against the assets of such non-guarantor subsidiary; and

    - creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to
payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer or any
Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such
subsidiary.

In addition, the Indenture governing the Notes will, subject to some limitations, permit these subsidiaries to
incur additional indebtedness and will not contain any limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such as trade
payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries.

48


-----

As such, the Notes, each Guarantee the Proceeds Loan and each other intercompany proceeds loan will be
structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our nonGuarantor subsidiaries.

**_The loans under our Senior Facilities Agreement will bear interest at floating rates that could rise_**
**_significantly, increasing our interest cost and reducing our cash flow._**

The loans under our Senior Facilities Agreement will bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum
equal to LIBOR and/or EURIBOR (as applicable), as adjusted periodically, plus a spread. These interest rates
could rise significantly in the future. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements
designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on
commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a
significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to
rise significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

The manner of calculating EURIBOR and LIBOR has recently been reviewed by European regulators and
others. There can be no assurance that EURIBOR and LIBOR will continue to be calculated as they have been
historically, or at all.

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The Notes will be secured by the Shared Collateral which will also secure the obligations under our Senior
Facilities, and certain hedging liabilities. In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted to
incur significant additional pari passu indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same
Collateral.

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that a common security agent, who will serve as the Shared
Security Agent for the secured parties with respect to the Shared Collateral, will act only as provided for in the
Intercreditor Agreement. The Shared Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Collateral unless otherwise
instructed by the Instructing Group. For the purposes of enforcement, “Instructing Group” means, in the
context of our capital structure upon consumation of the Transactions, more than 66 [2]/3% by value of the total
senior credit participations under the Senior Facilities and certain hedge counter-parties at that time (the
“Majority Senior Secured Creditors”). The Majority Senior Secured Creditors have interests that are different
from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect
to pursue their remedies under the security documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders
of the Notes to do so. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and
“Description of the Notes—Security.”

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees._**

The Collateral and the Guarantees securing the Notes will be subject to any and all restrictions under
applicable law and exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under the
Indenture and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of security interests in the Collateral securing the
Notes from time to time, whether on or after the date the Notes are issued. The existence of any such restrictions,
exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the
Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agents to realize or foreclose on such
Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among
others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of
certain jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Agents will be subject to practical problems generally associated with
the realization of security interests in collateral. The Security Agents may also need to obtain the consent of a
third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agents will be able to obtain any
such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to
facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agents may not have the ability to foreclose
upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

49


-----

In addition, our business requires a variety of permits and licenses. The continued operation of the
Guarantor’s properties that depend on the maintenance of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or
restricted. Our business is subject to regulations and permitting requirements and may be adversely affected if we
are unable to comply with existing regulations or requirements or if changes in applicable regulations or
requirements occur. In the event of foreclosure, the grant of permits and licenses may be revoked, the transfer of
such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require us to incur significant cost and expense. Further, we
cannot assure you that the applicable governmental authorities will consent to the transfer of all such permits. If
the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not obtained, are delayed or are economically prevented,
the foreclosure may be delayed, a temporary or lasting shutdown of operations may result, and the value of the
Guarantees may be significantly decreased.

**_You may not be able to recover any amounts under the Notes or the Guarantees due to the intercreditor_**
**_payment waterfall._**

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds from enforcement of the Shared Collateral will
be applied first to repay amounts due under the Senior Facilities (or any replacement facilities) and certain
hedging obligations. Any remaining amounts will then be applied, pari passu and pro rata, to amounts due under
the Notes and any pari passu additional indebtedness. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
Intercreditor Agreement.” If you (or the Trustee on your behalf) receive any proceeds from enforcement of the
Shared Collateral prior to the satisfaction with the Notes and the Guarantees, you (or the Trustee on your behalf)
will be required to turn over such proceeds until claims under such other indebtedness are satisfied and until
ratable claims are equally satisfied. Hence, you may recover less from the proceeds of an enforcement action
than you otherwise would have. As a result of these and other provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement, you may
not be able to recover any amounts under the Notes or the Guarantees in the event of a default on the Notes.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes in full under which the Collateral_**
**_securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of_**
**_the Security Agents._**

Under various circumstances, Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically, including:

    - in connection with any sale or other disposition of such property or assets constituting Collateral, if the
sale or other disposition does not violate the “Asset Sale” provisions of the Indenture;

    - in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the
release of the property and assets, and share capital, of such Guarantor;

    - if the Issuer designates any restricted subsidiary to be an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets of such subsidiary;

    - upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided
under “Description of the Notes—Defeasance” and “Description of the Notes—Satisfaction and
Discharge;”

    - in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, or as otherwise provided for under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

    - in accordance with the “Amendment, supplement and waiver” provisions of the Indenture, as described
in “Description of the Notes—Amendments and Waivers.”

In addition, under various circumstances, the Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released automatically,
including:

    - in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that Guarantor
(including by way of merger or consolidation) to a person that is not (either before or after giving effect
to such transaction) the Issuer or a restricted subsidiary of the issuer, if the sale or other disposition
does not violate the “Asset Sale” provisions of the Indenture;

50


-----

    - in connection with any sale or other disposition of the capital stock of that Guarantor to a person that is
not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or a restricted subsidiary of the
Issuer, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the “Asset Sale” provisions of the Indenture and
the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) as a result
of the sale or other disposition;

    - if the Issuer designates any restricted subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an unrestricted subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

    - upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided
under “Description of the Notes—Defeasance” and “Description of the Notes—Satisfaction and
Discharge;”

    - in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or as otherwise provided for under the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

    - in accordance with the “Amendment and waivers” provisions of the Indenture; or

    - in the case of any restricted subsidiary that after the Issue Date is required to guarantee the Notes
pursuant to the covenant described under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation
on Indebtedness” upon the release or discharge of the guarantee of indebtedness by such restricted
subsidiary which resulted in the obligation to guarantee the Notes; provided that such restricted
subsidiary does not guarantee any other indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor.

In addition, the liens created by the security documents will be released (a) in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant
described under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.” Furthermore,
under German law a secured party is, upon request by the relevant security grantor, obligated to release security
if the realizable value of the security is significantly higher than the value of the obligations secured by such
security.

**_Each Guarantee and the security interests in the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on_**
**_enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and_**
**_enforceability._**

The Guarantees and the Collateral may be subject to claims or could be limited or subordinated in favor of
the relevant Guarantor’s or relevant security grantor’s existing and future creditors under applicable laws. In
addition, enforcement of each Guarantee will be limited to the extent of the amount which can be guaranteed by a
particular Guarantor without rendering the Guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under, or contrary to,
applicable law and enforcement of each security interest in the Collateral will be limited to the extent of the
amount which can be secured by a particular grantor of Collateral without rendering the security interest voidable
or otherwise ineffective under, or contrary to, applicable law. For example, the Guarantees by our Italian
subsidiaries, Wittur Italia Holding s.r.l. and Wittur S.p.A., are expected to be limited to €5.0 million and €1.0
million, respectively (based on a Completion Date of March 31, 2015). The limitation of the Italian Guarantees
will be calculated as a percentage of the intercompany proceeds loans used to refinance existing indebtedness of
our Italian subsidiaries and could be higher or lower, depending on the amount of outstanding local debt on the
actual Completion Date. In addition, the Guarantee provided by Wittur Asanso¨r San. V Tic. A.S., our subsidiary
in Turkey, will be capped at €2.5 million due to local considerations. However, we cannot provide any
assurances that holders of the Notes will be able to recover even these amounts under such Guarantees, as
payment under each Guarantee is contractually subordinated to all the senior indebtedness of such Guarantor,
including such Guarantor’s obligations under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations.

Enforcement of any of the Guarantees or the Collateral against any Guarantor and any grantor of Collateral
will also be subject to certain defenses available to guarantors and grantors of security interests generally. These
defenses include, primarily with respect to subsidiary Guarantors and subsidiary grantors of Collateral, those that
relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, insolvency, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate
purpose or benefit, preservation of share capital, capital maintenance, the statutory and fiduciary duties of the
directors and officers of any Guarantor, thin capitalization and defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and similar laws,
a court could subordinate or void any guarantee or security interest provided by such Guarantor or security
grantor if it found that:

    - the Guarantee was incurred or the security interest granted with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud
creditors or shareholders of the respective guarantor or security grantor;

51


-----

    - the relevant Guarantor or security grantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent
value for the Guarantee or the security interest granted, and the relevant Guarantor or security grantor:
(i) was insolvent or was rendered insolvent because of the Guarantee or security interest granted;
(ii) was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the Guarantee or security interest
granted; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debt beyond its ability to pay at
maturity;

    - the Guarantee or security interest granted was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant
Guarantor or security grantor or was not in the best interests or for the benefit of the relevant guarantor
or security grantor; or

    - the amount payable or secured under the relevant Guarantee or the Collateral was in excess of the
maximum amount permitted under applicable law.

The measure of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance and similar laws varies depending on the
law applied. Generally, however, a Guarantor or security grantor would be considered insolvent if it could not
pay its debts as they became due. In such circumstances, if a court voided such Guarantee or Collateral, or held it
unenforceable, holders of the Notes and the Security Agents, as applicable, would cease to have any claim in
respect of the relevant Guarantor or the relevant Collateral, would be creditors solely of the Issuer and any
remaining Guarantors and would benefit only from any remaining Collateral. The holders of the Notes and the
Security Agents may also be required to repay any amounts received with respect to such Guarantee or such
Collateral.

The grant of Collateral or Guarantees may also be voidable by the grantor or Guarantor or by an insolvency
trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may be otherwise set aside by a court, if
certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor or Guarantor is deemed to
be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured parties to receive a greater recovery than
if the grant had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor or Guarantor is
commenced within a legally specified “clawback” period following the grant.

Further, the Guarantees and the Collateral may be subject to claims that they should be limited or
subordinated under German, United States or other applicable law. The enforcement of the Guarantees and the
Collateral will be limited to the extent that the granting of such Guarantees and the Collateral is not in the
corporate interest of the relevant Guarantor or provider of security, would be in breach of capital maintenance or
thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws or that the burden of such Guarantee or Collateral
securing the Notes and the Guarantees exceed the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or provider of security. In
particular, for the subsidiary Guarantors and providers of Collateral organized under German law, each of their
respective Guarantee or Collateral will be contractually limited to the extent the granting of such Guarantee or
enforcement of such Collateral would result in a breach of capital maintenance rules or other statutory laws or
would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or provider of Collateral to contravene their duties to
incur civil or criminal liability or to contravene any legal prohibition.

Accordingly, enforcement of any Guarantee and Collateral would be subject to certain defenses available to
the grantors thereof generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the Indenture and/or the documents
governing the Guarantees and the Collateral designed to ensure compliance with applicable legal requirements.
As a result, the Issuer’s, the Guarantors’ and the security grantors’ liability under the Guarantees and the
Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law applicable to it. In the event that
any Guarantee or Collateral is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation
of the Guarantee or security obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the
relevant Guarantor or security grantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes, or any Guarantee
or Collateral is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot
assure you that we can ever repay in full, at at all, any amounts outstanding under the Notes. For further
information, see “Certain Limitations on the Validity and the Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security
Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”

**_The Notes may be considered shareholder debt under German law, and may be subordinated to other debt of_**
**_the Issuer._**

Loans or similar debt extended to the Issuer or to a German Guarantor by a direct or indirect shareholder of
such debtor are generally subordinated under German insolvency laws, if such shareholder holds equity interests
in such debtor in excess of 10% of the total share capital. However, under certain circumstances, such debt may
also be subordinated despite the shareholder holding 10% or less of such debtor’s share capital.

German law does not expressly exclude debt securities, such as the Notes, from the scope of equitable
subordination and thus any holder of Notes who simultaneously (directly or indirectly) holds an equity interest of

52


-----

more than 10% in the Issuer or a Guarantor could be subject to equitable subordination under German insolvency
laws. In addition, there is a risk that even third party creditors, if such creditors are affiliated with the debtor or its
shareholders or could otherwise be regarded as “shareholder-like,” are treated like shareholders in that loans or
other debt they granted to the debtor would be equitably subordinated under German insolvency laws. German
law does not specify a test to determine whether any creditor is shareholder-like and thus the holders of the Notes
may be considered shareholder-like and their claims under the Notes and the Guarantees may be equitably
subordinated in an insolvency of the Issuer or a German Guarantor.

If a shareholder or person with a shareholder-like position transfers its shareholding and/or loan or similar
lending (including the Notes) to a third party, such loan or similar lending could remain equitably subordinated
for at least one year following such transfer. In the event that payment (principal or interest) on such a
shareholder loan or similar lending has been made during the year prior to the petition for insolvency
proceedings (or thereafter), such payment may be appealed and reversed under statutory avoidance provisions.
Also, any transaction that involved the granting of collateral to secure a loan or similar lending during the period
of 10 years prior to the petition (or thereafter) may be set aside. See “Certain Limitations on the Validity and the
Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agents rather than directly to the holders_**
**_of the Notes, and the ability of the Security Agents to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by_**
**_local law._**

The security interests that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the obligations of the
Guarantors under the Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but to the respective
Security Agent, and thus the holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have
recourse to, any of the security documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the security
documents except through the relevant Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting
a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the
Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See “Description of Certain
Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

In addition, the ability of the Security Agents to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory
provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For example,
the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale
through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of
certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as
registered holders in a security document will be validly secured.

In certain jurisdictions, including Germany, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation
and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement
will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the relevant Security Agent (“Parallel
**Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors towards holders of the Notes under or in**
connection with the Indenture (“Principal Obligations”). All or part of the pledges and other security interests in
such jurisdictions will be granted to the relevant Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will
not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel
Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any
payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment
in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security
interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and
will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the relevant
Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the relevant
Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these
jurisdictions and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt construct
are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes
will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral. See “Certain
Limitations on the Validity and the Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain
Insolvency Law Considerations.”

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_**
**_Collateral._**

Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected and its
priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The liens in the Collateral securing the

53


-----

Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if the Issuer is not able to take the actions
necessary to perfect any of these liens on or prior to the Issue Date. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agents
for the Notes has any obligation to monitor the creation or perfection of any security interest or to take any steps
or action to perfect any of the security interests in the Collateral. Such failure may result in such security interest
not being created in such property or rights or the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against
third parties being adversely affected.

**_The Issuer and the other security providers will have control over the Collateral, and the sale of particular_**
**_assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The security documents allow the Issuer and the other security interest providers to remain in possession of,
retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral
securing the Notes. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the
Issuer and the other security interest providers may, among other things, without any release or consent by the
Trustee or the Security Agents, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral and make
ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_The granting of the Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the_**
**_incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such_**
**_security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of Guarantees and security interests to secure the Notes and the Guarantees may create
hardening or voidance periods for such Guarantees and security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of
shared security interests to secure future permitted debt may restart or reopen such hardening or voidance periods
in particular, as the Indenture for the Notes permits the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the
Notes in certain circumstances including in connection with the incurrence of future debt. The applicable
hardening or voidance period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest
has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced
before the end of the respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared
void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. Please see “Certain Limitations on the Validity and
the Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the accession of further
subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interests over their relevant assets and equity
interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. Please see “Description of the Notes—Security.”

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the United States, and
our business is conducted entirely outside the United States. The directors and executive officers of the Issuer
and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to
the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be
unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuer
and the Guarantors. In addition, as all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective
subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may
be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the
U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions
of the federal securities laws of the United States.

The United States are not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with Germany. For further
information see “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of Notes under the Notes or the Guarantees or the security across multiple_**
**_jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, which is incorporated under the laws of Germany, and will be
guaranteed by entities organized under the laws of Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the
United Kingdom. Assets which constitute the Collateral, and the entities whose capital stock constitutes the
Collateral, are located in Germany and, in the event of insolvency, application to commence insolvency

54


-----

proceedings or similar events, proceedings could be initiated in Germany. The rights of the holders of the Notes
with respect to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral are likely to be subject to the insolvency and
administrative laws of several jurisdictions, and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively
enforce your rights in such complex multi-jurisdictional proceedings. In addition, such multi-jurisdictional
proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in
the enforcement of creditors’ rights. Further, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administration and other laws of the
jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer and the Guarantors and security grantors may be materially different
from, or in conflict with, one another, including creditors’ rights, priority of creditors and the duration of the
insolvency proceeding. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over
which jurisdiction’s laws should apply and could adversely affect the ability to enforce the security and to realize
any recovery under the Notes and the Guarantees. See also “Certain Limitations on the Validity and the
Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”

**_Local insolvency laws may not be as favorable to you as insolvency laws of jurisdictions with which you may_**
**_be familiar and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes._**

Both the Issuer and the providers of the Collateral are organized under the laws of Germany. The
Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the
United Kingdom. Future subsidiaries of the Issuer may be incorporated in other jurisdictions and may be subject
to the insolvency laws of various jurisdictions. Consequently, in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of the
Issuer or any of the Guarantors or providers of collateral, insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer, the
Guarantors or providers of collateral would most likely be based on and governed by the insolvency laws of the
jurisdiction under which the relevant entity has its registered office, to the extent that the center of the main
interests (the “COMI”) of each company provided for under the Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 on
insolvency proceedings (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”) (where applicable) is not located elsewhere. The
insolvency laws of Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom and the other
jurisdictions under which the Issuer, Guarantors and grantors of collateral are established may be less favorable
to your interests as creditors than the bankruptcy laws of the United States of America or another jurisdiction
with which you may be familiar, in particular with respect to priority of creditors, ability to obtain post-petition
interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings. The application of these laws, and any conflict between
them, may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising
under other insolvency laws. See also “Certain Limitations on the Validity and the Enforceability of the
Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” for additional information on
the insolvency laws of the European Union as well as Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the
United Kingdom.

**_We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control, and the occurrence of certain_**
**_important corporate events may not constitute a change of control._**

If a change of control (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, we will be required to make an offer to purchase
all the outstanding Notes at a premium, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. In such a
situation, we may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under any such offer. In
addition, our Senior Facilities Agreement may prohibit us from purchasing the Notes upon a change of control
without first repaying the Senior Facilities in full. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, we will
likely have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes; however, we may not be able to obtain such
financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control may also result in a mandatory prepayment under our
Senior Facilities and agreements governing any future indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of such
indebtedness.

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the
event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers or other similar
transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in
voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a change of control as defined in the
Indenture.

**_There are significant restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell your Notes._**

The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under United States and
applicable state securities laws. The Notes have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any state
securities laws, and we do not intend to register the Notes under the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities

55


-----

laws after the offering. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the Notes in the United States only in a transaction
exempt from the registration requirements of the United States and applicable state securities laws, and you may
be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. The risk may be exacerbated by
the absence of registration rights for the holders of the Notes.

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Irish Stock Exchange._**

Although the Issuer will, in the Indenture, agree to use its reasonable best efforts to have the Notes listed on
the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on its Global Exchange Market within a
reasonable period after the Issue Date and to maintain such listing as long as the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer
cannot assure you that the Notes will become, or remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the
Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and the admission to trading on the Global Exchange Market or it
becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such
listing on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange, provided that it will use reasonable best efforts to obtain
and maintain the listing of the Notes on another stock exchange although there can be no assurance that the Issuer
will be able to do so. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the
Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers in
accordance with the Indenture, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes from the Official
List of the Irish Stock Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with the Indenture, may have a
material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell l Notes in the secondary market.

**_Your ability to transfer the Notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and there is no_**
**_assurance that any active trading market will develop for the Notes._**

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there is currently no market. We do not intend to have the
Notes listed on a national securities exchange (as defined in U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934) or to arrange
for quotation on any automated dealer quotation systems. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend
to make a market in the Notes, as permitted by applicable laws and regulations; however, the Initial Purchasers
are not obligated to make a market in the Notes and they may discontinue their market making activities at any
time without notice. Therefore, we cannot assure you as to the development or liquidity of any trading market for
the Notes. The liquidity of any market for the Notes will depend on a number of factors, including, but not
limited to:

    - the number of holders of Notes;

    - our operating performance and financial condition;

    - the market for similar securities;

    - the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the Notes; and

    - prevailing interest rates.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. We cannot assure you that the market, if any,
for the Notes will be free from similar disruptions or that any such disruptions may not adversely affect the prices
at which you may sell your Notes. Therefore, we cannot assure you that you will be able to sell your Notes at a
particular time or price, if at all.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not
reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein and
other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No
assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating
will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the
future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by
one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings
and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

56


-----

**_Certain covenants will be suspended if we receive investment grade ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes receive an
investment grade rating (BBB- or better by Fitch, Baa3 or better by Moody’s and BBB- or better by S&P) and no
default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time
as the Notes are no longer rated investment grade by either ratings agency, certain covenants will cease to be
applicable to the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on
Achievement of Investment Grade Status.”

At any time when these covenants are suspended, we will be able to, among other things, incur additional
indebtedness, pay cash dividends and redeem subordinated indebtedness without restriction, each of which may
conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an
investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

**_The Notes will be held in book-entry form and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant_**
**_clearing system to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will be issued in registered global form. The Regulation S Global Note and the Rule 144A Global
Note will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary.

Ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to
persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such
participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. Owners of beneficial
interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive definitive Notes in registered form, except under the
limited circumstances described in “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form—Definitive Registered Notes.” So long as
the Notes are held in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders”
of the Notes. The nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream will be considered the sole
holder of the Global Notes. Accordingly, if you hold a Book-Entry Interest, you must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and on the procedures of the participant through which you hold your
interest to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Notes under the Indenture governing the Notes.

Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest and
additional amounts, if any) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agents. The Paying Agents will, in turn,
make such payments to the common depositary (or its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream. The common
depositary or its nominee will in turn distribute such payments to participants in accordance with its procedures.
After payment to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream, we will have no
responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the holders of Book-Entry
Interests.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the direct right to
act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes.
Instead, if you hold a Book-Entry Interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received
appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable. The procedures implemented for the
granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable you to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture governing the Notes, unless and
until definitive registered Notes are issued in respect of all Book-Entry Interests, if you hold a Book-Entry
Interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear or Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented
through Euroclear or Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

**_You may face currency exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes are denominated and payable in euro. If you measure your investment returns by reference to a
currency other than euro, investment in such Notes entails currency exchange related risks due to, among other
factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency you use to measure your
investment returns, caused by economic, political and other factors which affect exchange rates and over which
we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which you measure your
investment returns would cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and
could result in a loss to you when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which

57


-----

you measure your investment returns. There may be tax consequences for you as a result of any currency
exchange gains or losses resulting from your investment in the Notes. You should consult your tax advisor
concerning the tax consequences to you of acquiring, holding and disposing of the Notes.

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

If the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price (as determined for U.S. federal income
tax purposes) by an amount greater than or equal to a statutorily defined de minimis amount, then the Notes will
be considered to be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the
Notes are issued with OID, in addition to the stated interest on the Notes, a U.S. holder (as defined in
“Taxation—Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations”) will be required to include such OID in
gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues on a constant yield to maturity basis for U.S. federal income tax
purposes in advance of the receipt of cash payments to which such income is attributable and regardless of the
U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Taxation—Certain United States
Federal Income Tax Considerations—Original Issue Discount.”

**_The interests of our shareholders may conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

Bain Capital indirectly owns the majority of the shares of the indirect parent entity of the Issuer. As a result,
our shareholders have and will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the power to affect our legal and capital
structure as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve other changes to our
operations and to control the outcome of matters requiring action by our shareholders. Our shareholders’ interests
in certain circumstances may conflict with your interests as noteholders, particularly if we encounter financial
difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. For example, the shareholders could vote to cause us to
incur additional indebtedness. Our shareholders are in the business of making investments in companies and may
acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Our shareholders may also
pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition
opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, our shareholders have held, hold or may hold interests in
suppliers or customers of the Wittur Group. Our shareholders and their affiliates could also have an interest in
pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their
equity investments, although such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of Notes.

**_We do not present stand-alone financial information for each of our subsidiaries that Guarantee the Notes_**
**_and Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the Issuer included in this offering memorandum may be_**
**_of limited use in assessing the financial position of the Guarantor subsidiaries._**

As of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, the Guarantors accounted for 64% of the consolidated
gross assets (excluding goodwill and certain other intangible assets resulting from the purchase price allocation
of our acquisition by Triton in 2010 which cannot be allocated to individual subsidiaries), 50% of the
consolidated net sales and 60% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Group. Under such circumstances, the rules
of the Irish Stock Exchange require us to include stand-alone financial information for each Guarantor in the
listing particulars to be filed with the Irish Stock Exchange. We have applied for an exemption from this
requirement with the Irish Stock Exchange, currently expect that such application will be granted and thus do not
currently intend to present stand-alone financial information for our Guarantor subsidiaries.

Included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum are only the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial
Statements, 2013 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and 2012 Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements all of which are consolidated at the level of the Target and do not include standalone financial
information for any subsidiary Guarantor. As the non-Guarantor subsidiaries represent in excess of 25% of our
consolidated EBITDA and gross assets as of and in the year ended December 31, 2013, such consolidated
financial statements may be of limited use in assessing the financial position of the Guarantors.

**_There may be differences between our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, subject to_**
**_whether prepared in accordance with German GAAP, IFRS or U.S. GAAP._**

Our Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and 2013 Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, but
our 2012 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis of German GAAP. German
GAAP differs in certain respects from IFRS. Both IFRS and German GAAP differ in certain material respects
from U.S. GAAP. As a result, the results of operations and financial condition derived from the financial
statements that are included in this Offering Memorandum may differ substantially from the results of operations

and financial condition derived from financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Issuer
has not prepared a reconciliation of its financial information to U.S. GAAP, or of its 2012 Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements to IFRS, nor has the Issuer prepared a summary of significant accounting differences in the
accounting and valuation methods of IFRS, German GAAP and U.S. GAAP, nor has the Issuer otherwise
reviewed the impact the application of U.S. GAAP would have on its financial reporting. Because there are
differences between German GAAP, IFRS and U.S. GAAP, if we had prepared our 2012 Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements on the basis of IFRS instead of German GAAP, or all our financial statements in
accordance with U.S. GAAP instead of other accounting standards, there could be substantial differences in our
results of operations, cash flows and financial position, including levels of indebtedness. Accordingly, in making
an investment decision, investors must rely on their own examination of our financial information.

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

**The Acquisition**

On December 22, 2014, BidCo, an entity indirectly owned by Bain Capital and the direct, wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Issuer, entered into the Acquisition Agreement with TriWay HoldCo AB, Way Equity GmbH &
Co KG and Way Shareholder Loan I GmbH & Co KG to acquire all the issued and outstanding capital stock of
the Target and certain shareholder loans (the “Acquisition”). The consummation of the Acquisition is subject to
satisfaction of certain conditions, including regulatory approval in Germany, Austria, Finland, Brazil and China.
In addition, the Transaction will be subject to certain statutory conditions, such as regulatory approval in Turkey.
If regulatory approval is not obtained on or prior to, or if any injunction by a governmental authority of
competent jurisdiction that restrains or prohibits the consummation of the Acquisition is in effect as of
September 30, 2015 (or such later date as the parties to the Acquisition Agreement agree), the Acquisition
Agreement may be terminated by the Target. As part of the Acquisition, Bain Capital intends to establish a
management equity plan under which our senior management may hold ordinary shares of LuxCo. See “Certain
Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Management Equity Plan.”

The Issuer, a Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung incorporated and existing under the laws of Germany,
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HoldCo, a Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung incorporated and existing
under the laws of Germany. HoldCo, in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TopCo, a Gesellschaft mit
_beschränkter Haftung incorporated and existing under the laws of Germany. TopCo, in turn, is a wholly owned_
subsidiary of LuxCo, a Société à responsabilité limitée incorporated and existing under the laws of Luxembourg.
Each of TopCo, HoldCo, the Issuer and BidCo were acquired by Bain Capital as acquisition vehicles for the
Transactions. LuxCo was formed by Bain Capital as an acquisition vehicle for the Transactions.

**The Financing**

The Acquisition is expected to require €593.3 million of debt and equity financing, excluding transaction
fees and expenses, but including the repayment of the net debt of the Target and its subsidiaries. The Acquisition
will be financed in part through the issuance of the Notes in an aggregate principal amount of €200.0 million and
a drawing of the New Term Loan B Facility in an amount of €220.0 million.

As of the Completion Date, the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of €65.0 million
will also be available. Currently, it is expected that the Revolving Credit Facility will not be drawn as of the
Completion Date. See “Use of Proceeds.”

The proceeds from the financing described above will be used to:

    - fund the consideration payable for the capital stock of the Target purchased in the Acquisition;

    - repay all existing amounts outstanding under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement;

    - repay debt of certain subsidiaries of the Target; and

    - pay the fees and expenses in connection with the Acquisition and the Financing, including estimated
fees and expenses to be incurred in connection with the Offering.

Pending the consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds from
the Offering of the Notes into the Escrow Account in the name of the Issuer. The Escrow Account will be
controlled by, and pledged on a first-ranking basis in favor of, the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes.
The release of escrow proceeds is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the consummation of
the Acquisition. If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to September 30, 2015, the Notes will be
subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price will be a price equal to
100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any,
from the Issue Date to the date of special mandatory redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of
Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

We refer to the Acquisition and the Financing collectively as the “Transactions.” See “Use of Proceeds,”
“Capitalization,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements,” and “Description of the Notes.”

60


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the gross proceeds from the Offering will be equivalent to €200.0 million. Pending the
consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds from the Offering into
the Escrow Account for the benefit of the holders of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Escrow of
Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” On or prior to the Completion Date, HoldCo will make the Equity
Contribution in order to pay part of the consideration payable for all the capital stock of the Target.

The Issuer intends to use the proceeds from the Offering, together with the proceeds from the Equity
Contribution and a drawing of the New Term Loan B Facility, to (i) fund the consideration payable for the capital
stock of the Target and the Target’s outstanding obligations under certain shareholder loans, (ii) repay all
amounts outstanding under the Existing Senior Facilities and other debt of certain subsidiaries of the Target and
(iii) pay the estimated fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, including commitment,
placement, financial advisory and other transaction costs and professional fees. See “The Transactions.”

In connection with the Transactions, the Issuer will enter into the Senior Facilities Agreement, which will
also provide for a Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of €65.0 million to finance the ongoing working
capital needs of the Group. The Revolving Credit Facility is not currently expected to be drawn as of the
Completion Date.

The expected estimated sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the Transactions (including
the Acquisition) are shown in the table below. Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on
several factors, including differences from our estimates of transaction costs and the actual Completion Date, and
cash flow generated by the Target until the Completion Date. Any changes in these amounts may affect the
amount of the Equity Contribution or the amount of cash on the balance sheet of the Target used to finance the
Acquisition. For example, if the cash on the balance sheet of the Target as of the Completion Date is lower than
expected, the Issuer will have to fund a higher amount for the repayment of the Existing Senior Facilities. Such
additional funds would be provided by increasing the Equity Contribution.

(1) Equity consists of the equity contribution made by HoldCo to the Issuer. See “Principal Shareholders—Preferred Equity Certificates of
LuxCo, Shareholder Loan to TopCo and Deferred Consideration” for a description of the equity financing of HoldCo, TopCo and
LuxCo.
(2) Includes amounts contributed to the equity of BidCo and the Proceeds Loan, and constitutes the Purchase Price for the Acquisition. The
Purchase Price for the Acquisition includes the share purchase price, repayment of the Target’s existing shareholder loan and interest
accrued thereon (assuming a March 31, 2015 Completion Date) and certain other estimated charges under the Acquisition Agreement.
(3) Represents the aggregate outstanding principal amount plus all accrued and unpaid interest as well as any late fees, prepayment fees and
all other charges owed under each of the Existing Senior Facilities, and certain other indebtedness of the Target and its subsidiaries
(assuming a March 31, 2015 Completion Date), less cash and cash equivalents of the Target of an estimated €43.7 million to be used in
connection with the repayment thereof. To the extent more or less cash is available for use on the balance sheet of the Target on the
Acquisition Closing Date, and subject to the lockbox mechanisms set forth in the Acquisition Agreement, the amount of equity used to
finance the Acquisition may decrease or increase, subject to certain limitations on minimum equity specified in the Acquisition
Agreement. In addition, as of September 30, 2014, we had €5.6 million of indebtedness outstanding under local lines of credit that we
assume will be repaid in connection with the Transactions. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Local Credit Lines.”
However, we may eventually choose not to repay some or all of these local lines of credit in connection with the Transaction. If we do
not to repay these local lines of credit, the amount of our equity investment or the amount of cash on the balance sheet of the Target used
to finance the Acquisition would decrease by the amount of such local lines not repaid.
(4) Estimated fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including commitment, placement, financial advisory, accrued interest for
escrow and other transaction costs and professional fees. Other expenses may be payable by the Target.

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth our consolidated cash and cash equivalents and the consolidated capitalization
as of September 30, 2014, on a historical basis, and as adjusted to give effect to the completion of the Offering
and the application of the proceeds therefrom as described in “Use of Proceeds” as if they had occurred on
September 30, 2014. The historical consolidated financial information has been derived from the Unaudited
Interim Consolidated Financial Statements of the Target prepared on the basis of IFRS included elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum.

This table should be read in conjunction with “Use of Proceeds,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and the
Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum. Except as set forth below, there have been no other material changes to our capitalization since
September 30, 2014.

(1) As adjusted cash and cash equivalents reflects the use of cash as set forth in “Use of Proceeds,” without giving effect to any increase or
decrease of cash from operations since September 30, 2014, but assuming that sufficient cash from operations was generated as
contemplated under “Use of Proceeds.”
(2) Includes current and non-current portions of liabilities outstanding under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement.
(3) As of the Completion Date, we expect the €65.0 million Revolving Credit Facility under the Senior Facility to remain undrawn.
(4) Local lines of credit consist of certain local working capital and exports subsidy lines of credit for our subsidiaries in Argentina, Austria,
India and Turkey, that we assume will be repaid in connection with the Transactions. As of September 30, 2014, we had approximately
€5.6 million (equivalent) outstanding and an additional €5.4 million (equivalent) available under these local lines of credit. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Local Credit Lines.” However, we may eventually choose not to repay some or all of
these local lines of credit. If we do not repay these local lines of credit, the amount of our equity investment or the amount of cash on the
balance sheet of the Target used to finance the Acquisition would decrease by the amount of such local lines not repaid, and our
indebtedness on an as adjusted basis would increase by a corresponding amount. If we repay these local lines of credit, we expect to be
able to redraw them in the future.
(5) Includes current and non-current portions of liabilities in respect of finance leases.
(6) The aggregate principal amount of the Notes is stated gross of any capitalized issue costs.
(7) The value shown in the historical column consists of certain shareholder loans granted to the Target by the Sellers which will be repaid in
connection with the Transactions and the Sellers’ equity in the Wittur Group. The value shown in the as adjusted column consists of the
Equity Contribution.

Financial Statements which were prepared on the basis of German GAAP. Please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Differences between German GAAP and IFRS.”
(**) The difference of €10.1 million in sales under German GAAP and revenue under IFRS for the year ended December 31, 2012, reflects
the sale of the operations of Wittur Hydraulic Drives s.r.l., Bagnatica, Italy, in 2013, which was classified as discontinued operations for
purposes of the 2013 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and therefore was excluded from the presentation of revenues under
IFRS, but not from the presentation of sales under German GAAP. For additional details, please see note 5.9 to the 2013 Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Overview**

We are the world’s leading independent elevator components manufacturer. The elevator components
industry is characterized by long-term growth and resilience during economic downturns due to a number of
favorable factors. Demand for elevators has grown significantly faster than GDP due to a number of favorable
global trends, such as population growth, urbanization, taller buildings, aging populations, increased wealth and
increased regulation and safety awareness. As a manufacturer of elevator components operating independently
from elevator installers, we also benefit from the trend of elevator installers increasingly seeking to outsource the
manufacture of components, which has increased the rate of growth for elevator components manufacturers
above the growth in demand for elevators. Our position as the leading independent elevator components
manufacturer has enabled us to capitalize on these growth trends, as evidenced by our strong long-term revenue
growth and EBITDA margins in excess of 10% on average since 2004.

We are a global manufacturer of elevator components with a strong footprint across multiple regions. We
divide our operations into three geographical regions which include Europe, Asia and the Rest of the World. Our
Europe region includes our operations in Africa and represents our core market, accounting for 48.6% of our
revenue in the year ended December 31, 2013, with upside potential as Southern European economies recover.
Our Asia region provides the growth engine for our business, with 37.4% of our revenue, driven by increased
urbanization and other favorable trends in China, and with the potential to grow spare parts sales in China as the
market matures. Our Rest of the World region primarily includes Eurasia, Turkey, the Middle East and Latin
America and represented 13.9% of our revenue, with the potential for significant future growth.

Our product offering features a large range of elevator components for new elevator manufacturing and
sourcing, for spare parts and for modernization and upgrades. Our components span from sophisticated
mechatronic components for elevator cabin and landing doors (including the associated opening mechanisms) to
other critical components such as gearless drives, slings, safety gears and cars. We also offer complete elevators,
which we primarily sell to independent elevator installers (“Independents”). Sales of doors and door
components accounted for 69% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2013. Doors and door
components are required at each floor of a building, so as the average height of new buildings increases, the
demand for elevator doors and door components also increases at a faster rate than demand for other components.
Doors and door components range from relatively standardized, high-volume production doors to highly
customized, special-order doors—we offer 19 models of landing doors and 15 models of elevator car doors.
Having produced approximately 1.2 million doors and door components in the year ended December 31, 2013,
we believe we are the leading elevator door and door components supplier in a highly fragmented elevator
components market.

We manufacture components for both the original equipment market and the aftermarket. We estimate that
the original equipment market makes up a larger percentage of our business in developing countries, such as

69


-----

China, while the aftermarket makes up approximately 50% of our sales in a mature market such as Europe.
Aftermarket sales range from routine provision of spare parts through the lifetime of an elevator, to components
for modernization and upgrade of an elevator, to complete replacement of an elevator. In developing markets
such as China, we expect aftermarket components sales to strongly increase as the life cycle of newly-installed
elevators progresses.

Our key customers are global, multinational corporation elevator installers (“MNCs”), such as westernbased MNCs Kone, Otis, Schindler and ThyssenKrupp Elevator (“Western MNCs”) and Asian-based MNCs
Fujitec, Hitachi, Hyundai, Mitsubishi Electric and Toshiba (“Asian MNCs”), as well as Independents, which are
typically active in a limited geographic market. In the year ended December 31, 2013, Western MNCs accounted
for approximately 68% of our revenue, Independents for approximately 32% of our revenue and Asian MNCs for
less than 1% of our revenue. We have deeply-ingrained, mutually-dependent relationships with a number of our
key customers, and benefit from multi-year, guaranteed “share-of-wallet” contracts with a number of our key
customers, allowing us to share in the growth of our customers’ business.

In the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we generated revenue of €501.4 million and Historic
Adjusted EBITDA of €72.7 million. As of September 30, 2014, we had a work force of 3,206 employees and
conducted business in more than 50 countries.

**Trends**

A number of global trends affect the dynamics of the elevator components industry, including population
growth and urbanization, increasing wealth levels, increased safety regulation and environmental awareness, and
increased outsourcing.

**_Population growth, urbanization and increasing wealth levels as drivers for new installations_**

We expect new installations of elevators, particularly in urban areas, to continue to be the main driver of the
elevator components market. Demand for new installations of elevators is primarily influenced by continued
population growth, as well as an increase in the global urbanization rate. Urban populations surpassed rural
populations in 2010 for the first time in history. While overall population growth in emerging markets
significantly outpaces population growth in Europe and North America, we believe that the pace at which
urbanization takes place in key emerging markets, such as China and India, is not substantially higher than the
urbanization rates of more developed countries. We believe this suggests that the growth of the urban population
in these emerging markets will continue in the future. For example, a Global consulting firm has established that
China’s urban population will increase from 50% in 2011 to 70% in 2030. Growing population and increasing
urbanization have historically led to an increase in construction activity, which historically, has also benefited the
elevator components industry.

Rising levels of wealth and GDP per capita also drive demand for elevators. We believe that urban
residential floor space per capita is closely correlated to urban GDP per capita, and a gap still exists between
developed economies in Europe (such as Italy with urban residential space of 45 square meters per capita) and
emerging market economies, such as China (with urban residential space of 24-26 square meters per capita). As
GDP per capita increases in emerging markets, demand for increased floor space per capita also increases,
leading to a further increase in construction activity in urban areas. This increased demand for floor space per
capita as well as the increasing density of urban regions, particularly in Asia, is expected to lead to taller
buildings, which, in turn, is expected to lead to an increase in demand for new elevator installations in excess of
construction activity.

**_Increasing safety regulation, energy efficiency and environmental awareness as drivers for modernization and_**
**_maintenance_**

Increased regulation and changing safety norms, as well as consciousness for energy efficiency and
environmental protection, have historically supported elevator modernization and maintenance, and we expect
these trends will continue to drive demand for elevator components to modernize and support the existing global
installed elevator base. For example, we expect the implementation of EU Directive EN 81-20/50, which will
overhaul the existing regulatory regime in Europe and introduce heightened safety requirements for elevators, to
lead to an increase in demand for modernization to comply with the new regulations.

70


-----

We also expect demand for elevator maintenance to continue to be supported by an existing, mature
installed elevator base in Europe, as well as maturing installed elevator bases in China and India in the near
future. See also “—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Demand for elevator
modernization and maintenance.”

Rising energy costs, environmental awareness, as well as regulatory requirements to reduce the carbon
footprint of new and modernized construction projects, are expected to increase the demand for energy efficient
elevators equipped with, for example, gearless drive ranges (which also reduce backlash, vibration and noise) and
high suspension loads. Continuation of these trends would further drive modernization of the installed elevator
base.

**_Increased outsourcing_**

The outsourcing of the production of elevator components by global MNCs and Independents to suppliers is
an ongoing trend which has historically driven demand for elevator parts. We expect this trend to continue in the
future. A number of factors drives outsourcing by elevator producers, including (i) the ability of the elevator
producer to focus on core activities, such as the elevator installation and maintenance business without having to
attend to potential production issues; (ii) increased flexibility of the elevator producer in terms of production
capacity and locations, as well as increased speed of penetration of new markets; (iii) the ability to free up cash
by avoiding capital expenditures for new production facilities; (iv) lack of economies of scale and in-house
production capacities of a large number of elevator producers; and (v) the ability of MNCs to access innovation
capabilities and best-in-class processes through outsourcing.

Generally, Western MNCs have outsourced a high portion of their components, a trend that we expect to
continue as a result of increasing standardization of platforms. Outsourcing allows Western MNCs to reduce the
complexity and cost of their own product offering. In contrast, Asian MNCs have historically been more
reluctant to outsource production on a large scale; however, we expect Asian MNCs to outsource business in
target growth markets outside their traditional home markets (such growth markets including India, South East
Asia and, potentially, China) in the future to, for example, preserve cash for footprint expansion, and maintain
flexibility in terms of production capacity and location. Independents have historically outsourced the largest
portion of component modules due to their lack of scale and in-house production capabilities, and we expect
leading Independents to continue to require support from suppliers, such as us that are able to provide them with
tailored solutions and comply with increasingly stringent local regulations.

**Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition**

Factors affecting our results of operations and financial condition include the following:

**_Global economic conditions and economic and political conditions in certain regions_**

We offer our customers a large range of elevator components for elevator installation and servicing. We also
offer complete elevators. Customer demand for elevator components is primarily driven by new elevator
installations, both in newly constructed buildings and existing structures, as well as the need for modernization
and maintenance of the installed base. These factors are affected by general global economic conditions and the
economic and political conditions in the regions in which we operate our business.

Demand for new elevator installations in any geographic market, particularly for new construction, is
largely driven by the activity in the construction industry in that market. The construction industry is generally
cyclical in nature, and its performance has historically demonstrated a strong correlation with GDP growth and
unemployment levels. It is also sensitive to factors such as demographics, inflation, interest rates and the cost of
financing, including mortgage financing, as well as other macroeconomic factors. Political instability or changes
in fiscal or other government policies may also affect the construction industry. In addition, the construction
industry is also subject to customer preferences that are specific to each of the countries in which we operate.

Elevator modernization and maintenance have historically been less cyclical in nature than the construction
industry in general, and the level of cyclicality is primarily driven by the size and age of the installed base of a
particular region, as well as by regulation and energy efficiency requirements in such region. Nevertheless, as
large-scale, non-essential maintenance projects may require significant levels of capital investments, and as our
business depends on our customers’ willingness to commit funds to these projects, prolonged periods of
economic uncertainty or political instability may lead to a decline in modernization and maintenance activity and
adversely affect our revenue.

71


-----

**_Demand for elevator modernization and maintenance_**

We sell elevator components for use in both new elevator installations and for modernizations, upgrades and
maintenance spare parts. The share of our business constituting modernizations, upgrades and maintenance spare
parts compared to new elevator installations varies by region, depending on the age of the installed base of
elevators and the pace of new installation. For example, we estimate that modernization, upgrades and
maintenance spare parts constitute approximately 50% of our sales in a mature market such as Europe, but
currently represent only 10% of our sales in emerging markets, such as China. Elevator modernization and
maintenance is also driven by increased safety regulation as well as increased energy efficiency standards.

While the installed elevator base in Europe is relatively old, with approximately 60% of installed elevators
older than 10 years, and thus unlikely to further age on an average basis, only 10% of installed elevators in China
and 20% of installed elevators in India are older than 10 years. As a result, a Global consulting firm expects a
significant ageing of installed elevator bases in China and India in the near future to lead to a strong increase in
modernization activity in these countries. We believe this factor will provide for increased visibility and
resilience in the sales of elevator components.

Furthermore, in 2014, the European Union adopted EU Directive EN 81 20/50, which represents a major
overhaul of the currently applicable safety regulations for elevators and which introduces, among other things,
higher standards for door pressure testing, a new door pendulum shock test and new rules for door retaining
devices. Historically, non-European Union countries have adopted European regulations, and a number of key
emerging markets, such as China, are expected to adopt EU EN 81 20/50 in the near future. We expect that this
regulatory overhaul will drive elevator modernization as MNCs and other manufacturers of elevators will be
required to comply with EU EN 81 20/15 from 2017.

Elevator modernization and maintenance is also driven by an increasing regulatory focus on energy
efficiency and environmental protection. For example, EU Directive 2002/91/EC on Energy Performance of
Buildings aims to decrease energy consumption in buildings by 20% by 2020 and directs European Union
member states to introduce energy efficiency targets for newly constructed and renovated buildings. Kone
estimates that elevators currently account for approximately 8% of total energy consumption in single and multidwelling units and in non-industrial properties. Modernized elevators recover the energy that is released when the
elevator is used, allowing for energy savings of 20%-35%.

We believe that we are well-positioned to capture future modernization and maintenance opportunities
resulting from these factors, particularly in China and India where we are one of few companies with longstanding modernization and maintenance experience as a result of our operations in Europe.

**_Steel prices and our ability to pass on cost increases to our customers_**

Direct material costs (the accounting term used in our accounts to represent raw material costs) constitute a
large portion of our production costs, and fluctuations in the price of our raw materials affect our results of
operations. In the year ended December 31, 2013, direct material costs accounted for €240.1 million, or 67.1% of
our cost of sales. The primary raw materials used in our production processes are metal sheets and coils, carbon
steel and stainless steel, but we also purchase other steel products such as steel rolled profiles. Steel products are
our most important raw material and we estimate that steel products accounted for approximately one-third of our
raw material costs in the year ended December 31, 2013. As a result, the market price of steel impacts our results
of operations. Other raw materials used in our business include aluminium and titanium, and exhibit similar
market dynamics as those exhibited by the market for steel.

Generally, the price for steel correlates to general economic conditions. For example, steel prices peaked in
2008, subsequently declined as a result of the global economic downturn in 2009 and 2010, and increased sharply
in the wake of economic recovery in 2011. Future spikes in the price for steel or other raw materials could
significantly increase our cost of sales.

We currently do not hedge against fluctuations in steel prices, but our management has adopted new policies
in 2012 pursuant to which we manage these costs. We estimate that approximately 60% by value of the steel
contained in our products is sold based on current spot prices. For these purchases, the steel price component is
assessed individually for each order, and increases in market prices for steel can be passed through to our
customers without significant lead time. The remaining approximately 40% by value of steel content in our
product is sold pursuant to contracts with two of our key MNC customers which provide for pass-through

72


-----

mechanisms and reflect the fact that these customers themselves purchase large quantities of steel. One passthrough mechanism, which applies to the majority of our steel content sold to these two customers, fixes the steel
price we can charge at the relevant customer’s average steel purchasing price during the preceding six months.
This fixed price remains binding for six months, after which it is reset pursuant to the same mechanism. As a
result, any increases in the average steel price are passed through to these two MNCs with a six month delay. The
other pass-through mechanism, which we carry out in Europe with one of our MNC customers, provides for a
certain percentage representing an assumed fixed percentage of the steel make-up of our products and allows us
to pass-through 90% of any price increases during a six month review period.

However, steel prices might rise in the period between when we negotiate the price for a project and the
time we purchase steel for that project. In addition, since approximately 40% by value of our steel content is sold
pursuant to the pass-through mechanisms described above, we are exposed to changes in steel prices for up to six
months until the fixed steel price we charge our customers can be readjusted. The positive effects of such
readjustments may not occur in the periods in which the additional expenses have been incurred, but only in later
periods. In that event, the price increases will not have a compensating effect for the periods in which the costs
increased. We try to manage these risks by anticipating both our steel requirements and movements in the market
price for steel in advance. Under some of our contracts, our customers have undertaken to share their order intake
and production forecasts with us and have guaranteed us a minimum “share-of-wallet” with them. We believe
this improves our visibility on future steel requirements in the short and medium term and thus the accuracy of
our forecasts.

While we believe we have generally been able to pass through increased raw material prices to our
customers in the past three years, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so. This could affect
our results of operations for the period in which we are unable to pass through price increases. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We are exposed to fluctuations in prices of raw materials.”

**_Expansion of operational footprint_**

We operate a significant part of our business in the mature markets of Europe, which accounted for 48.6%
of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2013. Sales in mature markets are typically driven by demand for
modernization and maintenance of the installed elevator base, as well as spare parts, which in turn are influenced
by changes in the regulatory framework, safety requirements and the focus on energy efficient and
environmentally friendly products. We also operate a significant part of our business in emerging markets
(particularly, China, India, Eurasia and Latin America) and our Asia and Rest of the World regions accounted for
37.4% and 13.9% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013, respectively. Sales in emerging markets
have historically been driven by strong demand for new installations of elevators, particularly in China, which
accounted for approximately 55% of global new elevator installations in 2014, and India, which accounted for
approximately 5% of all new elevator installations in 2013.

We have expanded our global footprint, in particular in emerging markets, significantly over the three years
ended December 31, 2013 and such expansion has affected our results of operations, including our capital
expenditures and cost base. We have been early entrants into a number of emerging markets with local
production, such as Turkey (1993), China (1995), Argentina and Brazil (both 2000), Slovakia (2009) and India
(2010). The expansion of our operational footprint and the development of business in a new market affects our
results of operations in a number of ways. First, the period during which we enter a new market is usually
characterized by increased capital expenditures necessary to establish an operational footprint in that market.
Second, while our operations in a new market are still in the start-up phase, these operations usually contribute
negative EBITDA to our consolidated results, mainly as a result of a lack in generated revenue to offset costs,
such as costs related to marketing, establishing a sales force or general legal and administrative expenses.
However, once we have solidified our operations in an emerging market and fully established a local presence
and local workforce, our operations usually benefit from a lower cost base compared to our more mature
markets. For example, we are currently evaluating the relocation of some of our Austrian production capabilities
to our facilities in India to take advantage of the lower cost base and proximity to growth markets for our
business.

**_Operational improvement measures and supply chain optimization_**

Our results of operations are affected by operational improvement measures that we undertake, and between
2010 and 2013 we successfully developed, implemented and executed various restructuring and improvement
measures to reduce fixed costs and increase operational efficiency. The focus of these measures was mainly on

73


-----

the transfer of production to lower cost locations and headcount reductions in the manufacturing area. For
example, as part of these measures, we closed our plant in Madrid, Spain and moved our production capacity and
business operations to our plant in Zaragoza, Spain. Additionally, we sold our plant in Bergamo, Italy, which
resulted in a strategic headcount reduction of 62 full-time equivalent employees during 2013. Furthermore, our
shift of production facilities and capabilities to lower-cost countries has reduced our labor costs. In connection
with these restructuring and operational improvement measures, we incurred expenses of €3.0 million and
€8.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In contrast, we estimate that we
realized synergies and cost savings of €9.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of these
measures.

To optimize our supply chain and further increase overall product quality and safety, we appointed a global
supply chain manager in 2012 who is responsible for implementing and monitoring our global purchasing and
logistics strategy as well as supplier quality development. Additionally, in 2012, we created a centralized global
procurement platform and consolidated our supplier base, focusing on larger, global suppliers and reducing the
number of local suppliers. As a result, we have been able to realize substantial procurement cost savings and
increase the transparency of our cost structure, and we estimate that our supply chain optimization measures
reduced our cost base by 3.6% in the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the year ended December 31,
2012. Furthermore, as we increased the overall monitoring of our suppliers, we believe we have also been able to
further improve the overall quality and safety of our products.

**_Innovation and investments_**

In order to support our leading positions in our markets and maintain our technological advantage, we are
required to continually develop new products and improve existing products. Our R&D activities primarily focus
on optimizing the quality and complementary nature of our existing product portfolio maintaining compliance
with our industry’s strict regulatory and safety requirements and ensuring continued acceptance of our products
by our customers. Although the pace of innovation in the elevator components industry is generally slower than it
is in other high-tech industries, we also focus a significant portion of our R&D capabilities on developing new
products and materials and adding innovative functions and applications to our existing product range. As of
December 31, 2013, we employed more than 220 FTEs in research, development and engineering capacities at
seven R&D centers throughout the world. In the year ended December 31, 2013, we incurred research and
development costs (including capitalized portions) of €7.6 million, or 1.6% of revenues, compared to
€6.8 million, or 1.5% of revenues, in the year ended December 31, 2012.

To expand our business operations in new markets, such as China, and to acquire property plant and
equipment, we incurred capital expenditures of €12.9 million, or 2.7% of revenue, and €9.7 million, or 2.1% of
revenue, in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In both 2013 and 2012, capital
expenditures mainly reflect the expansion of our operations in China. We expect to incur capital expenditures of
€11.5 million in the year ending December 31, 2015. See also “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital
Expenditures.”

**_Foreign currency exchange rates_**

Our reported results of operation and financial condition are affected by exchange rate fluctuation and we
are exposed to both transactional and translational risk due to these fluctuations.

Transactional risk arises when our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than their functional
currency. We currently operate production facilities in ten countries, and sell our products into approximately
100 countries. As a result, we generate a significant portion of our sales and incur a significant portion of our
expenses in currencies other than euro, our reporting currency. The primary currencies in which we generated
revenues in twelve months ended September 30, 2014 were the euro, the Chinese renminbi and the U.S. dollar,
and we expect the portion of our sales and costs denominated in renminbi to increase as we continue to expand
our Chinese operations. Where we are unable to match sales received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the
same currency, our results of operations are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. For example, a
stronger euro will increase the cost of euro-denominated supplies for our non-euro businesses and conversely
decrease the cost of non-euro supplies for our euro businesses. A 5% increase/(decrease) of the euro against the
Chinese renminbi or the Turkish lira in 2013 would have increased/(decreased) our earnings before tax for the
year ended December 31, 2013 by €95,000/€(95,000) and €583,000/€(583,000), respectively. Our subsidiaries
generally execute their sales and incur most of their materials costs in the same currency.

We present our consolidated financial statements in euro. As a result, we must translate the assets, liabilities,
revenue and expenses of all of our operations with a functional currency other than euro into euro at thenapplicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of these currencies against the euro
may affect the value of our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses with respect to our non-euro businesses in our
consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency, which creates
translation risk. These translations could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial
periods and result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity.
We record the effects of these translations in our income statement as other income or other expenses.

**_Customer concentration_**

Our business depends on, and is strongly aligned with the businesses of, our four largest customers. We
generate approximately two-thirds of our revenues, with one of these four customers accounting for a significant
proportion of those revenues and another one of these four customers also representing a significant and growing
portion of our revenues. We are a trusted supplier to our largest customers, who include Kone, Schindler, Otis
and ThyssenKrupp Elevator. Our long-standing relationships with each of these customers have allowed us to
better understand these customers’ needs and priorities, thereby enabling us to cater to their requirements, from
conception, design and development to manufacturing and distribution of components to offering comprehensive
after-sale services and technical support. We also grow our business in line with our largest MNC customers and
expand our operations into geographies into which they expand to better serve them. Our success has historically
mirrored those of our largest customers.

Our industry is marked by a relatively small number of large customers, and we expect this high
concentration of customers to continue for the foreseeable future. The high level of customer concentration in our
industry entails a high degree of dependence on our key customers. If we were to lose any of our key customers,
we may be unable to find an alternative customer of similar size, or otherwise compensate for such loss, in a
timely manner, or at all. Additionally, our business has historically benefited from the growth of our customers’
businesses, and for this reason we depend on the performance of our customers’ business and their ability to
continue growing their business and outsourcing to us. In light of the maturity of the European elevator
components market, our ability to win contracts with new customers in the European market is impacted by
whether we succeed in taking market share from our competitors in Europe. Additionally, customers in our
industry face time and cost-related barriers to selecting new suppliers for their elevators, as changing suppliers
requires new homologation of such components and the review and adjustment of all maintenance manuals.
However, these cost-related barriers also partly insulate us against the risk of losing any of our key customers, as
any of our customers would incur significant switching costs if it decided to terminate our business relationship
and source its components from one of our competitors. In addition, we have long-standing relationships with
each of these key customers, which we have maintained over the past 15 to 30 years. These long-standing
relationships have allowed us to better understand our customers’ needs and priorities, thereby enabling us to
cater to our customers from conception, design and development to manufacturing and distribution of
components to offering comprehensive after-sale services and technical support. Another factor mitigating the
risk of losing any of our MNCs as customers is that MNCs put substantial efforts into long-term product
standardization in order to simplify and reduce complexity in the maintenance and breakdown service process.
For these reasons, elevator installers prefer to remain with selected components and suppliers. Doing so reduces
failure rates and maintenance cost, improves productivity and minimizes safety risks. For a description of our
contracts with our four key customers see “Our Business—Material Agreements with Customers.”

**Our geographic regions**

We divide our operations into three regions, which include Europe, Asia and the Rest of the World. These
regions describe the geographic region in which we manufacture our products, but do not necessarily correspond
to their end-market.

(*) Revenue by region for the year ended December 31, 2011 has been derived from the 2012 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements,
which were prepared on the basis of German GAAP, but have been regrouped to match our current revenue split and therefore deviate
from our 2012 Audited Financial Statements in which revenues by region do not include sales deductions and were grouped differently.
Other periods presented were prepared on the basis of IFRS.

**_Europe_**

Our Europe region represents our core market and comprises our European operations, including operations
in Germany, Austria, Spain, Italy and Greece, as well as our operations in Africa. Additionally, our Europe
region includes our headquarters and certain holding company costs. In the year ended December 31, 2013, we
generated revenue of €233.4 million, or 48.6% of our revenues in our Europe region.

Historically, revenue growth in our Europe region has been supported by a mature installed base, which
drives modernization and maintenance, as well as demand for innovative elevator components designed to
further increase elevator safety and energy efficiency. We have also expanded our operations in Africa in recent
years through direct sales (primarily from Spain) and a new trading unit.

In the year ended December 31, 2013, we generated 62% of our revenue in our Europe region through sales
to our MNC customers and the remainder through sales to Independents. In the year ended December 31, 2013,
sales of elevator doors and door components accounted for 51% of our revenue, followed by slings, drives and
electronics, which accounted for 14%, 6% and 6%, respectively.

Generally speaking, our operations in our Europe region benefit from high margins, primarily due to high
gross profit margins, which are partially offset by a higher cost base as a result of, for example, high marketing
costs.

**_Asia_**

Our Asia region has been the growth engine for our business and primarily comprises our operations in
China, India, and Korea. In the year ended December 31, 2013, we generated revenue of €179.5 million, or
37.4% of our revenues, in our Asia region. This constituted an increase of €19.6 million, or 12.3%, compared to
2012. China accounted for 93% of our Asia revenue in the year ended December 31, 2013 and 93% of our Asia
revenue in the year 2012.

Revenue growth in our Asia region is primarily the result of new elevator installations, which are driven by
increased population growth, urbanization and increasing demand for higher square footage per capita, especially
in China. Additionally, our business has benefited from our close cooperation with market-leading Western
MNCs and their expansion in Asia, particularly in China.

In the year ended December 31, 2013, we generated 92% of our revenue in our Asia region through sales to
our MNC customers. We generated the remainder of our Asia revenue through sales to Independents. In the year
ended December 31, 2013, sales of elevator doors and door components accounted for 93% of our revenue for
Asia, followed by slings, drives and electronics.

Generally speaking, our operations in the Asia region are characterized by margins roughly comparable to
our operations in our Europe region.

**_Rest of the World_**

Our Rest of the World region mainly comprises our operations in Latin America (particularly, Brazil) and
Eurasia and accounted for €66.9 million, or 13.9%, of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2013.

76


-----

Revenue growth in our Rest of the World region is both the result of new elevator installations, particularly
in Latin America, which accounted for 8% of estimated global elevator market value in 2013, and demand for
modernization and maintenance, particularly in Russia, which is driven by an ageing installed base.

In the year ended December 31, 2013, we generated 21% of our revenue in our Rest of the World region
through sales to our MNC customers. We generated the remaining 79% of our Rest of the World revenue through
sales to Independents. In the year ended December 31, 2013, sales of elevator doors and door components
accounted for 22% of our revenue, followed by slings, drives and electronics.

Generally speaking, our operations in the Rest of the World region are characterized by margins roughly
comparable to our operations in our Europe region and Asia region.

**Explanation of Key Line Items**

The following section provides a description of our key IFRS financial statement line items:

**_Revenues_**

Revenue is primarily generated from the manufacture and provision of components, drives and systems for
the elevator industry. This includes elevator components, such as automatic elevator doors, cabins, safety
components, drives, elevator frames and complete elevators, used both in new installations and modernizations.
These components are integrated into elevator systems for public elevators, cargo elevators and also in shipping.

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade
discounts and volume rebates. Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have
been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return
of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and the
amount of revenue can be measured reliably.

**_Cost of sales_**

Cost of sales includes direct and indirect production costs attributable to the production process and relating
to the products sold, including costs of materials, labor, freight, packaging and other costs. We exclude from cost
of sales personnel costs for employees in research and development, selling and distribution and general and
administration functions and instead record these costs in research and development costs, selling expenses and
general administration costs, respectively. Cost of sales also includes income and costs resulting from changes in
warranty provisions.

**_Selling expenses_**

Selling expenses primarily consists of salaries, wages and incidental costs for sales and marketing
personnel, costs related to trade fairs, travel expenses related to our sales and marketing operations and other
marketing costs.

**_Research and development expenses_**

Research and development expenses primarily consists of personnel-related costs and other costs directly
linked to research and development throughout our business. We capitalize research and development costs
related to product or process enhancements if the completion of the product or process is technically and
economically feasible, the developed product or process is marketable, the expenditures can be measured
reliably, and if we have adequate resources available to complete the development of the project or process. We
recognize all other costs related to product or process development as an expense. We report capitalized
development expenditures for completed projects at cost less cumulative amortization and impairment losses. We
test capitalized development costs for intangible assets not yet available for use for impairment once a year.

**_Administrative expenses_**

Administrative expenses consists of compensation and associated expenses for administrative functions
such as finance, legal, information technology, human resource and general management costs, audit fees, bank
fees, tax and legal consultancy costs and costs of bad debt allowances and bad debt write offs, as well as
depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets.

77


-----

**_Other income_**

Other income primarily includes gains related to foreign currency transactions, rental income from leased
property, grants and government subsidies received.

**_Other expenses_**

Other expenses primarily includes losses related to foreign currency transactions, and non-corporate taxes
expensed.

**_Finance income_**

Finance income includes interest income on receivables, cash investments and marketable securities, gains
on fair value adjustments of financial instruments and other interest income.

**_Finance expenses_**

Finance expenses includes interest expenses on loans and borrowings, amortization of capitalized
transaction costs, interest cost from discounting of defined benefit obligations, losses on fair value adjustments of
financial instruments and other interest expenses.

**_Income taxes_**

Income tax expense includes current and deferred corporate income taxes and withholding taxes on dividend
payments.

**_Discontinued operations_**

Discontinued operations related to the sale of Wittur Hydraulic Drives based in Bagnatica, Italy, in 2013 and
includes losses for the year and loss on disposal of the subsidiary including all related disposal costs.

**_Results of Operations_**

The following table provides an overview of our results of operations for the years ended December 31,
2012 and 2013, as well as the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2014 as reported pursuant to IFRS.

_Revenues_

Our revenues increased by €21.6 million, or 6.0%, from €359.3 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2013, to €380.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This increase was
primarily due to a stable revenue generation in Europe, double-digit growth in Asia and new installations and
modernization projects by international customers and MNCs in the Rest of World region.

_Europe_

Revenue in our Europe region decreased by €0.3 million, or 0.1%, to €175.4 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2014, from €175.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. This slight
decrease in revenue was primarily the result of stable demand for elevator components and spare parts for
modernization and maintenance projects of the installed elevator base (including a 4% increase in MNC sales by
our Austria business in the nine months ended September 30, 2014) in an overall difficult macroeconomic
environment, especially in the markets in Spain, Italy and Greece. In the nine months ended September 30, 2014,
sales to MNCs accounted for 61.4%, of our revenue for Europe, an increase of 0.5 percentage points from 2013,
and sales to Independents contributed 38.6%, compared to 39.1% in 2013.

79


-----

_Asia_

Revenue in our Asia region increased by €19.0 million, or 13.9%, to €154.6 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2014, from €135.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. This increase in
revenue was primarily the result of an increase in new elevator installations, which outpaced overall GDP growth
and the growth in the construction industry, particularly in China. In the nine months ended September 30, 2014,
sales to MNCs accounted for 92.7% of our revenue for Asia, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points from 2013, and
sales to Independents contributed 7.3%, compared to 7.1% in 2013.

_Rest of World_

Revenue in our Rest of the World region increased by €3.0 million, or 6.2%, to €50.8 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2014, from €47.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. This
increase in revenue was primarily the result of an increase in revenue from key emerging markets in this region,
including Brazil, driven by new installations and modernization projects by both Independents and MNCs. In the
nine months ended September 30, 2014, sales to MNCs accounted for 22.8% of our revenue, an increase of
1.7 percentage points from 2013, and sales to Independents contributed 77.2%, compared to 78.9% in 2013.

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales increased by €11.2 million, or 4.1%, from €268.9 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2013 to €280.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This increase in cost of
sales was primarily due to sales growth, primarily in Asia, and was partially offset by purchasing savings, effects
of our operational improvement measures and reduced cost of warranty claims. Cost of direct materials amounted
to €189.9 million, or 67.8%, of our overall cost of sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, an
increase of €8.4 million, or 4.6%, compared to 2013. This increase in direct material costs, consumables and
merchandise was primarily the result of increased sales volumes. Prices for our key raw materials, steel,
aluminium and titanium remained relatively stable. Other cost of sales, including certain labor costs and costs for
freight and packaging, increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period
in 2013, primarily due to sales growth. Our purchasing activities realized cost saving as a result of our supply
chain optimization. Our operational improvement measures included the closure of our Madrid plant and the
transfer of its operations to our Zaragoza plant, the transfer of productions from higher cost countries to lower
cost countries, and strategic headcount reductions.

_Gross Profit_

Gross profit increased by €10.4 million, or 11.5%, from €90.4 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2013, to €100.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This increase in gross
profit was primarily due to the sales growth, offset by our purchasing savings, effects of our operational
improvement measures and reduced cost of warranty claims.

_Selling Expenses_

Selling expenses decreased by €1.0 million, or 6.8%, from €14.8 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2013, to €13.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This decrease in selling
expenses was primarily due to expenses related to the biennial Interlift fairs that occurred in the nine months
ended September 30, 2013, but not in the nine months ended September 30, 2014.

_Research & Development Expenses_

Research & Development expenses increased by €0.3 million, or 7.3%, from €4.4 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2013, to €4.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This increase in
research and development expenses was primarily due to increased R&D activities in 2014 as compared to 2013,
which was linked to the R&D function becoming more strategically aligned with the business after its
reorganization in 2013, and which resulted in an increase of our R&D employee base by eleven full-time
employees. Since these eleven employees were neither hired at the beginning of the period, nor all at the same
time, the increase in Research & Development expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 is not
reflective of the impact on our Research & Development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014. As a
result, the increase in research and development expenses in 2014 mainly reflects salaries, wages and related
expenses.

-----

_Administrative Expenses_

Administrative expenses decreased by €1.1 million, or 2.6%, from €42.4 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2013, to €41.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This decrease in
administrative expenses was primarily due to the reduced depreciation of purchase price allocation assets,
partially offset by increased labor costs as a result of an increase in the number of our full-time equivalent
employees in 2014, allowances for bad debt relating to trade and increased IT consultancy costs.

_Other Income_

Other income decreased by €0.6 million, or 30.2%, from €1.9 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2013, to €1.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This decrease in other income
was primarily due to decrease in exchange gains on foreign currency transactions as a result of a weaker euro in
2014 compared to 2013.

_Other Expenses_

Other expenses increased by €0.4 million, or 25.5%, from €1.4 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2013, to €1.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This increase in other
expenses was primarily due to an increase in other taxes which related to education tax and city construction tax
in China.

_Finance Expense_

Finance expense decreased by €3.1 million, or 19.0%, from €16.1 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2013 to €13.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This decrease in finance
expense was primarily due to a decrease in shareholder loan interest expense as a result of our loan repayment in
the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2013.

_Finance Income_

Finance income increased by €0.8 million, or 257.5%, from €0.3 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2013, to €1.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This increase was primarily
due to the fair value adjustment on our foreign exchange hedges in 2014.

_Income Taxes_

Income taxes increased by €3.6 million, or 46.0%, from €7.9 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2013, to €11.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This increase was primarily
due to increased taxable income as a result of the factors described above.

_Loss after Taxes for Discontinued Operations_

In the nine months ended September 30, 2013 there was a loss after taxes for discontinued operations of
€0.6 million which resulted from the sale of Wittur Hydraulic Drives, based in Bagnatica, Italy, during that year.
There are no such results relevant for the nine months ended September 30, 2014.

_Revenues_

Revenues increased by €23.8 million, or 5.2%, from €455.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012,
to €479.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase in revenues was primarily driven by
increased sales to our Western MNC customers Kone, Otis and Schindler in China and Turkey, mainly as a result
of new installations.

(1) Revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 has been derived from our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and is
audited financial information. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, revenues by region include sales deductions and thus
deviate from our 2013 Audited Financial Statements in which revenues by region for these years do not include sales deductions.

_Europe_

Revenue in our Europe region decreased slightly by €0.6 million, or 0.3%, to €233.4 million in the year
ended December 31, 2013, from €234.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This slight decrease in
revenue was primarily the result of stable demand for elevator components and spare parts for modernization and
maintenance projects of the installed elevator base in an overall difficult macroeconomic environment, especially
in our markets in Italy, Spain and Greece. In year ended December 31, 2013, sales to MNCs accounted for 61.8%
of our revenue for Europe, an increase of 3.8 percentage points from 2012, and sales to Independents contributed
38.2%, compared to 42.0% in 2012.

82


-----

_Asia_

Revenue in our Asia region increased by €19.7 million, or 12.3%, to €179.5 million in the year ended
December 31, 2013, from €159.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase in revenue was
primarily the result of an increase in new elevator installations which outpaced overall GDP growth and the
growth in the construction industry, particularly in China. In the year ended December 31, 2013, sales to MNCs
accounted for 92.3% of our revenue in Asia, and Independents contributed 7.7%.

_Rest of World_

Revenue in our Rest of the World region increased by €4.8 million, or 7.8%, to €66.9 million in the year
ended December 31, 2013, from €62.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase in revenue
was primarily the result of an increase in revenue from key emerging markets in this region, including Brazil,
driven by new installations and modernization projects by both Independents and MNCs. In the year ended
December 31, 2013, sales to MNCs accounted for 21.5% of our revenue in our Rest of the World region, an
increase of 2.1 percentage points from 2012, and sales to Independents contributed 78.5% compared to 76.4% in
2012.

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales increased by €21.2 million, or 6.3%, to €357.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2013
from €336.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2012.

This increase in cost of sales was primarily due to new plant start-up costs in China, the reallocation of costs
for order management and logistics functions from selling expenses to cost of sales and the reallocation of
packaging costs from selling expenses to cost of sales based on improved functionality of the accounting systems
in 2013. Cost of sales also increased as a result of sales growth, primarily in Asia, which was partially offset by
purchasing savings as a result of the optimization of our supply chain. Cost of direct materials amounted to
€240.1 million, or 67%, of our overall cost of sales in the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of
€6.1 million, or 3%, compared to 2012. This increase in direct material costs, consumables and merchandise was
primarily the result of increased sales volumes, partially offset by a decrease in the prices for our key raw
materials, steel, aluminium and titanium. Other cost of sales, including certain labor costs and costs for
packaging, increased during the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily
due to sales growth, while costs for freight decreased.

_Gross Profit_

Gross profit increased by €2.7 million, or 2.3%, to €121.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2013,
from €119.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase in gross profit was primarily due to
sales growth, as well as due to reduced costs resulting from our operational improvement measures, realization of
additional cost savings related to our purchasing activities as a result of our supply chain optimization and lower
cost relating to warranty claims.

_Selling Expenses_

Selling expenses decreased by €2.5 million, or 11.4%, to €19.7 million in the year ended December 31,
2013, from €22.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease was primarily due to a reallocation
of costs for order management and logistics functions from selling expenses to cost of sales and the reallocation
of packaging costs from selling expenses to cost of sales based on improved functionality of the accounting
systems in 2013.

_Research & Development Expenses_

Research & Development expenses remained relatively constant at €5.8 million in the year ended
December 31, 2013, compared to €5.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. Research and development
expenses in the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily related to product development and testing.

83


-----

_Administrative Expenses_

Administrative expenses decreased by €5.1 million, or 8.0%, to €59.3 million in the year ended
December 31, 2013, from €64.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease in administrative
expenses was primarily due to reduced costs for restructuring and one-off improvement projects.

_Other Income_

Other income increased by €0.3 million, or 12.2%, to €2.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013,
from €2.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to significant gains on
foreign currency exchange in 2013, partially offset by a reduction in tax credits received in Argentina in 2013
compared to 2012.

_Other Expenses_

Other expenses decreased by €0.9 million, or 32.9%, to €1.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2013,
from €2.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease was primarily due to foreign currency
exchange losses in 2012 compared to foreign currency gains in 2013, as well as a reduction in taxes related to the
charging of some taxes directly to the cost of sales.

_Finance Expense_

Finance expense remained relatively constant at €21.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2013,
compared to €21.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. Finance expenses in 2013 consisted of
shareholder loan interest expense of €11.5 million, interest on borrowings of €7.2 million and amortization of
transaction costs of €1.6 million related to the financing put in place in connection with our Existing Senior
Facilities.

_Finance Income_

Finance income increased by €0.4 million, or 79.1%, to €0.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013,
from €0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to the fair value
adjustment for interest derivatives.

_Income Taxes_

Income taxes increased by €4.2 million, or 81.7%, to €9.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013,
from €5.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to reduced deferred tax
credits relating to purchase price allocation depreciation and taxes incurred on our Hong Kong acquisition in
2013. Our effective tax rate decreased in the year ended December 31, 2013, due to the capitalization of deferred
tax assets on loss carry-forwards in 2013.

_Loss after Taxes for Discontinued Operations_

Loss after taxes for discontinued operations increased by €0.2 million, or 45.6%, to €0.6 million in the year
ended December 31, 2013, from €0.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily
due to the sale of Wittur Hydraulic Drives in Italy during 2013.

_Net Result for the Period_

Net result for the period increased by €7.6 million to a profit of €7.6 million in the year ended December 31,
2013 from a loss of €0.03 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily as a result
of the factors described above.

_Sales_

Sales increased by €78.3 million, or 20.2%, to €466.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, from
€387.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to growth in the new
installation market in Europe.

(1) Revenue for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012 has been derived from our 2012 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements,
which were prepared on the basis of German GAAP and have been regrouped to match our current revenue split. For the year ended
December 31, 2012, revenues by region include sales deductions and thus deviate from our 2013 Audited Financial Statements in which
revenues by region for this year do not include sales deductions and had been grouped differently.

_Europe_

Revenue in our Europe region increased by €19.3 million, or 8.6%, from €224.8 million in the year ended
December 31, 2011, to €244.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily the
result of increased sales to MNCs in Austria and increased sales to Independents in Sweden for elevator
maintenance and modernization components, which were partially offset by lower sales to Independents in Spain
due to market conditions.

85


-----

_Asia_

Revenue in our Asia region increased by €53.0 million, or 49.6%, from €106.8 million in year ended
December 31, 2011, to €159.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was as a result of
substantial growth in sales to MNCs in Asia (primarily in China) in respect of new elevator installations. In the
year ended December 31, 2012, sales to MNCs accounted for 92.3% of our revenue in Asia, and Independents
contributed 7.7% of our revenue in the region.

_Rest of World_

Revenue in our Rest of the World region increased by €6.0 million, or 10.7%, to €62.1 million in year ended
December 31, 2012, from €56.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase in revenue was
primarily the result of an increase in revenue from emerging markets in this region, including in particular
Argentina and Brazil, and was driven by new installations and modernisation projects carried out by both
Independents and MNCs. In the year ended December 31, 2012, sales to MNCs accounted for 23.6% of our
revenue in our Rest of the world region, compared to 22.5% in 2011, and sales to Independents contributed
76.4% compared to 77.5% in 2011.

_Decrease in finished goods and work in progress_

Finished goods and work in progress charge decreased by €2.9 million in the year ended December 31,
2012, compared to a decrease of €3.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease in 2012 was
primarily due to one-off depreciation of purchase price allocation on the fair value uplift on inventory that was
included for 2011 but not in 2012.

_Other operating income_

Other operating income increased by €1.2 million, or 11.9%, to €11.2 million in the year ended
December 31, 2012, from €10.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to
increased income from capitalized development costs, waste disposal and release of provisions from prior
periods.

_Cost of materials_

Cost of materials increased by €39.5 million, or 18.7%, to €250.4 million in the year ended December 31,
2012, from €210.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to increased
sales volume in all regions, but primarily in Asia. However, materials as a percentage of sales decreased from
54.4% to 53.7% due to efficiency savings and reduced cost of raw materials, with the most pronounced effect in
China. In China, cost of materials as a percentage of sales decreased from 71.2% to 65.4%.

_Personnel expense_

Personnel expense increased, by €9.7 million, or 12.4%, to €87.9 million in the year ended December 31,
2012, from €78.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to increased
sales volume and inflationary pay rises. However, personnel expense as a percentage of sales decreased from
20.2% in 2011 to 18.9% in 2012.

_Amortization and depreciation_

Amortization and depreciation increased, by €4.0 million, or 9.2%, to €47.8 million in the year ended
December 31, 2012, from €43.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to
the higher amortization of purchase price allocation for the fair value uplift on intangibles in 2012.

_Other operating expenses_

Other operating expenses increased by €17.4 million, or 25.0%, to €87.0 million in the year ended
December 31, 2012, from €69.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to
increased freight and packaging as well as production materials, expenses and building and occupancy costs. In
addition, we experienced an increase in temporary production personnel, a warranty provision increase (including
a change in estimate) and increased normalized consultancy and project-based costs.

_Other and similar income_

Other and similar income increased marginally by €0.1 million, or 5.1%, to €0.5 million in the year ended
December 31, 2012, from €0.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2011.

_Interest and similar expenses_

Interest and similar expenses increased by €0.6 million, or 3.0%, to €20.1 million in the year ended
December 31, 2012, from €19.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to
our payment in kind interest expense on our shareholder loan.

_Loss on ordinary activities_

Loss on ordinary activities decreased by €11.3 million, or 42.1%, to a loss of €15.6 million in the year ended
December 31, 2012, from a loss of €26.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease was due to
the factors described above.

_Taxes on income_

Taxes on income increased by €3.2 million, or 94.0%, to €6.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012,
from €3.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to an increase in taxable
income.

_Other taxes_

Other taxes increased by €1.2 million, or 110.7%, to €2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012,
from €1.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to a one off value added
tax (“VAT”) audit impact in Germany for non-recoverable VAT in the year ended December 31, 2012.

_Consolidated net loss for the year_

Consolidated net loss for the year decreased by €6.9 million, or 22.1%, to €24.5 million in the year ended
December 31, 2012, from €31.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease was due to the
factors described above.

**_Qualitative Discussion of Sales in the Periods from 2004 to 2010_**

Our financial statements for the periods from 2004 to 2010 have been prepared on the basis of German
GAAP. Our sales increased each year since the year ended December 31, 2004, until the year ended
December 31, 2008. In the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010, our sales were lower than in the year ended
December 31, 2008. Our EBITDA margin has exceeded 10% on average since 2004 due to strict cost
management. Despite the decrease in sales in the years 2009 and 2010, our EBITDA margin in the year ended
December 31, 2009 exceeded the value in the prior year, and our EBITDA margin for the year ended
December 31, 2010 was approximately equal to the value for 2008. The following table presents our results for

be, our cashflows from operations. Following the Completion Date, our principal source of liquidity is expected
to be our cashflows from operations, as well as drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility. We will use the
proceeds from the Offering of the Notes together with the proceeds of the New Term Loan B Facility and the
Equity Contribution to fund the consideration payable for the shares of the Target, repay all amounts outstanding
under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and certain other debt of the Target’s subsidiaries and pay the
estimated fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds,”


Our ability to generate sufficient cash for our ongoing operations depends on our operating performance,
which in turn depends to some extent on general economic, financial, industry, regulatory and other factors,
many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in “Risk Factors.” We believe that,
based on our current level of operations as reflected in our results of operations for the year ended December 31,
2013, our cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand and the availability of borrowings under our
Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital expenditures and debt service for at
least the next 12 months.

Until the Completion Date, we will have access to funds under our Existing Senior Facilities. Following the
Completion Date, we will have access to funds under our Senior Facilities. The availability of the Senior
Facilities, including the Revolving Credit Facility, will be subject to certain conditions. We anticipate that we
will be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future, and under certain circumstances, obligated to comply with a
financial maintenance covenant. Our high level of debt may have important negative consequences for you. See
“Risk Factors.” There are also limitations on our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing. See
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Description of Certain
Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities.” In addition, any additional indebtedness that we do incur could
reduce the amount of our cash flow available to make payments on our then existing indebtedness, including
under the Notes offered hereby, and increase our leverage.

**_Cash Pooling Arrangements_**

We implemented a zero-balancing cash pool for our subsidiaries located in the euro zone in June 2011. The
master account holder is Wittur Holding GmbH, and all Wittur Group members located in the euro zone are
connected via their local banks to the cash pool. Local positive bank balances are transferred automatically to
Wittur Holding GmbH at the end of a German bank working day and bank balances at local banks are
automatically balanced by Wittur Holding GmbH at the end of a German bank working day. As needed, we also
have other credit lines, including, following consummation of the Transactions, under the Revolving Credit
Facility, available for utilization.

**_Entrustment Loan Arrangements in China_**

Chinese regulations currently severely restrict intercompany lending between subsidiaries within a group,
which in turn limits our ability to extract the cash generated by our Chinese operations. Currently, the only
authorized means of intercompany borrowing is by way of an entrustment loan using an international bank as
entrustment facilitator. In 2013, the Target, as borrower, entered into an entrustment loan agreement with Wittur
China, as lender, and Commerzbank Shanghai, as entrustment facilitator, pursuant to which several tranches of
loans up to an aggregate of RMB 150.0 million can be drawn. Under the entrustment loan agreement, Wittur
China makes a payment to Commerzbank Shanghai which in turn transfers the funds received to the Target’s
RMB-denominated account with Commerzbank Frankfurt, where the funds are translated into euro.
Commerzbank Shanghai does not assume any loan risk but collects certain handling charges and the entrustment
loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.2%, which is set by the People’s Bank of China. Pursuant to the
entrustment loan agreement, the Target can repay outstanding loans at any time, and we constantly monitor the
liquidity requirements of Wittur China and respond to any liquidity shortfalls through repayments of outstanding
entrustment loans. The entrustment loan arrangement is currently scheduled to expire in 2018. As of September
30, 2014, €12.8 million had been drawn under the entrustment loan.

**_Working Capital_**

We define working capital as the sum of inventories, trade receivables and other current assets, less trade
payables and other current liabilities. The following table provides an overview of our working capital as of
December 31, 2012, 2013 and September 30, 2014:

(1) Working capital is a Non-GAAP financial measure and, as such, has not been audited for any of the periods presented.

Our effective management of working capital levels, particularly through sharing best practices among
different jurisdictions, and the large proportion of our revenues derived globally operating MNCs, has allowed us
to maintain our working capital requirements below 10% of our revenues since 2012. In 2012 and 2013, we
undertook a policy of active working capital management which included delaying payments of receivables and
early payment of payables and so distorts the working capital changes in 2012 and 2013.

_Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014_

Cash generated from operations (excluding working capital changes)

Cash generated from operations (excluding working capital changes) increased by €8.8 million, or 19.1%, to
€54.8 million in the nine months September 30, 2014, from €46.0 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2013. This increase was primarily due to increased earnings before tax and reduced interest
expense and depreciation charges.

Net cash flow from operating activities

Net cash flow from operating activities increased by €11.5 million, or 31.4%, to €48.3 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2014, from €36.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The
increase was primarily due to lower working capital requirements as a result of seasonal fluctuations in supplier
payments at the end of the third quarter due to a holiday in China, partially offset by higher income taxes paid.

Net cash flow used in investing activities

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased by €0.5 million, or 12.0%, to €3.7 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2014, from €4.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. This
decrease was primarily due to the completion of our plant in Slovakia, which had increased purchase of property,
plant & equipment in the nine months ended September 30, 2013.

In the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we incurred capital expenditures of €5.3 million, of which
we incurred €4.3 million in our Europe region, €0.6 million in our Asia region and €0.4 million in our Rest of the
World region, mainly related to investments in property, plant, and equipment as well as intangibles. In the nine
months ended September 30, 2013, we incurred capital expenditures of €5.7 million, of which we incurred
€2.4 million in our Europe region, €2.5 million in our Asia region and €0.7 million in our Rest of the World
region. Capital expenditure in Asia in 2013 mainly results from our investments in our new plant in China in
connection with our expansion in the Chinese market.

Net cash flow used in financing activities

Net cash flow used in financing activities increased by €10.8 million, or 59.1%, to €29.2 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 2014, from €18.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. This
increase was primarily due to the repayment of our ancillary bank facility in January 2014.

_Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013_

Cash generated from operations (excluding working capital changes)

Cash generated from operations (excluding working capital changes) increased by €10.5 million, or 20.9%,
to €60.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, from €50.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012.
This increase was primarily due to increased earnings before tax. These increased earnings before tax were a
result of increased gross profit from higher sales volumes, improved operational efficiency and purchasing
savings and reduced administrative expenses, primarily due to reduced costs for restructuring and one-off
improvement projects.

Net cash flow from operating activities

Net cash flow from operating activities decreased by €3.9 million, or 10.1%, to €34.6 million in the year
ended December 31, 2013, from €38.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease was mainly
due to increased working capital requirements as a result of delayed cash receipts from customers, as well as the
early payment of supplier invoices in December 2013.

Net cash flow used in investing activities

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased by €2.1 million, or 22.2%, to €11.3 million in the year
ended December 31, 2013, from €9.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease was primarily
due to the expansion of our plant in China which opened in the second quarter 2013.

Net cash flow used in financing activities

Net cash flow used in financing activities decreased by €1.2 million, or 4.7%, to €25.2 million in the year
ended December 31, 2013, from €26.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease was
primarily due to the drawdown of our ancillary bank facility in December 2013, which we used as a cash bridge
while we were awaiting the currency conversion of borrowings under our China entrustment loan from Chinese
renminbi to euro, partially offset by the cost of refinancing fees associated with the implementation of a new
term loan C under our Existing Senior Facilities, which we used to partially repay outstanding shareholder loans.

(*) The financial information as of and for the year ended December 2011 and 2012 has been derived from the 2012 Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements which were prepared on the basis of German GAAP. Please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Differences between German GAAP and IFRS.”

**_Cash flow from operating activities_**

Cash flow from operating activities increased by €21.1 million, or 237.8%, to €30.0 million in the year
ended December 31, 2012, from €8.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily
due to reduced losses before tax as detailed in the discussion of our results of operations in the year ended
December 31, 2012 above.

**_Cash flow from investing activities_**

Cash flow from investing activities increased by €0.4 million, or 4.6%, to €9.3 million in the year ended
December 31, 2012, from €8.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to
capital expenditures in China for the commencement of construction of the new production plant. In year ended
December 31, 2011, there was capital expenditures for our India plant but the overall value was less in 2011.
Nonetheless, capital expenditures for maintenance and replacement has remained fairly stable each year.

**_Cash flow used in financing activities_**

Cash flow used in financing activities decreased by €163.1 million, or 90.1%, to a cash outflow of
€18.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, from a cash outflow of €181.1 million in the year ended
December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to a temporary cash bridge in December 2010 upon our
acquisition by the new shareholder, which was repaid towards the beginning of the year ended December 31,
2011 after finalizing the Senior Facility Agreement.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

To support our business strategy and development plans and to further expand our business operations in
new markets, such as China, we regularly incur capital expenditures. In the years ended December 31, 2012 and
2013, we incurred capital expenditures of €9.7 million, or 2.1% of revenue, and €12.9 million, or 2.7% of
revenue, respectively.

The following table presents our capital expenditures by period. Expansion capital expenditures mainly
relate to entering and establishing production facilities and a sales force in new markets, expanding production of
our existing facilities and entering into production of new products. Maintenance capital expenditures mainly
relate to maintaining our existing operations and replacing existing property, plant & equipment.

**Capital expenditures . . . . . . . . .** **9.1** **9.7** **12.9** **5.7** **5.3** **12.6**

We incurred €5.3 million of capital expenditures in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, of which
€2.3 million were maintenance capital expenditures. We expect capital expenditures for the year ended
December 31, 2014 to amount to approximately €12.5 million, approximately €8.0 million of which was
expansion capital expenditure (primarily related to capital expenditure for our plant in Slovakia) and
approximately €4.5 million of which was maintenance capital expenditure. Typically, our maintenance capital
expenditures are concentrated at the end of a given year.

For the year ending December 31, 2015, our management expects to incur capital expenditures in the
amount of €11.5 million. Major projects in the year ending December 31, 2015 include investments in emerging
economies, such as China, Brazil, India and Turkey, to further expand our business operation in these fastgrowing markets. Furthermore, we anticipate capital expenditures in future periods to amount to approximately
2% of revenue, which we believe will be sufficient to support the ongoing growth of our business.

**Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities**

obligations. These maturities may differ significantly from the actual maturity of these obligations. The table
above also mainly reflects those agreements and obligations that are customary and necessary in light of the
activities in which we engage. We believe that our cash generated from operating activities and amounts
available under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to satisfy present working capital requirements.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

Our off-balance sheet commitments include operating leases relating to buildings, machinery and vehicles.
Operating leases as of September 30, 2014 increased compared to December 31, 2013, primarily as a result of
our execution of a 15-year operating lease relating to a new plant in Brazil. The following table provides an
overview of our scheduled minimum operating lease payments as of December 31, 2012 and 2013 and
September 30, 2014:

**Pension Obligations**

We offer various types of retirement benefits to certain of our employees worldwide, either directly or by
contributing to independently administered funds. In particular, we have defined benefit pension plans in Austria
and Italy. As of September 30, 2014, we had retirement and benefit obligations and obligations relating to
indemnities for the termination of employment contracts in accordance with applicable local law (mainly Italian
and Austrian law) in an amount of €2.4 million and €7.3 million, respectively.

We have historically funded payments required to be made under these pension plans with cash flow from
operating activities, and we anticipate continuing doing so going forward.

**Qualitative Disclosure on Market Risk**

We are exposed to a number of financial risks arising from the ordinary course of business, such as credit
risks, foreign exchange risk and interest rate risks. Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows
of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk consists of the following
types of risk: foreign currency exchange rate risk; and interest rate risk. Financial instruments exposed to market
risk include interest-bearing loans and derivative financial instruments.

**_Foreign Exchange Risk_**

Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognized assets and liabilities and net
investments in foreign operations. Foreign currency exposures of individual affiliates are managed and optimized
against the functional currency of the respective entity. Foreign currency risks exist for us as we undertake sales
and purchases in different currency. We analyse the underlying risks and implement procedures we deem
adequate to mitigate such risks.

We are exposed to foreign currency risks due to our operating activities. Although our subsidiaries mainly
operate in their individual functional currency, some of our subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk
based on planned payments in a currency other than their functional currency. The euro, the Chinese renminbi
and the Turkish lira are the only currencies material to us.

We do not at present engage in any currency hedging to mitigate foreign exchange risk.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Interest rate risk is the risk of fair values or cash flows being negatively affected by changes in interest rates.
We are exposed to interest rate risks from loans with variable interest rates, which, following the Transactions,
will primarily consist of variable interest rate loans under the Senior Facilities.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

When applying our accounting policies, management must make assumptions and estimates concerning the
future that affect the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the statement of financial position date, the
disclosure of contingencies that existed at the balance sheet date and the amounts of net sales and expenses
recognized during the accounting period. Such assumptions and estimates are based on factors such as historical
experience, the observance of trends in the industries in which we operate and information available from our
customers and other outside sources.

Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making assumptions and estimates, actual outcomes could differ
from those assumptions and estimates. An analysis of the key sources of estimation uncertainty at the statement
of financial position date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of
our assets and liabilities in the next financial year is presented below.

**_General Provisions_**

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying
assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in
which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

The assumptions and estimates principally relate to the consolidation of business combinations, the
assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amount of intangible assets (in particular goodwill), the groupwide determination of useful lives of material assets, taxation and the recognition of deferred tax assets and the
measurement and recognition of provisions for pensions and other provisions. Assumptions and estimates are
based on premises derived from knowledge at the time.

Within the scope of business combinations, general estimates are also made when determining the fair
values of the assets acquired. In principle fair value is determined based on the prognosis of future cash flow.

_Economic Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets_

The applied economic lives of non-current assets are based on estimates of the management. We review the
estimated economic useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at the end of every
financial year.

_Taxation_

The Target and its subsidiaries are subject to routine tax audits and also a process whereby tax computations
are discussed and agreed with the respective authorities. While the ultimate outcome of such tax audits and
discussions cannot be determined with certainty, management estimates the level of provisions required for both
current and deferred tax on the basis of professional advice and the nature of current discussions with the tax
authority concerned.

_Estimates and Assumptions_

The key assumptions concerning the future economic situation and other key sources of estimation
uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.

_Impairment of Non-Financial Assets_

We assess whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting date.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and at other times when such indicators exist. Other non-financial
assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

_Deferred Tax Assets_

Management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized
based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future
tax planning strategies.

95


-----

_Fair Value of Financial Instruments_

We measure financial instruments, such as, derivatives, and non-financial assets such as investment
properties, at fair value at each balance sheet date. Also, fair values of financial instruments measured at
amortised cost are disclosed in Note 7 Additional disclosures on financial instruments to the 2013 Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use
when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair
value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use
the asset in its highest and best use.

We use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are
available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of
unobservable inputs.

The fair values of the derivatives are presented in the balance sheet on a gross basis.

_Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits_

The carrying amount of defined benefit pensions plans and other post-employment benefits are based on
actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuations involved making assumptions about discount rates, expected rates
of return on assets, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long term
nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.

_Other Provisions_

Such provisions are recognized when it is considered probable that economical, legal, ecological and
decommissioning obligations will result in future outflows of economic benefits, when the costs can be estimated
reliably and the measures in question are not expected to result in future inflows of economic benefits. The
estimate of future costs is subject to many uncertainties, including legal uncertainties based on the applicable
laws and regulations and with uncertainties regarding to the actual conditions in the different countries and
operating locations. In particular, estimates of costs are based on earlier experiences in similar cases, the
conclusions of expert opinions commissioned by us, current costs and new developments that have a bearing on
the costs. Any changes to these estimates could have an impact on our future results.

**Differences between German GAAP and IFRS**

Our 2012 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with German
GAAP, whereas our 2013 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and our Unaudited Interim Consolidated
Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS which differs in certain respects from German
GAAP. The following paragraphs summarize certain significant differences between German GAAP and IFRS as
of December 31, 2012.

The organizations that promulgate IFRS have ongoing projects that could have significant impact on future
comparisons of German GAAP and IFRS. This description is not intended to provide a comprehensive listing of
all such differences specifically related to us or the business in which we operate. We have not attempted to
identify all disclosure, presentations or classification differences that would affect the manner in which
transactions and events are presented in the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements or the notes thereto,
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

Our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 were prepared on the basis of
German GAAP and not in accordance with IFRS. In addition, our 2012 Audited Financial Statements have been
prepared on the basis of German GAAP and not in accordance with IFRS, even though our 2013 Audited
Financial Statements include a reconciliation from German GAAP to IFRS for the year ended December 31,
2012. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the differences described below would, in fact, be the accounting
principles creating the greatest material differences between our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements
prepared under German GAAP and under IFRS. In addition, we cannot estimate the net effect that applying IFRS
would have on our results of operations or our financial position, or any part of them, in any of the presentations

96


-----

of financial information in this offering memorandum. The effect of such differences may be material and, in
particular, total shareholders’ equity (capital debit) and net income prepared on the basis of IFRS may be
materially different due to these differences. For example, our sales for the year ended December 31, 2012
presented on the basis of German GAAP are approximately €10.1 million higher than our revenue for the same
period when presented in accordance with IFRS; this reflects the sale of the operations of Wittur Hydraulic
Drives GmbH in 2013, which was classified as discontinued operations for purposes of the 2013 Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements and therefore was excluded from the presentation of revenues under IFRS, but
not from the presentation of sales under German GAAP. For additional details, please see note 5.9 to the 2013
Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Financial Statement Presentation_**

Under IFRS, the presentation of the balance sheet is based on a current/non-current distinction of assets and
liabilities. IFRS requires the presentation of assets and liabilities in order of liquidity only when a liquidity
presentation provides information that is reliable and is more relevant than a current/non-current presentation.
Under German GAAP, the presentation of the balance sheet is based on liquidity of the assets and liabilities. In
addition, the regulations concerning the presentation of financial statements under IFRS could lead to different
disclosures in the balance sheet and the income statements compared to German GAAP.

The disclosures required in the explanatory notes to the financial statements are more extensive under IFRS
than under German GAAP.

**_Business Combinations_**

Under German GAAP and IFRS, the acquisition method of accounting is applied. Similar to IFRS, German
GAAP requires the recognition of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of the fair value at the
time of acquisition. Similar to IFRS, German GAAP requires recognizing goodwill from a business combination
at the amount by which the purchase price for the acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired at
the date of the acquisition. However, prior to the adoption of the German Accounting Modernization Act
(Bilanzrechtsmoderinsierungsgesetz) in 2010, German GAAP allowed the application of the book value method
and this method was used to account for the acquisition of the Group in 2007. Therefore, the complete difference
between the acquisition costs and the proportionate equity share acquired was recognized as goodwill in the
German GAAP consolidated financial statements of the Group. As a result, no fair value adjustments regarding
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized and the resulting goodwill recognized under German
GAAP differs from the goodwill which would have been recognized under IFRS.

Under IFRS, transaction costs related to the acquisition are immediately recognized as an expense. Under
German GAAP certain costs directly attributable to the acquisition can be capitalized as goodwill along with the
purchase price.

**_Impairment of Assets_**

Under IFRS, an impairment loss is recognized if the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying
amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s fair value less costs of
disposal and its value in use. The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does
not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or group of assets. If this is the
case, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs, unless either
the asset’s fair value less costs of disposal is higher than its carrying amount; or the asset’s value in use can be
estimated to be close to its fair value less costs of disposal and fair value less costs of disposal can be measured.

Under German GAAP, an impairment loss for long-lived assets must only be recorded if a permanent
impairment in value is anticipated. An impairment loss is recognized under German GAAP if the fair value less
cost to sell is permanently expected to be lower than the carrying amount of an asset. The concept of cash
generating units is not applicable under German GAAP, and impairment loss is determined on an item-by-item
basis.

_Amortization, depreciation and impairment on intangible and tangible assets_

Under IFRS and German GAAP, amortization and depreciation are based on the useful life of the asset.
However, under German GAAP all intangible and tangible assets are subject to amortization and depreciation,

97


-----

whereas under IFRS intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not amortized but are
only subject to an impairment test which is at least performed on an annual basis. We amortize goodwill in our
German GAAP financial statements mainly over a period of five years.

**_Leasing_**

Under IFRS, a lease has to be classified either as an operating lease or as a finance lease. A finance lease is
a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of leased assets. Title may or
may not eventually be transferred. For a finance lease, the lessee recognizes an asset and a liability at an amount
equal to the lower of the fair value of leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments, each
determined at the inception of the lease. The discount rate to be used in calculating the present value of the
minimum lease payments is the interest rate implicit in the lease, if this is practicable to determine; if not, the
lessee’s incremental borrowing rate shall be used. Any initial direct costs of the lessee are added to the amount
recognized as an asset. Operating leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term
unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern of the user’s benefit.

Under German GAAP, accounting for leases is primarily due to certain decrees of the Federal Ministry of
Finance, to determine whether capitalization at the lessee level is required. These rules differ from IFRS rules in
several respects. Some leases specified as operating lease under German GAAP may qualify as a finance lease
under IFRS.

**_Provision for Pensions_**

Under German GAAP and IFRS, post-employment benefits are classified either as defined contributions or
defined benefit plans. Under IFRS it is required to use the projected unit credit method to determine the present
value of the entity’s defined benefit obligation, whereas under German GAAP the use of the projected unit credit
method is only one of the permissible actuarial valuation methods. We use the tax driven entry age normal
method as the actuarial method to calculate our pension liabilities.

A major difference between German GAAP and IFRS is the discount rate used to discount post-employment
benefit obligations. Under IFRS the discount rate is determined by reference to market yields of high quality
corporate bonds at the end of the reporting period. Under German GAAP the determination of the discount is
determined on the average market yields for the past seven years.

Under German GAAP, all changes in the pension liability are recognized in the income statement, whereas
under IFRS certain changes in the pension liability are recognized in the other comprehensive income.

The amount which has to be accounted for as a liability from a defined benefit plan equals of the cash value
of the defined benefit pension obligation, less the fair value of the plan assets which exist for the direct
fulfillment of the obligation.

**_Provisions and Contingencies_**

Under IFRS, provisions are recognized if an enterprise has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it
is probable (meaning, more likely than not) that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

Under German GAAP, the criteria for the recognition of provisions and contingencies are less detailed and
prescriptive than under IFRS. Provisions must be carried at the amount required to settle the obligation based on
sound business judgment in accordance with the principle of a prudent businessman. Under German GAAP the
discount rate is determined on the average market yields for the past seven years, whereas the discount rate
according to IFRS reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
liability.

**_Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging_**

Under IFRS, derivative financial instruments (for example interest rate swaps) are recorded in the
consolidated statements of financial position at fair value (mark-to-market) on the acquisition date. Changes in
the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings or as separate component of equity, depending
on whether a derivative is designated as a part of a hedge transaction and the type of the hedge transaction.

98


-----

Under German GAAP, there is no distinction in the accounting treatment between fair value hedges, cash
flow hedges and hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. If a derivative financial instrument and its
related underlying instrument are designated as a hedge for a particular risk exposure (“Valuation Unit”), and
the hedge is considered to be effective, the changes of the fair value of the hedging instrument and the hedged
item are netted in the income statement line of the hedged items. Therefore, the effective portion of the hedged
item and the hedging instrument remains unrecognized. However, under German GAAP a provision for
anticipated contract losses is recognized for the portion of the negative market values of the interest rate swaps
exceeding the underlying transactions as well as for the ineffective portion of the Valuation Units. Unrealized
gains are not recognized under German GAAP.

If the liabilities to banks relate to floating rate interest-bearing loans, respective swaps are entered into to fix
the interest rates. If the requirements are met, hedging instruments and hedged items are combined to form a
Valuation Unit and are accounted for using the net hedge presentation method. In accordance with the net hedge
presentation method, the effective portion of the hedged item and the hedging instrument remains unrecognized
as long as the hedge is effective. The hedge effectiveness is determined by means of the dollar-offset-method. A
provision for anticipated contract losses is recognized for the portion of the negative market values of the interest
rate swaps exceeding the hedged item as well as for the ineffective portion of the Valuation Units. Unrealized
gains for the hedging instruments and the hedged items are not recognized.

**_Prepaid Expenses for Bank Loans_**

Under German GAAP, prepaid expenses in connection with a bank loan are included in prepaid expenses on
the assets side of the balance sheet and amortized by systematic annual charges over the full time of the liability.
Under IFRS, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the originated bank loan are amortized through
profit or loss over the term of the loan using the effective interest method.

**Elevator and Elevator Components Market**

**_Elevator and elevator components market structure_**

The global elevator market is estimated to be worth approximately €64 billion in 2014. The elevator market
can be broken down into three major sub-segments: components (43% of the market); value added on
components by elevator installer (13%); and installation, maintenance and modernization services (44%) (source:
_Global consulting firm). According to a Global consulting firm, demand for elevator units grew more quickly_
than construction demand and real GDP from 1996 to 2012: during this period the World real GDP grew at a
CAGR of 3.0%; and the World construction demand at a CAGR of 4.3%, whereas the world unit (real) elevator
demand grew at a CAGR of 9.5%. Elevators as such have been growing in excess of GDP over many decades,
with penetration increasing. Elevator growth has been more gradual in more mature regions (sales in those
regions are driven by demand for modernization and maintenance of the installed elevator base), and more rapid
in emerging markets (driven by strong demand for new installations of elevators).

Elevators are a key part of the functionality of a building. However, they represent only a small portion of
the total building construction costs. The core business of elevator companies is the development, installation and
servicing of elevators, as well as the production of some of the components. A significant portion of component
manufacturing is outsourced by elevator companies to independent suppliers, such as Wittur.

We estimate that as of December 31, 2014, approximately 55% of the total components market for doors
and drives was outsourced to suppliers, as opposed to 45% produced in-house by MNCs. Our industry has
exhibited a trend towards outsourcing in the past, which is expected to continue in the future, driven by MNCs
and others focusing on the installation and service business.

Our addressable market is estimated to amount to €8.68 billion in 2014 (as calculated by comparing the
€27.7 billion total components market, with our core products covering a product spectrum that represented 57%
at an outsourcing share of 55%) (source: Global consulting firm).

The elevator components market can be segmented by a number of different perspectives.

_Components. The largest share of revenues in terms of products in 2014 was estimated to be represented by_
landing/car doors (19%), followed by drives and control/electronics systems, with 14% and 12%, respectively.
Slings, cars and safeties are estimated to account for 11%, 10% and 3%, respectively, of revenues, while the
remaining 31% of revenues mainly includes car frames, counterweight frames, shaft equipment, suspensions and
others (Source: Global consulting firm).

_Elevator type. Low rise elevators were estimated to represent close to half of the total market (49%) in 2014,_
while mid-rise elevators are estimated at 38% and high-rise elevators at 13% of the total market, respectively.
High-rise elevators represent the most value added in terms of technology and are expected to experience the
strongest growth in the coming years on the back of demographic changes affecting building engineering
(Source: Global consulting firm).

_Geography. As of September 30, 2014, China was the largest market for elevator components, with an_
estimated share of 53% of total revenues. The size of the Chinese market is primarily driven by strong volume
expansion on the back of ongoing urbanization, increasing floor space per capita driven by higher GDP per
capita, increasing population density and thus more vertical construction in urban areas. The second largest
market for elevator components is Europe and Africa with an estimated share of 18% of total revenues (although
still having the largest installed base as of today) followed by Asia Pacific excluding China (estimated at 16%),
Americas (estimated at 7%) and Eurasia (estimated at 5%) (Source: Global consulting firm).

_Project type. New installations comprise most of the total components market, with an estimated total share_
of 76% in 2014, mainly due to rapid construction growth in China. Modernization is estimated at 24% of the total
components market and is mainly sustained by a sizeable aging installed base in traditional economies (i.e.,
Europe), but in the future increasingly also by China (Source: Global consulting firm).

_Customers. Western MNCs were estimated to account for approximately 43% of the market in 2012, Asian_
MNCs for around an estimated 18% while the remaining approximately 39% is estimated for Independents
(Source: Global consulting firm).

_Outsourcing. In 2014, the four largest MNCs are estimated to have outsourced the production of 55% of_
components of doors and drives by value, with the remainder being produced internally (Source: Global
_consulting firm). The outsourcing market has grown over time._

**Our Positioning in the Elevator Value Chain**

The following chart sets out our positioning in the elevator value chain.

(Source: Global consulting firm).

Our involvement in all areas of the value chain, from development to manufacturing and delivery of
components, modules and complete elevators, gives us a strong position in the elevator components value chain.
We offer customization of our products, which, combined with delivery of products which comply with local
laws and regulations in all regions in which we operate, is a relevant aspect for both MNCs and Independents in
order to choose a supplier for their elevator components.

Although we are not active in the area of installation and service, we supply products to some of our
customers that focus in such area, by providing them modernization solutions and spare parts.

Suppliers play a critical role in supporting MNCs by maintaining high quality and safety standards. This is
due to the fact that MNCs are responsible for elevator performance and service, and thus have to rely on the
quality of the components of their end products they get from their suppliers. As a consequence, MNCs closely
inspect the quality of products coming from their suppliers. Quality and regulatory standards must be adhered to
and all used components and complete elevators must be certified, which makes changing suppliers difficult.

Demand for elevators and elevator components is essentially driven by new installations as well as the
evolution of the installed base, the former driving demand for new equipment, the latter driving the demand for

-----

spare parts and upgrades and modernization solutions. Demand for new installations and modernizations and
spare parts is mainly driven by a number of key trends: population growth; aging populations; growing GDP per
capita; urbanization; growing floor space per capita; growing; and aging of the installed base and growing
demand for regulation and safety. In addition, demand for elevator components is also favorably affected by
outsourcing decisions by MNCs.

**_Global outsourced components market growth_**

Growth in the demand for outsourced components was estimated to be 15.4% from 2007 to 2013, mainly
due to China, as the region grew significantly compared to the other regions on the same period by a CAGR of
31.8%, as shown in the below chart.

We expect demand for outsourced components to continue to grow. Emerging markets growth (in particular
in China) has to date been mainly driven by new installations. In the future, an aging installed base and
increasing regulatory requirements are expected to lead to increasing growth of modernization revenues. Demand
in the Europe and Africa region is also expected to grow, and the modernization segment in Europe and Africa is
estimated to account for 35% of the total outsourced components market in this region in 2013 (source: Global
_consulting firm)._

The map below sets out the differences by region in the global elevator market in 2013, comparing
estimated installed base units and new installation. Europe is the core of the modernization market, while China
is the core of the new installation market.

**_European components market_**

The European market for outsourced elevator components has been relatively stable in recent years, given
that the region is already a mature market (source: Global consulting firm). Despite this, we have consistently
achieved a higher growth ahead of the market in Europe, as shown in the table below.

Our strategy for Europe includes continuing our relationship with MNCs and to sharing new opportunities
with them. We work closely with our key account MNC customers, and are in constant contact with them to
increase our business with them and benefit from upcoming outsourcing decisions. We are also increasing our
focus on new opportunities with Independents, through a significant investment in the size and training of our
sales force. Finally, we are also relocating some of our standard doors production to certain low cost locations
such as Krupina in Slovakia, in order to increase profitability independently of market growth.

**_Asian components market_**

In recent years, the demand for elevators in Asia, and particularly in China, has strongly grown and has done
so above construction demand, due to rising penetration in the market. There are four different key drivers of this
growth of the Chinese elevator demand: (i) urbanization, which to date has progressed in line with other largescale urbanization trends (e.g., Japan, Korea and Russia); (ii) increasing urban residential floor space per capita,
which shows a strong correlation with rising GDP across many countries globally; (iii) an increasing elevator
density in new construction in China, although overall elevator density currently still low if compared with more
mature markets (it accounts roughly for half the level of Italy); and (iv) the importance of the aftermarket and
modernization to come, driven by the Chinese installed base of elevators growth over the last decade (source:
_Global consulting firm)._

The demand in the Chinese market for outsourced elevator components to date is mostly driven by new
installations. Among the individual growth drivers, the continuous urbanization trend driving demand for highrise buildings in cities is the single largest factor, followed by overall building growth, which is, however,
projected to slow down slightly compared to historical levels. Given an increasing, and aging, installed base and
enhanced regulatory requirements, we expect modernization demand for outsourced elevator components to
increase significantly, albeit starting from a comparatively low base. Finally, the existing trend towards
outsourcing is expected to continue and expand, accompanied by minor anticipated unit value reductions (source:
_Global consulting firm)._

**_China—Short-term real estate outlook_**

juxtaposed against elevator growth in years in which inventory is destocking, as it did in the second half of 2014.
This data shows that Chinese housing inventory increased during 2013 and the first half of 2014, but that such
increase did not exceed previous peaks in the recent past and has already corrected significantly.

The Rest of the World region can be sub-divided into two geographies, for which we have differentiated
strategies.

_Eurasia. We currently have one plant in Turkey, where we produce doors, cars and complete elevators, with_
a total of 181 local employees working in production. Our strategy to grow further in the region will be based on
a significant sales force investment and on introducing a lower cost product to reach a wider customer base, with
a focus on high volume sales through MNCs.

_Latin America. We currently have one plant in Argentina and another one in Brazil, where we produce_
doors, cars and complete elevators, with a total of 195 local employees working in production. We have
benefited from solid market growth, and are currently building a new plant in Brazil to enhance our product
offering and profitability.

**Trends Supporting Demand for New Elevators and Modernization and Spare Parts**


**_New installations_**

New installations of elevators are expected to continue to be the main driver of demand in the elevator
components market in the future (source: Global consulting firm).

The underlying trends supporting this growth are overall population growth, continued urbanization,
increased floor space per capita driven by growing GDP and aging of the population. According to the World
Bank, 60% of new urban consumers will be located in 440 emerging market cities by 2025 (source: McKinsey
_Global Institute, Urban World: Cities and the rise of the consuming class, June 2012)._

The growth of the global population is anticipated to further continue with the global population expected to
reach 9.3 billion by 2050 (source: World Bank). The population in China is forecast to grow by 200 million until
2017 (source: World Bank). This overall increase in population is supported by urbanization, which is relatively
independent of changes in the macroeconomic climate. China’s urbanization rate in 2013 was more than 50%
which is equal to the urbanization rates of South Korea in the 1980s and Japan during the 1950s and 1960s
(source: China National Human Development Report 2013). South Korea’s and Japan’s urbanization rate in 2013
stood at 82% and 92%, respectively (source: World Bank).

In 2010, urban population for the first time in history surpassed rural population, and is expected to
significantly increase in the future (source: World Bank). Higher urbanization should drive demand for high rise
buildings, which boosts demand for elevators and their respective components.

In addition to the long term trend of urbanization, people in our key markets are expected to gain wealth and
income, expressed through increasing GDP per capita (both in Western Europe and China), driving increasing
floor space per capita and therefore demand for new elevators. Life expectancy is also expected to lengthen
significantly (source: World Bank).

Expanding wealth and increasing incomes are expected to correlate with increasing demand for larger
residential floor space per capita. Such increasing floor space demand is mostly accompanied by an expectation
for elevators to be included in such building projects, as a convenience and prestige factor. Aging populations,
particularly in urban regions, also imply rising demand for elevator installations either as part of modernization
measures to make buildings more “elder friendly”, as well as by new installations for dedicated building projects
targeting the 65 and over population.

Growth in construction activity should also correlate with increasing elevator demand. Growth in China is
envisaged to continue, albeit at lower rates than in the past. On the other hand, a recovery of construction activity
in mature markets, including Europe, is expected (source: Global consulting firm).


**_Modernization_**

Modernization of elevators is a second key driver of the elevator market, which is expected to benefit from
further increases in the installed base. On the back of an increasingly aging installed base, demanding regulation
and safety standards and energy efficiency requirements (source: Global consulting firm).

This continuous growth and the increasing share of elevators older than ten years provides for substantially
growing demand in the modernization market. The large and mature installed base of elevators in Europe
provides a stable anchor and persisting modernization demand.

(Source: Company information). (Source: KONE investor presentation. Based on 2012 installed fleet).

Mature markets, such as Europe, are characterized by an installed base with a lifecycle of up to 40 years. In
Europe, mostly elevators within the high performance segment are installed. Installed elevators require smaller
repairs and modernization over time to ensure such exceptionally long life cycles. Whenever such measures are
required, Wittur will typically be the supplier of choice for spare parts of components Wittur has supplied when
the elevator has been installed in the first instance. In comparison, the average life cycle of Chinese elevators is
lower, resulting in a faster demand for major modernizations or already a full replacement compared to Europe.

Currently, the installed base in Europe and the United States are both equally split between elevators
younger than 20 years and those with a life span already exceeding 20 years. The installed base in China consists
almost solely of elevators and components younger than 20 years. As this installed base continues to age, further
modernization demand should develop. In addition, whereas the installed base in Europe is expected to grow
fairly slowly, the installed base in China is expected to more than double in coming years (source: Global
_consulting firm). This expanding base further increases the potential for further modernization demand._

Higher regulation and changing safety norms are a key driver of modernization demand. The most relevant
norm in Europe, the EN81-1/2, has been implemented in the 1980s, but is going to be replaced by the new
EN 81-20/50, which was introduced in July 2014, and is being implemented subject to a transition period through
July 2017. As has been the case in the past, other countries and regions are expected to follow this newly
introduced norm in the upcoming and change respective norms subsequently. These changes are expected to
trigger substantial future demand for modernization globally.

Resulting from the aforementioned number of individual growth drivers, modernization and spare parts
evolution is expected to grow and the respective market to increase in size faster than in the past. The
modernization rate is expected to further boost demand for components on the back of an increasingly aging
installed base, demanding regulation and safety standards and energy efficiency requirements.

**_Outsourcing_**

Outsourcing of components by elevator producers to suppliers is an ongoing trend which has been affecting
the sector in the past and is expected to continue in the future. Below is a table showing the estimated historical
development of outsourcing from 2008 to 2013, split by elevator component.

Key reasons driving outsourcing by elevator producers include:

    - _Focus on core activities: dedicate to core installation and maintenance business without dealing with_
potential production issues;

    - _Gain flexibility and speed: provides flexibility in terms of production capacity and locations as well as_
increases speed of penetration of new markets;

    - _Reduce asset intensity: enables cash to be freed up by avoiding capital expenditures for new production_
facilities;

    - _Realize cost savings: component suppliers can provide cost effective solutions due to higher economies_
of scale achievable;

    - _Higher margins: allows the installers to focus on the higher margin elevator installation and service_
business; and

    - _Pooling of innovation and process capabilities: consolidation of industry capacity supports outsourcing_
and allows installers to access innovation capabilities and best-in-class processes.

According to certain expert interviews carried out by a global consulting firm, different elevator companies
have adopted different outsourcing strategies, mainly due to (i) different strategic approaches as it relates to their
core business, (ii) differences in their historic/existing production footprint and (iii) different strategies for and
focus on new emerging markets:

    - Western MNCs generally have the highest proportion of outsourced components among MNCs and are
showing the strongest upward trend further sustained by increasing standardization of platforms, which
enables them to reduce complexity and cost of their own product offering. The outsourcing rates
among the ‘Big 4’ participants remain similar to date, though Kone has outsourced the most over time
(source: Expert interviews, Global consulting firm).

    - Asian MNCs have historically been more reluctant to significantly outsource production and are not
expected to drastically change this strategy in the near future. However, Asian MNCs are expected to
outsource some business in markets they are targeting outside their traditional home markets (e.g.,
India, South East Asia and potentially China) (source: Expert interviews, Global consulting firm).

    - Independents tend to outsource the largest portion of component modules, mainly due to lack of scale
and in-house production capabilities. Outsourcing is expected to continue, in particular on the back of
the increasing complexity of products and more restrictive standards and norms. Going forward,
leading Independents are expected to require further support by strong suppliers, which are able to
provide them with tailored solutions complying with increasingly stringent local regulations (source:
_Expert interviews, Global consulting firm)._

111


-----

The elevator components industry lags behind the automotive industry in terms of share of components
outsourced, but has historically followed a similar trend. The automotive industry has experienced significant
value-add migration to outsourced suppliers while undergoing significant supplier consolidation. Given such
trends, we believe a leading company like ours has to opportunity to grow even more through consolidation.

**_Limited risk of insourcing_**

An MNC’s decision to outsource the production of its components is usually definitive and cannot easily be
reversed. Some outsourcing decisions, for instance, involve the sale of the MNC’s production facility to a
supplier which was the case in our acquisition of our production facility in Scheibbs, Austria, from Kone. In
these circumstances, the MNC no longer has the requisite manufacturing facilities to produce the components.
Moreover, when exploring and penetrating fast-growing emerging markets MNCs typically rely on the installed
capacity base of their suppliers. In addition, outsourcing generally entails lower requirements for capital assets
and reduced capital expenditures for MNCs and thereby allows them to operate on a leaner cost base. Another
key obstacle to MNCs’ reintegration of component manufacturing is that they typically transfer their R&D and
innovation capabilities along with their business pursuant to their outsourcing decision. As suppliers, such as
Wittur, receive these capabilities from several MNCs, they can pool these resources, thereby becoming more
advanced in their technology than any MNC on a standalone basis and thus more competitive than MNCs.
Further, MNCs typically only produce components for their own business, whereas suppliers market and sell
their products to all MNCs as well as Independents, which provides them with greater economies of scale, so that
insourcing would create a cost disadvantage for the MNC. Moreover, outsourcing in the elevator components
industry is usually a strategic long-term decision because it involves the entirety of an MNC’s production volume
rather than merely peak volumes exceeding their in-house capacity. Lastly, some MNCs are contractually barred
from re-entering the components industry due to volume share agreements entered into between the MNC and its
supplier.

**Competitive Landscape**

We believe that we are the largest elevator component producer, with €480 million in revenue in 2013. In
2013, we estimated that we generated twice as much revenue as our next relevant competitor. The closest
competitors of Wittur are NBSL, Fermator and Sematic.

(Source: Global consulting firm).

We consider the key buying criteria for elevator components to include safety, quality, partnership potential,
delivery, sales and research and development. Out of these criteria, we believe our industry leadership in safety is
the most valuable because safety is regarded as the single most critical buying criterion for elevator installers due
to the damage elevator accidents can inflict on an elevator installer’s brand value, reputation and sales. In our
experience, the relevance of safety and high quality is particularly pronounced with respect to safety-critical
components, which benefits us due to our focus on these components and our track-record of high investments in
research and development to ensure the premium quality and reliability of our products. In addition, we believe
global safety standards in the elevator components industry are rising and we are well-positioned to anticipate
and swiftly adopt new standards and safety certification requirements. This is due to our representation on all key
standard-setting organizations including ELA and EEA in Europe, PALEA in the Asia Pacific region, VFA—
VDMA in Germany, CEA in China and NEII in North America. Our excellence in delivery performance is
another key factor to our market leadership. Elevators must typically be installed within a period of a few hours
on a specific date that is determined on short notice. As a result, a supplier’s timely delivery is critical to the
installer’s ability to complete the installation of the elevator within the specified time and on budget.

**OUR BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are the world’s leading independent elevator components manufacturer. The elevator components
industry is characterized by long-term growth and resilience during economic downturns due to a number of
favorable factors. Demand for elevators has grown significantly faster than GDP due to a number of favorable
global trends, such as population growth, urbanization, taller buildings, aging populations, increased wealth and
increased regulation and safety awareness. As a manufacturer of elevator components operating independently
from elevator installers, we also benefit from the trend of elevator installers increasingly seeking to outsource the
manufacture of components, which has increased the rate of growth for elevator components manufacturers
above the growth in demand for elevators. Our position as the leading independent elevator components
manufacturer has enabled us to capitalize on these growth trends, as evidenced by our strong long-term revenue
growth and EBITDA margins in excess of 10% on average since 2004.

We are a global manufacturer of elevator components with a strong footprint across multiple regions. We
divide our operations into three geographical regions which include Europe, Asia and the Rest of the World. Our
Europe region includes our operations in Africa and represents our core market, accounting for 48.6% of our
revenue in the year ended December 31, 2013, with upside potential as Southern European economies recover.
Our Asia region provides the growth engine for our business, with 37.4% of our revenue, driven by increased
urbanization and other favorable trends in China, and with the potential to grow spare parts sales in China as the
market matures. Our Rest of the World region primarily includes Eurasia, Turkey, the Middle East and Latin
America and represented 13.9% of our revenue, with the potential for significant future growth.

Our product offering features a large range of elevator components for new elevator manufacturing and
sourcing, for spare parts and for modernization and upgrades. Our components span from sophisticated
mechatronic components for elevator cabin and landing doors (including the associated opening mechanisms) to
other critical components such as gearless drives, slings, safety gears and cars. We also offer complete elevators,
which we primarily sell to independent elevator installers (“Independents”). Sales of doors and door
components accounted for 69% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2013. Doors and door
components are required at each floor of a building, so as the average height of new buildings increases, the
demand for elevator doors and door components also increases at a faster rate than demand for other components.
Doors and door components range from relatively standardized, high-volume production doors to highly
customized, special-order doors—we offer 19 models of landing doors and 15 models of elevator car doors.
Having produced approximately 1.2 million doors and door components in the year ended December 31, 2013,
we believe we are the leading elevator door and door components supplier in a highly fragmented elevator
components market.

We manufacture components for both the original equipment market and the aftermarket. We estimate that
the original equipment market makes up a larger percentage of our business in developing countries, such as
China, while the aftermarket makes up approximately 50% of our sales in a mature market such as Europe.
Aftermarket sales range from routine provision of spare parts through the lifetime of an elevator, to components
for modernization and upgrade of an elevator, to complete replacement of an elevator. In developing markets
such as China, we expect aftermarket components sales to strongly increase as the life cycle of newly-installed
elevators progresses.

Our key customers are global, multinational corporation elevator installers (“MNCs”), such as westernbased MNCs Kone, Otis, Schindler and ThyssenKrupp Elevator (“Western MNCs”) and Asian-based MNCs
Fujitec, Hitachi, Hyundai, Mitsubishi Electric and Toshiba (“Asian MNCs”), as well as Independents, which are
typically active in a limited geographic market. In the year ended December 31, 2013, Western MNCs accounted
for approximately 68% of our revenue, Independents for approximately 32% of our revenue and Asian MNCs for
less than 1% of our revenue. We have deeply-ingrained, mutually-dependent relationships with a number of our
key customers, and benefit from multi-year, guaranteed “share-of-wallet” contracts with a number of our key
customers, allowing us to share in the growth of our customers’ business.

In the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we generated revenue of €501.4 million and Historic
Adjusted EBITDA of €72.7 million. As of September 30, 2014, we had a work force of 3,206 employees and
conducted business in more than 50 countries.

**Our Strengths**

We believe our competitive strengths include the following:

**_Leading global position_**

We are the world’s largest independent elevator component manufacturer, with unparalleled breadth and
scale across products and regions. We estimate that we generate more than two times the revenue of our next
largest competitor. We manufacture and sell a broad range of critical and technologically complex components
throughout the world. In contrast, most of our competitors are suppliers that focus on a narrow range of products
and specific regions. Our size and global footprint translate into a number of competitive advantages, including
(i) purchasing power economies of scale, (ii) the capacity to meet our customers’ volume requirements
throughout the world, (iii) the resources to manage complex global safety regulations and certification processes
and to undertake market-leading global research and development, (iv) the ability to deliver globally-consistent,
high levels of quality to our customers and (v) the ability to attract the most skilled talent in our industry.
Because of our leading position, we believe we are often MNCs’ trusted partner of choice for their most complex
projects, including high-visibility projects such as Apple store glass elevators, large hotels and marine facilities,
cruise and cargo ships and offshore oil platforms. Our long and successful track record in projects such as these
provides us with an advantage when our customers are making purchase decisions, thereby allowing us to grow
as the elevator installation industry grows, and to benefit from the same favorable trends.

**_Strong and resilient market dynamics supporting multiple levers of growth_**

The elevator and elevator components market has experienced significant growth, with growth in demand
for elevators estimated to have grown by a CAGR of 9.5% from 1996 to 2012, significantly outpacing global
GDP growth. This has been the result of a number of favorable global trends which we expect to continue,
including population growth, urbanization, taller buildings, aging populations, increased wealth and increased
regulation and safety awareness. Demand for elevator components is driven by new installations, as well as the
need for the modernization and maintenance of the installed base. New installations grow most quickly in
developing markets, such as China, while mature markets, such as those in Europe, have a greater focus on
modernization, maintenance and spare parts. As developing markets mature, we expect the aftermarket for
modernization, maintenance and spare parts in such markets to grow. We also benefit from the trend of
outsourcing, whereby elevator installers choose to outsource the manufacturing of elevator components, which
has increased in recent years, allowing elevator component manufacturers to grow more quickly than demand for
elevators. The elevator components industry lags behind the automotive industry (which itself continues to
increase the rate of outsourcing of components manufacturing) in terms of share of components outsourced, and
we expect the elevator components industry to follow the same trend. These favorable industry trends have
driven our growth.

**_Long-term growth and demonstrated resilience underpinned by a strong financial profile and stable cash_**
**_generation_**

We have achieved strong financial results over the last ten years, combined with resilience during the period
from 2009 to 2010. Our revenue has grown by a CAGR of 7% from 2004 to 2014 and, excluding 2009 to 2010,
we grew our revenues by over 10% per year on average. Our EBITDA margin has exceeded 10% on average in
each year since 2004. Even during the 2009 to 2010 economic downturn our revenues only declined by 10-15%,
and benefiting from our relatively flexible cost structure and capital expenditure profile, we maintained EBITDA
margins in excess of 10% through strict cost management. By 2011, we were able to surpass our pre-crisis level
revenue and EBITDA. Despite weak new housing starts in China in 2014, our business in China continued to
exhibit strong growth throughout the year with a further acceleration in the fourth quarter, and healthy order book
levels for us and our key customers at the end of the year. Our growth over the last ten years has coincided with
that of our Western MNC customers, and they have also experienced margin improvement, underscoring the
overall attractiveness of the industry. We are a highly cash generative business with relatively low levels of
capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the manufacturing industry, and had Cash Conversion
of 82.7% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014. Our global production footprint provides us a natural
hedge against currency, pricing and other local risks. At the same time, we have also maintained consistent
profitability across the regions in which we operate.

**_Strong, long-standing relationships with leading MNCs_**

We are a trusted supplier to the largest international elevator companies in the world. Our largest customers
include many of the world’s most significant elevator companies, such as Kone, Schindler, Otis and

115


-----

ThyssenKrupp Elevator, who together accounted for approximately 43% of total revenue in the elevator industry
in the year ended December 31, 2013. We derived approximately two-thirds of our revenue from these four
customers in the year ended December 31, 2013. We have long-standing relationships with each of these
customers, which we have maintained over the past 15 to 30 years. These long-standing relationships have
allowed us to better understand our customers’ needs and priorities, thereby enabling us to cater to our customers
from conception, design and development to manufacturing and distribution of components to offering
comprehensive after-sale services and technical support. MNCs put substantial efforts in long-term product
standardization in order to simplify and reduce complexity in the maintenance and breakdown service process. In
addition, elevator certification and safety regulations mean that changing components suppliers can add
additional compliance costs. For these reasons, elevator installers prefer to remain with selected components and
suppliers. Doing so reduces failure rates and maintenance cost, improves productivity and minimizes safety risks.
The result has been that our MNC customers engage with us to deliver on their most complex and important
projects, and rely on us as their partner of choice in a manner that would be difficult for a competitor to replicate.
Our close relationships with our key Western MNC customers are also demonstrated by our multi-year
agreements under which our largest customers have agreed to purchase a certain percentage of their requirements
for certain components from us (“share-of-wallet” agreements). We also see an opportunity to expand business
with Asian MNCs, using our close relationships with Western MNCs as a model, particularly as safety
regulations become more stringent in emerging markets to the benefit of established, high-quality component
manufacturers such as us.

**_Strong relationships with Independents_**

We also have strong, long-standing relationships with Independents, who are generally regional elevator
installers. In the year ended December 31, 2013, sales to Independents constituted approximately 32% of our
revenue. Independents accounted for approximately 39% of total revenue in the elevator industry in 2013,
typically require more individualized solutions than MNCs and outsource to a greater degree than MNCs. We
have a full-service offering for Independents that caters to their needs, including offering complete elevators and
spare parts and comprehensive support services for our components. As a result, sales to Independents typically
generate higher gross profit margins than those to MNCs.

**_Serve both the new installation market and the aftermarket_**

We sell elevator components for use in both new elevator installations and for modernizations, upgrades and
maintenance spare parts. The share of our business constituting new installations compared to modernizations,
upgrades and maintenance spare parts varies by region, depending on the age of the installed base of elevators
compared to the pace of new installation. For example, we estimate that new installations constitute
approximately 50% of our sales in mature markets such as Europe, but 90% of our sales in emerging markets,
such as China. Our ability to service both the new installation market and the aftermarket allows us to benefit
from economic growth and emerging markets, while also giving us downside protection and steady sales in
mature markets.

**_Leading research and development platform guided by deep customer and competitor insights_**

Our research and development (“R&D”) teams are supported by leading testing infrastructure, with
dedicated laboratories for doors, drives and safeties. We also systematically analyze competitor products to
improve our own products. Furthermore, existing test towers in Austria, China, Germany and Spain (currently
under construction), also give us a key advantage as an independent component manufacturer. We have seven
R&D centers that focus on performance improvements, weight reduction, energy efficiency, reliability,
maintenance reduction, installation speed and adjustability to new industry norms. We also hold more than 300
patents.

We also cooperate with major universities, providing us access to innovative new technologies at an early
stage. In addition, we have established a close interlink between our R&D department and our product
certification team, thereby ensuring not only a short lead time for required certifications for new product
innovations, but also allowing for quick responses to new regulatory standards. Our R&D work focuses on a
“mechatronic” (the combination of mechanical and electrical engineering) design approach, which enables us to
develop intelligent components with monitoring and diagnostic capabilities, and optimizes installation time. As a
result, the individual life cycle of our components is prolonged, which further supports our customers’
profitability, and therefore their loyalty to us.

**_Experienced and diversified management team with a proven track record for value creation_**

The Wittur Group is led by chief executive officer Dr. Walter Rohregger and chief financial officer
Dr. Daniel Wiest, who are experienced managers with a track record of delivering growth at manufacturing
companies with international operations. Since joining the Wittur team in early 2012, they have developed and
implemented substantial strategic and operational improvements, including rationalization of certain of our
operations, implementation of uniform processes across functional groups, improved management practices,
relocating production to lower-cost jurisdictions and improving internal controls and have coincided with growth
in our revenues and profit margins. They lead a strong senior management team of six regional and functional
managers with a collective 39 years of experience in the industry. Following completion of the Acquisition, we
also expect to benefit from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of our future
shareholder, Bain Capital.

**Our Strategy**

Our management has formulated a comprehensive strategy covering all regions and functions that we
believe will drive growth and align the entire organization to be in a position to exploit the existing market
opportunities:

**_Benefit from group-wide continuous improvement_**

We intend to grow our business, improve our margins, and strengthen relationships with our customers by
continuously improving all aspects of our business. During the last two-and-a-half years, under the leadership of
our management team, we have begun implementing processes throughout our organization in an effort to drive
such continuous improvement. Some of the most significant operational improvements include rationalization of
certain of our operations, relocating production to lower-cost jurisdictions and improving internal controls. But
we are also taking more extensive improvements that reach deep into our organization, and cover all relevant
functions, from sales to purchasing, production, R&D and also include support functions such as finance and
human resources. Through these improvements, we have incentivized individual management to drive growth.
We believe the improvements achieved through these new processes are significant, particularly in relation to
production processes. Our production process improvements focus on improving our quality management
systems and achieving our zero accidents objective. We also are working to improve our delivery performance
and improve the quality of the suppliers from which we source materials. We intend to improve our key account
outreach and sales with Asian MNCs, and we also intend to continue to update and modernize our product range.
We are also focused on optimizing our electronic integration with our key account management teams. This
includes improving our tracking system to enable our customers to track the status of the production process.

**_Continue to grow with the industry and our MNC customers_**

We work closely with our key account MNC customers, and are in constant contact with them to increase
our business with them and benefit from upcoming outsourcing decisions. This close relationship means that as
our MNC customers grow, we plan to grow as well. In particular, we intend to grow with Kone, but also to
continue to diversify our customer base by further developing our relationships with other MNCs. For example,
we recently entered into binding, multi-year “share-of-wallet” agreements with Schindler, as well as with Kone.
We are also in active dialogue with other MNCs, including Asian MNCs, who have historically outsourced less
of their elevator components demand than Western MNCs, and intend to more substantially diversify our
customer mix by developing relationships with other Western MNCs. Over the past twelve months, we have
received an increasing number of requests for quotes for new business from Asian MNCs, validating this
strategy. As part of our continuous improvement strategy, we have focused on optimizing our key account
management teams and strengthening our regional sales teams across all regions and have prioritized R&D to
develop our available products and retain our competitive position in the market.

**_Grow with Independents_**

Our business with Independents represents our second main source of revenue after sales to MNCs. We see
potential to grow our business with Independents, and are working to improve our sales forces’ focus on such
customers. We focus on sales of spare parts via a business-to-business platform to grow our business with
Independents. We believe that increasing regulatory requirements, particularly in developing markets, will enable
us to grow our business with Independents who typically require fully certified packages or complete elevators,
and that Independents will increasingly seek out established, high-quality component manufacturers such as

117


-----

ourselves to help them meet more stringent requirements. We also believe that a focus on Independents will help
us continue our geographic expansion.

**_Further geographic expansion_**

We believe that significant opportunities for our business exist in certain developing markets where we have
not historically focused our operations. In particular, we see opportunities in Eurasia, Latin America and India
and Southeast Asia. In Eurasia, which made up approximately 5% of all new elevator installations in 2013, we
intend to grow in line with the rapidly-growing market by winning business with the MNCs and further
penetrating Independents. In Latin America, we intend to grow our business on the back of strong end market
growth and to benefit from our new plant in Brazil. In India, which made up approximately 5% of all new
elevator installations in 2013, and in Southeast Asia, we see attractive, growth driven end-markets for elevator
components, and the opportunity to sell to both MNCs and Independents operating in those markets. Our view is
that these markets are on the cusp of a strong phase of growth in demand for elevators, akin to that in China in
recent years. To exploit these opportunities, we have increased our sales forces in these regions and are working
to increase local market penetration, so we already have a strong base by which we will be able to quickly
respond to growing demand. We also intend to continue to utilize our strategy of locating our plants in low cost
countries where we benefit from labor cost efficiencies and close proximity to customers. We also are
investigating entry into the North American market. While we expect most of our growth to be organic, we may
also opportunistically undertake accretive acquisitions in the highly fragmented elevator components market.

**_Increase focus on modernization, maintenance and spare parts aftermarket_**

We see the potential for increased sales in the modernization, maintenance and spare parts aftermarket,
particularly in developing markets, such as China. At present, approximately 90% of our sales in emerging
markets are for new elevator installations. However, as the lifecycles of the elevators installed in these markets in
recent years progress over time, we expect demand for modernization, maintenance and spare parts to grow to be
similar to those in more mature markets, such as Europe, where sales of components for modernization,
maintenance and spare parts constitute approximately 50% of our sales.

**_Increase focus on new products and modernization_**

Our R&D and product development is focused on five core initiatives: (i) improving product range
completion (for example., decreasing the weight and installation time of our products); (ii) upgrading existing
best-seller-products such as our drives and slings; (iii) localization of certain products in emerging markets (for
example, introducing our existing product base and adapting it based on local requirements); (iv) improving
existing technology (such as optimizing the product range for drives and reducing their complexity); and
(v) developing new technology (for example, developing complete elevators and expanding our product range,
such as furthering new safety gears to avoid uncontrolled car movements). Our customers drive our focus and
structure the process of product development. For example, we aim to continuously modernize our products
based on customer feedback, such as minimizing energy consumption and eco-efficiency, as our customers
indicate a demand for such features.

**Our History**

We were founded in 1968 by Horst Wittur in Wiedenzhausen (Bavaria, Germany) as a manufacturer and
distributor of elevator swing doors and as a trader of elevator components focusing on the local market. Since
then, we have continuously expanded our product portfolio and production footprint, both organically and
through acquisitions (mainly by way of outsourcing transactions, such as recently taking over the Scheibbs,
Austria, facility from Kone in 2000). We have been early entrants into a number of emerging markets with local
production, such as Turkey (1993), China (1995), Argentina and Brazil (both 2000), Slovakia (2009) and India
(2010). Today, we believe we are the largest independent manufacturer of elevator components, modules and
complete elevators with an extensive global manufacturing footprint and sales network as well as a broad range
of products.

**Our Products**

We produce elevator cabin and landing doors (including door operators) and offer a wide range of gearless
drives, slings, safety gears and cars, while also offering complete elevators. Our in-house product portfolio
covers the vast majority of critical and technologically complex components necessary for elevator installation,
modernization and maintenance.

Doors (including door operators and other door components) have historically been our core product. Doors
and door components accounted for 69% of our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2014.

We supply customers across all market segments with solutions ranging from standardized doors to highly
customized, bespoke door applications with different combinations of performance and technical functionality.
As of September 30, 2014, our door product range included 19 different models of landing doors and 15 different
models of car doors, available for all applications and geographies. Different models are designed to
accommodate distinctive customer needs in terms of traffic flows and sizes (including different speeds, as well as
traffic flows and elevator loads ranging from 250 kilograms to 10,000 kilograms). Standard installations are
available for residential buildings and modernization projects, while a broad set of customizations is available to
meet specific customer demands.

Doors are the leading reason for unscheduled maintenance calls, accounting for what one of our customers
has estimated to be 40% of maintenance activities. Given elevator installers’ focus on service, high reliability and
a low degree of maintenance are key to elevator installers’ ability to differentiate themselves from their
competitors. This factor benefits our business due to our focus on high quality and reliability. Moreover, despite
their relevance to maintenance costs, doors only account for between 14% and 21% of the total cost of an
elevator, so elevator installers may be less likely to compromise quality over price.

Our latest products in the doors-product group comply with European standard EN81 20/50, which is the
most relevant standard for elevators in Europe. Production and installation are based on the “modular” concept,
which optimizes the number of parts and installation time. See “Regulatory Matters.”

**_Slings and Counterweight Frames_**

Slings have historically been one of our other core products. Slings and counterweight frames accounted for
8% of our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. A sling (also known as car sling) is the
supporting frame of the elevator car, to which the guide shoes, safety gear and hoisting ropes or hydraulic
cylinder are attached.

119


-----

We offer a broad range of car and counterweight slings for diverse applications combining different features
for load and technical functionality (these include standard and cantilever slings). In addition, we offer a range of
accessories, including safety gears, suspension pulleys, compensation chains and traveling cable hangers,
allowing configurations suitable for different shaft layouts, elevator designs and speeds. Our product offering
ranges from standard to highly customized high-end slings and special application slings.

The majority of our products in this product group comply with European standard EN81-20/50. We expect
the remaining products will be conformed by the Interlift 2015 fair, scheduled for in October 2015. See
“Regulatory Matters.”

**_Drives_**
Our product offering also includes standardized and customized gearless drives. Drives accounted for 5% of
our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2014.

Our drives have a wide range of potential purposes, including for loads ranging from 275 kilograms to 5,500
kilograms and for speeds from 0.5 meters per second to 5.0 meters per second. We focus on high efficiency
(lower energy consumption) products and high suspension load with our gearless drive range (which limits
backlash, vibration and noise).

**_Safety Gears_**
We supply high speed safety gears and offer a complete product range of safety equipment, including safety
gears and overspeed governors suitable for all common guide types. Safety gears, overspeed governors and safety
brakes accounted for 4% of our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2014.

Our product range includes uni- and bi-directional safety gears and instantaneous and progressive safety
gears. All types of applications are covered with a number of combinations for load, speed, travelling height,
technical functionality, electronic overspeed detection and bi-directional features.

**_Cars_**
We offer a broad selection of cars, both for passenger and goods transportation, with applications from
residential and commercial buildings to specialized industrial applications, and with capacities from 320
kilograms to 5,000 kilograms. Cars accounted for 2% of our revenue in the nine months ended September 30,
2014.

Our cars are integrated with complete elevators, have flexible configuration(s) and are easy to install. We
offer a wide variety of cars with different possible combinations of load, usage, category, accessories and a
number of entrances.

**_Complete Elevator_**
We offer complete elevator packages for Independents. Complete elevators accounted for 5% of our revenue
in the nine months ended September 30, 2014.

MNCs also rely on our complete elevators for certain specialized applications. Our offering includes
modular elevators, bearing loads from 320 kilograms up to 10,000 kilograms. Our broad product offering
includes standard and high performance applications with a large number of customizations from technical
functionality, end-use (home, commercial and high rise elevators), speed and load levels.

For complete elevators, we source certain elements from third parties (e.g., guide rails, controllers,
counterweight fillers) and sell them together as part of the entire system or, in some cases, we sell complete
elevators directly as a distributor.

**Our Regions**
We divide our operations into three geographical regions, which include Europe, Asia and the Rest of the
World. We measure output from our regions on the basis of origination of our products, not their destination.

**_Europe_**
Our Europe region includes our operations in Africa and represents our core market, accounting for 48.6%
of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2013. We also believe our business in Europe has upside potential
as Southern European economies recover. Our operations in Europe are characterized by a mature installed
elevator base, with our sales approximately evenly split between new installations, on the one hand, and
upgrades, modernizations, maintenance and spare parts, on the other hand. For the year ended December 31,
2013, we generated 62% of our revenue in our Europe region through sales to our MNC customers, with 51% of
our revenue derived from sales of doors and door components. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Our geographic regions—Europe.”

120


-----

**_Asia_**

Our Asia region provides the growth engine for our business, and represented 37.4% of our revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2013. This growth is driven by increased urbanization and other favorable trends in
China, with the potential to grow spare parts sales in China as the market there matures. For the year ended
December 31, 2013, we generated 93% of the revenue in our Asia region from our operations in China, with
significant sales in India and South Korea as well. Our Asia business is characterized by provision of components
in connection with new elevator installation, and close cooperation with market-leading Western MNCs active in
China. In the year ended December 31, 2013, we generated 92% of our revenue in our Asia region through sales
to our MNC customers, and doors and door components accounted for 93% of our sales in Asia. See also
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Our geographic
regions—Asia.”

**_Rest of the World_**

Our Rest of the World region primarily includes Eurasia, Turkey, the Middle East and Latin America, and
represented 13.9% of our revenue, with the potential for significant future growth. Business in our Rest of the
World region is primarily based on new elevator installations, except for in Russia, where a significant
component involves elevator modernization and maintenance. Most of our customers in our Rest of the World
region are Independents, who made up 79% of our revenue in our Rest of the World region in the year ended
December 31, 2013. Our product mix is less reliant on doors and door components, which for the year ended
December 31, 2013, made up 22% of our sales in our Rest of the World Region. See also “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Our geographic regions—Rest of the
World.”

**Our Customers**

Our key customers are MNCs, including both Western MNCs and Asian MNCs. Our largest customers are
Kone, Schindler, Otis and ThyssenKrupp Elevator. We also serve Independents, which are typically active in a
limited geographic market.

**Western MNCs**

Our largest customers, the Western MNCs Kone, Schindler, Otis and ThyssenKrupp Elevator accounted for
approximately two-thirds of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2013. We believe that Western MNCs
accounted for approximately 43% of total revenue in the elevator industry in 2013. We manage these key
customers through dedicated key account managers. Our close monitoring and management of our key customers
enables us to meet their high expectations for quality and production process execution. During the past five
years, we have negotiated framework contracts and supply agreements with Kone, Schindler and ThyssenKrupp
Elevator, which typically run for a term of three years. We believe that through our quick response time and high
quality of service we are able to meet our key customers’ high expectations in part due to global presence, which
allows us to provide services and supplies on a local level. This global presence, combined with the engineering,
quality and sales leadership that we offer, we are able to meet the market demands of our MNC customers.

Some of our contracts include “share-of-wallet” volume share undertakings with a term until 2016. These
contracts constitute legal commitments by our customers to guarantee a minimum “share-of-wallet” for their
product requirements to us, meaning that we provide a specified percentage of all of their requirements for
certain specified products. Pursuant to these agreements, MNCs typically share their order intake and production
forecasts with us, which improves the visibility on future volumes in the short and medium term.

Services are the most profitable part of elevator installers’ business and, as a result, the reliability of
components is key to their profitability. Elevator installers enter into service and maintenance agreements with
their customers when they newly install elevators or modernize existing elevators. These agreements typically
take one of two forms, depending on whether the customer opts for a standard or premium service agreement.
The standard type of service agreement is an all-inclusive contract pursuant to which the customer pays a fixed
fee for inspection, maintenance and repair, minus penalties for any periods during which the elevator experiences
downtime. The premium service agreement likewise provides for a fixed fee for periodic inspections but the
elevator installer can additionally claim an hourly rate and materials costs for repairs, plus a mark-up on these
costs. As a result, both types of service agreement incentivize elevator installers to use high quality, premium
components to maximize their profits, due to the all-in fee under the standard contract and the cost mark-up

121


-----

under the premium contract. The penalties for downtime further increase the installer’s incentive to use high
quality components because its all-in fee gets reduced as a function of the length and frequency of downtime,
both of which can be minimized through the use of higher quality components. Due to these penalties elevator
installers also attach high value to their suppliers’ ability to delivery components quickly and reliably. This
further benefits our business because we believe our delivery times are among the best in our industry.

In addition, we believe that MNCs benefit from limiting their suppliers, which benefits our position as an
established and trusted supplier. We estimate that MNCs typically take approximately eight months to enter into
a relationship with a new supplier, taking into account the process of searching for eligible suppliers, evaluating
competitors, contract negotiation and the qualification of that supplier’s specific components and maintenance
manuals. By contrast, MNCs can create important efficiencies by building long-standing relationships with a
select few trusted suppliers. These efficiently include greater economies of scale in training of suppliers, simpler
servicing due to a higher degree of product standardization and guaranteed capacity at their suppliers for their
requirements due to long-term contracts. We believe that these reasons account, in part, for our long-standing
relationship with all our key MNCs.

We have had a relationship with Kone for more than 15 years, and our relationships with Schindler, Otis and
ThyssenKrupp Elevator date back to the 1980s. Our long-standing relationships with our key customers and our
collaborative work with them throughout the value chain from the conception, design, development,
manufacturing and distribution of products to offering a comprehensive portfolio of after-sale services and
technical support have allowed us to develop a deep understanding of our customers’ needs, as well as the
experience to supply appropriate solutions.

We believe that our reputation, based on years of quality, delivery and cost performance, is a key factor in
the success of our business, and therefore we keep the development of new and exclusive products confidential,
reinforcing our commercial ties with our customers and allowing us to work with customers competing in the
same market segment simultaneously.

**_Independents_**

In the year ended December 31, 2013, we generated approximately 32% of our revenue from Independents.
We believe that Independents accounted for approximately 39% of total revenue in the elevator industry in 2013.
As opposed to our larger customers, Independents are typically interested in acquiring packages or complete
elevators, given the increasing complexity and related challenges in meeting elevator industry norms and
requirements. Independents usually require individualized solutions. They place a large emphasis on the solution
as opposed to the technology that stands behind it. As a result, we offer support in the various relevant local
languages for engineering and order processing through our local sales managers. Our full service offering to
Independents includes commissioning of parts in our warehouses.

**_Asian MNCs_**

In the year ended December 31, 2013, we generated approximately 1% of our global revenue from Asian
MNCs, such as Toshiba, Mitsubishi Electric, Fujitec, Hitachi and Hyundai Elevator Co., Ltd. We believe that
Asian MNCs accounted for approximately 18% of total sales in the elevator industry in 2013. We have not yet
captured a significant share of the Asian MNC market because we first focused on the quality of our Asian
products. However, we have recently increased our sales efforts and now have several volume or share
agreements under negotiation with Asian MNCs. In line with our approach to our Western MNCs, we also
manage our Asian MNCs via dedicated key accounts.

**Material Agreements with Customers**

We have entered into a number of contracts and other agreements with our key elevator installation
customers to provide our products to them. The terms of these agreements are commercially highly sensitive.
Below we describe our contractual and order relationships with the four major Western MNCs, which are our
largest customers and account and together account for approximately two-thirds of our revenues.

**_Agreements with Customer 1_**

We recently entered into a series of agreements with Customer 1, including a new framework supply
agreement. This framework agreement stipulates the terms by which we supply our components to Customer 1,

122


-----

including warranty provisions and a spare parts purchase program that survives the term of this framework
agreement. The agreement has a fixed term that runs until December 31, 2016. Thereafter, the agreement is
automatically renewed on an annual basis, unless terminated by either party with 180 days’ prior notice. We have
also entered into “share-of-wallet” agreements with Customer 1 in respect of Customer 1’s requirements for
certain components in certain regions, which run for a three-year period from 2014 to 2016. In addition, we have
also entered into two product development agreements with Customer 1 that require Customer 1 to source
components developed under the product development agreements exclusively from us for a three-year period
following initial delivery. Customer 1 has also granted us a license to use certain of its intellectual property in
connection with the manufacturing of components sold to it. We also have an agreement in place to jointly
develop and improve components with Customer 1. The framework supply agreement and the product
development agreements contain change of control termination provisions, which will allow Customer 1 to
terminate the agreements upon consummation of the Transactions. However, we believe that given the economic
benefit and mutual incentives of the agreement, the risk of termination is low. Customer 1 is our largest customer
upon whom we are substantially dependent.

**_Supply Agreement with Customer 2_**

We have entered into a supply agreement with Customer 2 for the manufacture and supply of automatic
landing and car doors and other elevator components. This agreement stipulates the general terms for supply,
including the specifications of the products, payment and delivery terms and terms regarding the delivery of
spare parts. This agreement was amended to provide for delivery of our components in the Asia region, and to
include a specific “share-of-wallet” purchase obligation for the years 2013 to 2016. The initial term of this
agreement runs for three years, to December 31, 2016. The agreement is automatically renewed on an annual
basis for subsequent one-year periods, unless earlier terminated by either party upon twelve months’ prior notice.
The agreement also contains a change of control termination provision, which will allow Customer 2 to terminate
the agreement upon consummation of the Transactions. However, we believe that given the economic benefit and
mutual incentives of the agreement, the risk of termination is low. While Customer 2 is not our largest customer,
it represents a growing portion of our sales and, as such, we are also dependent on it to a significant degree.

**_Arrangements with Customer 3_**

We do not have a formal framework agreement with Customer 3, but instead supply this customer on an
individual order basis. We have also agreed to adhere to this customer’s code of conduct and global supplier
manual.

**_Arrangements with Customer 4_**

We do not have a formal framework agreement with Customer 4, but instead supply this customer on an
individual order basis. Most of our orders for this customer are project-based. We are currently negotiating the
terms of a global supply agreement with this customer. We have also entered into a number of local supply
agreements with certain subsidiaries of Customer 4, which typically include fixed prices, no minimum purchase
volumes, a penalty for delayed or defective delivery, a modified warranty scheme and limitations on our liability.

**_Sales and Marketing_**

The organization and size of our sales force has been significantly upgraded in the last two years aimed at
building a strong foundation for the future. Key upgrades include:

    - improved coverage and local support in local markets, such as China, India and the rest of Asia, by
hiring 28 additional people;

    - addressing local customer requirements through local engineering support for customized solutions and
service in local language;

    - “Wittur Academy” established as an ongoing effort to train our sales force on products, regulations and
other relevant topics;

    - harmonized central pricing and discount approach across different countries;

    - technological support of our sales force with new iPad-based WEST tool, which allows real-time
quoting at the customer site; and

    - regular follow-ups at short intervals with local sales leaders to track number of customer visits, order
activity and sales force effectiveness, including success of cross selling.

123

**_MNCs_**

As of September 30, 2014, we had eleven key account managers specifically focused on MNCs. In the past
24 months, we have established three new key account functions and have hired further staff to expand our sales
and marketing coverage to previously not closely-covered Western MNCs as well as Asian MNCs.

**_Independents_**

We are present in all significant geographic regions other than North America, with our own sales force
(110 employees as of September 30, 2014) supported by the local production facilities as well as trading
companies and offices. Our sales force provides local support across all regions directed specifically at
Independents. Independents demand more modules and complete elevators with a higher level of complexity and
requirements for local certifications compared to our MNC customers.

**Employees**

The following tables set forth our headcount by region and function, respectively, as of December 31, 2011,
2012 and 2013 and as of September 30, 2013 and 2014:

(*) Employee figures are headcount figures (including temporary workers in 2011 and 2012). Employee figures are based on the annual
average for 2011, but on the number at period-end for all other periods presented.

There is no central works council for the entire Group. However, many of our employees are represented by
works councils, particularly in Austria, Italy and Germany (at our operations in Dresden). We consider our
relations with employees, works councils and unions to be satisfactory.

We provide pension plans to certain employees based on a company agreement under which pension
commitments are granted in compliance with the regulations of Austria, Italy and the German pension fund of the
German government and the German states (Versorgungsanstalt des Bundes und der Länder). In addition, we
have pension commitments towards former managing directors and their relatives. As of September 30, 2014,
these pension obligations amounted to €9.7 million. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Pension Obligations.”

**Our Suppliers**

Our top ten suppliers are based in China and Austria, respectively. We typically enter into framework
agreements with each of our suppliers. These agreements provide for an initial term of one year and are
subsequently automatically renewed for additional one year terms, unless earlier terminated. As a general rule,
either party can terminate our supply agreements subject to 90 days’ prior notice. Our suppliers usually provide

124


-----

payment terms requiring payment within 90 days. The warranty period under our supply agreements, in most
cases, three years from delivery. Our supply agreements typically provide that the parties may renegotiate and
adjust the price payable under the agreement, if a material change in the price of raw materials occurs. See
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors
Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Steel Prices and Our Ability to Pass on Cost Increases
to Our Customers.”

**Information Technology**

Our most commonly used Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system is Baan, which is running in the
following key countries: Turkey, Italy, Spain and China. We recently have established LucaNet as our central
controlling and finance tool. We are currently in the process of rolling out a global standardized ERP system
(“Infor-LN”) to our regions and subsidiaries. Infor-LN will allow steering of trading units, sales and plants. In
addition, our new customer relationship management (“CRM”) tool ‘WEST’ (CRM & product configurator) has
been rolled-out as a pilot in Europe in 2014 and other regions will follow in 2015 and 2016.

**Intellectual Property**

**_Trademarks and Domains_**

As of September 30, 2014, we held 29 locally-protected trademarks, 18 of which were considered strategic.
“Wittur” and “5 triangles” are the two main trademarks and they are registered in more than 80 countries around
the world. The most recently registered trademark “Safety in motion” is protected in the European Union as well
as in all the other countries where we have production plants or trading companies. We also registered our
trademark “wittur” under various country code top-level domains in more than 20 countries worldwide and under
the generic top-level domains “.org,” “.biz” and “.info.”

**_Patents_**

As of September 30, 2014, we owned 76 inventions (patents or utility models) locally protected in 13
countries for a total of more than 300 local patents and utility models. The protected inventions are divided into
five categories: System (seven patents), Cars (three patents), Doors (46 patents), Safety devices (12 patents) and
Electric Drives (six patents). Thirty-nine of these patents are considered of high importance to us.

During the year ended 2013, we registered three utility models and as of September 30, 2014, we had filed
one patent and three utility models.

**_Licenses_**

As of September 30, 2014, we granted one exclusive know-how license regarding non-patented know-how
in connection with our electric drives to a third party. We also have granted two non-exclusive patent licenses to
a third party and received in turn two non-exclusive patent licenses from this party with regard to elevators with
traction sheaves. We have also entered into a global license agreement with the trading companies within our
group for the use of the trademarks “Wittur” and “5 triangles.”

**Property, Plant and Equipment**

Our headquarters are situated in Wiedenzhausen, Germany. We fully own the building and area immediately
surrounding the building with a surface area of 17,275 square meters.

As of September 30, 2014, we operated ten strategically-located production plants on three continents. We
believe our global production platform allows us to maximize cost competitiveness, shorten lead times and limit
transportation costs and import duties, while giving us close proximity to customers and enabling us to provide
local support. Of our ten plants, five are located in Europe, one in Eurasia, one in China, one in India and two in
Latin America.

Construction of our plant in Krupina, Slovakia was completed in 2009 and, since then, we have gradually
expanded its capacity.

The following table provides an overview of our ten plants, four trading buildings (office or warehouses)
and sole building held for sale in order of the total size of the property.

**Research & Development**

As of September 30, 2014, our R&D team consisted of 75 engineers working in each of our regions,
including in emerging markets. We closely cooperate with our core MNC customers on new product
developments, benefiting from our in-house R&D and product testing facilities. In the nine months ended
September 30, 2014, we spent €6.3 million on R&D, of which €1.6 million was capitalized. In 2013, we spent
€7.6 million on R&D, of which €1.8 million was capitalized.

In 2013, we increased our focus on R&D and introduced both a new global R&D unit and a new global
R&D director to improve product development focus, better coordinate resources and global know-how and
eliminate duplicative work. Our teams are supported by leading testing infrastructure, with dedicated laboratories
for doors, drives and safeties. We also systematically analyze competitor products to improve our own products.
Furthermore, existing test towers in Austria, China, Germany and Spain (currently under construction), also give
us a key advantage as an independent component manufacturer. We have eight R&D centers that focus on
performance improvements, weight reduction, energy efficiency, reliability, maintenance reduction, installation
speed and adjustability to new industry norms and regulations. We also hold more than 300 patents.

We have a network focused on global cooperation with major universities that gives us access to innovative
new technologies at an early stage. In addition, we have established a close interlink between our R&D
department and our product certification team, thereby ensuring not only a short lead time for required
certifications for new product innovations, but also allowing for very quick responses to new regulatory
standards. Our R&D work focuses on a “mechatronic” (the combination of mechanical and electrical
engineering) design approach, which enables us to develop intelligent components with monitoring and
diagnostic capabilities, and optimizes installation time. As a result, the individual life cycle of our components is
prolonged, which further supports our customers’ profitability, and therefore their loyalty to us.

In addition, we believe global safety standards in the elevator components industry are rising, and we are
well-positioned to anticipate and swiftly adopt new standards and safety certification requirements. This is due to
our representation on all key standard-setting organizations, including ELA and EEA in Europe, PALEA in the
Asia Pacific region, VFA—VDMA in Germany, CEA in China and NEII in North America.

**Environmental Matters**

Our sites are subject to international, national and local environmental laws and regulations. We are
currently in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental, health and safety regulations. These laws
and regulations are constantly changing, however, as are the priorities of those who enforce them. We believe we
are currently not required to perform any material remedial actions under any applicable environmental laws, nor
do we anticipate any material expenses for such actions in the foreseeable future. See “Risk Factors—Legal,
Taxation and Environmental Risks—We are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the many jurisdictions
in which we operate, and we may be adversely affected by changes regarding applicable legal and regulatory
requirements” and “Regulatory Matters.”

**Insurance**

We have taken out industry-standard insurance coverage under liability and property/business interruption
insurance policies. All of our policies are underwritten by reputable insurance providers, and we conduct periodic
reviews of our insurance coverage, both in terms of coverage limits and deductibles. We also actively monitor all
key conditions under our policies and have systems in place to ensure that we remain in compliance with those
conditions. We believe that our insurance coverage is sufficient for the risks associated with our operations.

For the benefit of our directors and officers, we have entered into a global directors and officers (“D&O”)
insurance policy with three co-insurers based in Germany and England. The policy covers our present, former
and future directors and officers, general managers, authorized officers and senior staff. It applies globally and
provides for an insured limit of €10.0 million per claim and per year. The D&O insurance covers financial losses
due to wrongful acts in respect of claims filed against the insured persons in writing, as well as the defense of
liability claims and their settlement. The insurance coverage does not extend to claims due to certain deliberate
acts by the insurees and there is no insurance cover for contractual penalties, fines or punitive or exemplary
damages, to the extent insurance is prohibited by law.

**Legal Proceedings**

We become involved from time to time in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our
business, such as personal liability claims, employee claims, disputes with our suppliers or authorities and
intellectual property disputes. For example, we are currently litigating a claim brought by one of our customers in
relation to a product manufactured by our subsidiary Wittur Electric Drives GmbH. Our customer asserts that
servo motors produced and delivered by Wittur Electric Drives GmbH failed to comply with certain quality
requirements and claims damages of approximately €1.2 million. However, we are currently not involved in any
legal proceedings which, either individually or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse effect on
our financial position or results of operations. We note, however, that the outcome of legal proceedings can be
extremely difficult to predict, and we offer no assurances in this regard.

127


-----

**REGULATORY MATTERS**

Our operations are materially affected by government regulations in the form of international conventions,
national, regional and local laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are manufactured, as
well as in the country or countries of their distribution and installation. Because such conventions, laws and
regulations are constantly subject to revision, it is not possible to predict the continuing costs of compliance with
such conventions, laws and regulations and the impact thereof on our business operations. Additional laws and
regulations, environmental, security related or otherwise, may be adopted and could increase our costs. See “Risk
Factors—Legal, Taxation and Environmental Risks—We are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the
many jurisdictions in which we operate, and we may be adversely affected by changes regarding applicable legal
and regulatory requirements” The following explanations are limited to the most significant conventions, laws
and regulations which might be important for our business operations, i.e. those in the European Union
(including Germany) and China, as these jurisdictions have a great impact on our business.

**Permits, Licenses and Certificates**

We are required to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our operations. Permits
vary according to the underlying national regulations, but typically include business, operating and
manufacturing licenses, emissions, waste, water and waste water permits as well as specific building permissions.
The kinds of permits, licenses and certificates required for the manufacturing, distribution and storage operations
and sites for lift components will depend upon a number of factors. Subject to the discussion in this section, we
believe that we have been and will continue to be able to obtain all permits, licenses and certificates material to
the conduct of our operations.

**Competition and Trade rules**

**_European Union_**

In the European Union, we are subject to the competition rules, particularly those set forth in Articles 101
and 102 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”). Article 101 TFEU generally prohibits and
declares void any agreement or concerted actions among companies which adversely affect competition, in
particular if they lead to the formation of cartels or anticompetitive foreclosure. The abuse of a dominant position
is prohibited by Article 102 TFEU. These provisions apply to horizontal cooperation (i.e. cooperation between
competitors) as well as to vertical cooperations (i.e. cooperation within the production chain). The forms of
cooperation subject to these provisions can include cooperation agreements, licensing agreements, distribution
agreements or joint ventures. Under specific conditions, certain forms of cooperation are exempted from antitrust
provisions or may be approved upon application if they contribute to improving the production or distribution of
goods or to promoting technical or economic progress, while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting
benefit.

Mergers and acquisitions exceeding a certain threshold are therefore subject to approval by the European
Commission. Failing approval these acquisition agreements are void. Consequently, the Acquisition Agreement
has been submitted to the competent anti-trust authorities. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
Transactions—The Acquisition is subject to significant uncertainties and risks.”

Anti-competitive behavior is subject to fines and penalties.

We are also subject to the state aid rules, particularly those set forth in Articles 107 and 108 TFEU.
Government support granted to the Wittur Group, whether in the form of grants, tax allowances, public loans,
guarantees or any form whatsoever, is considered state aid within the meaning of Articles 107 and 107 TFEU and
must be in compliance with the requirements set forth therein. Where such state aid has been granted in breach of
procedural and/or substantive requirements, this government support is illegal. Any breach of European Union
state aid law may lead to recovery of the sums received. Such recovery may be ordered by the granting authority
itself or by competitors bringing actions for recovery before the national courts.

**_Austria_**

Since we have subsidiaries in Austria, compliance with Austrian competition law is also relevant for us. The
Austrian Cartel Act (Kartellgesetz) sets out largely similar provisions regarding horizontal and vertical
restrictions of competition and abuses of dominance as the EU competition law. Alleged violations are
investigated by the Austrian Federal Competition Authority and/or the Federal Antitrust State Attorney, the
so-called Official Parties. A major difference as compared to other jurisdictions in the EU is that none of the

128


-----

Official Parties has any decision making power—instead they act as a state prosecutor, bringing cases to the
Higher Regional Court of Vienna acting as the Cartel Court (Oberlandesgericht Wien als Kartellgericht). The
Cartel Court then decides whether there has been a breach of the law and issues a fully reasoned decision. The
Official Parties propose a penalty to be imposed; however, it is up to the Cartel Court to decide upon the level of
the penalty. Furthermore, for concentrations which do not fall within the scope of the EU merger control, the
Austrian Cartel Act provides for a merger control regime, the applicability of which depends on meeting certain
worldwide and domestic turnover thresholds. As regards the granting of merger control clearances in phase I, the
decision making power is with the Official Parties.

**_Germany_**

Since our business is build up on a large presence in Germany, German competition legislation may apply to
us as well. However, if applicable, the European Union competition rules have priority over the national
provisions. The German Act against Restraints of Competition (“Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen”—
“GWB”) sets out largely similar restraints on agreements and concerted actions among companies. The
competent authorities are the German Federal Cartel Office and the Federal State cartel authorities.

**_China_**

We are subject to anti-competition regulations in China. The Anti-Monopoly Law of the People’s Republic
of China (“PRC”), which took effect on August 1, 2008, prohibits monopolistic conduct, such as entering into
monopoly agreements, abuse of dominant market position and concentration of undertakings that have or may
have the effect of eliminating or restricting competition.

**_Monopoly Agreement_**

Competing economic operators must not enter into monopoly agreements that eliminate or restrict
competition, for example by boycotting transactions, fixing or changing the price of commodities, limiting the
output of commodities, fixing the price of commodities for resale to third parties, or by other means, unless the
agreement concerned satisfies the criteria for exemptions under the Anti-Monopoly Law, such as improving
technologies or increasing the efficiency and competitiveness of small and medium-sized undertakings.
Monopoly agreements include agreements, decisions and other concerted conducts designed to eliminate or
restrict competition. Sanctions for violations include an order to cease the relevant activities, confiscation of
illegal gains and fines (from 1% to 10% of sales revenue from the previous year, or RMB 500,000 if the intended
monopoly agreement has not been performed).

**_Abuse of Dominant Market Position_**

An economic operator with a dominant market position must not abuse its dominant market position for
certain types of conduct, such as selling commodities at unfairly high prices or buying commodities at unfairly
low prices, selling products at prices below cost without any justifiable cause, and refusing to trade with a trading
party without any justifiable cause. Sanctions for violation of the prohibition on the abuse of dominant market
position include an order to cease the relevant activities, confiscation of the illegal gains and fines (from 1% to
10% of sales revenue from the previous year).

**_Concentration of Undertakings_**

Where a concentration of undertakings reaches the declaration threshold stipulated by the State Council of
the PRC, a declaration must be approved by the anti-monopoly authority before the parties are allowed to
implement the concentration. Concentration refers to (1) a merger of undertakings; (2) acquiring control over
other undertakings by an undertaking through acquiring equities or assets; or (3) acquisition of control over, or
the possibility of exercising decisive influence on, an undertaking by contract or by any other means. If economic
operators fail to comply with the mandatory declaration requirement, the anti-monopoly authority is empowered
to terminate and/or unwind the transaction, dispose of relevant assets, shares or businesses within certain periods
and impose fines of up to RMB 500,000.

**_Foreign Trade Provisions_**

Foreign Trade provisions, in particular export and import control regulations, prohibit or restrict exports and
imports of certain products and trade with sanctioned countries, organizations and persons. Since we operate in
various countries, we may be subject to such restrictions. If we do not comply with those provisions, the
competent authorities may impose fines or sanctions on the Wittur Group and/or the persons involved.

129


-----

As a general rule, the import and export of certain products which may endanger the public safety such as
weapons, certain explosive materials or security-sensitive technologies are permanently subject to approval.
Generally, all other products may be imported and exported without approval as long as Customs provisions are
complied with.

In case economic sanctions are imposed on other countries, trade with those countries is restricted, e.g.,
import and export in toto, or as regards certain economically sensitive products, or regarding economic
relationships with certain organizations or natural persons. Those economic sanctions may be imposed on several
levels.

**_International_**

Economic sanctions on the international level may be imposed by the UN Security Council. Pursuant to Art.
41 Charter of the UN (“UN Charter”), the Security Council may decide which measures not involving the use of
armed force are to be imposed to give effect to its decisions. These measures may include “complete or partial
interruption of economic relations.” The UN Member States are obliged to enforce these measures, Art. 48
(2) UN Charter. The Security Council may determine whether its enforcement measures shall be taken by all or
only by specific UN Member States, Art. 48 (1) UN Charter. The sanctions are issued by UN resolutions and
supervised by Sanction Committees or Working Groups established by the Security Council. The Security
Council publishes and updates the consolidated list of currently enforced economic sanctions.

**_European Union_**

Foreign trade provisions are mainly imposed on EU level as the European Union Treaties include the
Common Commercial Policy which does not leave any further competence in this area to the Member States,
Art. 3 (1) e) TFEU. As a general rule, import and export is not restricted except for certain products for safety,
security of supply or environmental reasons. For instance, dual-use products are subject to Council Regulation
(EC) No 428/2009 of May 5, 2009 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering
and transit of dual-use items (“Dual-Use Regulation”) as last amended by Regulation (EU) No 599/2014.

Apart from the permanent trade control provisions, economic sanctions may be imposed pursuant to Art.
215 TFEU by Council decisions which determine the transactions, products, entities and/or persons affected.
These decisions are in general implemented by Council Regulations which are directly applicable in the Member
States. An updated consolidated list of current sanctions in force is published on the websites of the European
External Action Service (“EEAS”).

**_China_**

Any company engaging in the import and export business must obtain a customs registration certificate
from the General Administration of Customs or its local counterparts and an independent declarant registration
certificate from the Entry & Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau.

Importation of elevator components is subject to the inspection and quarantine procedures required by the
Entry & Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau or its local counterparts and the customs clearance procedures
with the General Administration of Customs or its local counterparts, and the importer shall pay importation
tariffs and value-added tax according to the relevant tariffs and tax rules.

Imported elevator components must comply with applicable technical standards and satisfy the mandatory
testing requirements. If a permit is necessary for the manufacturing and sale of any such elevator component in
China, such permit must be obtained before any imported elevator components can be sold in China.

Elevator components that are imported into or exported out of China must also comply with all other
general commodity import and export inspection laws and regulations.

**Security and Safety Matters**

Security and safety matters are of significant importance to our product offering and operations.

**_Product regulation_**

Our lift components and complete lift systems are subject to various product regulations in the countries
where they are placed on the market or installed. Lift installation is typically also subject to provisions stemming
from building regulations such as minimum shaft widths and safety and fire protection requirements. Those

130


-----

requirements are imposed on the installer of the respective elevator components. As we ourselves do not install
lifts, these requirements do not apply to us. In any case, we are in compliance with the product regulations
mentioned in more detail below with the result that we enable our customers to comply with the related
installation requirements.

**_European Union_**

Within the European Union, the requirements for lifts and lift components are set out in Directive (EC)
No 95/16 of June 29, 1995 (“Lift Directive”) as last amended by Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of October 25, 2012. The Lift Directive provides for essential health and
safety requirements for lifts and safety components for lifts and harmonizes the respective product standards.
Products having passed a conformity assessment with regard to the essential health and safety requirements in
one Member State are marked with the CE-mark applicable in all other Member States unless they present a risk
to the safety of persons or, where appropriate, to property. When applying harmonized standards officially
published by the Commission, there is a presumption of conformity with the essential health and safety
requirements. Although the Lift Directive sets only a minimum standard as regards product requirements, the
Member States are not entitled to provide for stricter technical requirements than those laid down in the Lift
Directive if they require the lifts to be modified in a way not specified by the Lift Directive. However, they may
provide for additional requirements concerning the use of the lift provided there is no impact on the technical
requirements.

The directive had to be transposed into national law (“National Implementing Measures”).

On February 26, 2014 a recast of the Lift directive was adopted. The new Lift Directive sets out specific
obligations for the manufacturer, the distributor and the installer of lifts and lift components. Additionally, the
conformity assessment procedure has been harmonized and is applicable in every Member State. Market
surveillance mechanisms have been strengthened and harmonized. However, it still remains up to the Member
States to implement their own and effective penalty system including fines, administrative and even criminal
sanctions if necessary, in order to deter non-compliance with the essential health and safety requirements as well
as non-compliance with the regime governing the CE marking.

Directive 2014/33/EU on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to lifts and safety
components for lifts has to be transposed into national law by April 19, 2016. Those measures shall apply from
April 20, 2016. On that same day, the current Lift Directive will be repealed.

Escalators, moving walkways as well as stair lifts and lifting devices for the disabled do not fall under the
scope of the Lift Directive. As regards these products, the essential health and safety requirements are set out in
the Directive 2006/42/EC (“Machine Directive”).

The Machine Directive already provides, and the new Lift Directive will provide, for similar procedures as
regards the conformity assessment and the market surveillance mechanisms, as both directives are based on the
so-called New Legislative Framework on Product Safety creating an integrated framework for European Union
Product Regulation applicable to all harmonized products.

Technical specifications providing means of satisfying the aforementioned essential health and safety
requirements are available in harmonized European Standards (issued by the European Committee for
Standardization—“CEN”). Application of the harmonized standards is not mandatory. However, applying the
approved standards justifies the presumption of conformity with the essential health and safety requirements.
Those standards may be adopted as mandatory national standards by the Member States.

**_Austria_**

The Lift Directive was transposed into Austrian law through the Austrian Lift Safety Ordinance
(Aufzügesicherheitenverordnung) and the Austrian Lifting System Operating Ordinance (Hebeanlagen_Betriebsverordnung 2009), whereas the Machine Directive has been implemented in Austria by virtue of the_
Austrian Machine Safety Ordinance (Maschinen-Sicherheitenverordnung 2010). The aforementioned Austrian
ordinances transpose the Lift Directive and Machine Directive in a rather literal way.

**_Germany_**

As the Lift Directive leaves the Member States only a very limited margin for even stricter regulation,
Germany’s transposition of the Lift Directive may be cited as a good example for a fully harmonized legislation.

131


-----

The current Lift Directive is transposed into national law by virtue of the 12th Product Safety Ordinance (Lift
Ordinance) (“Zwölfte Verordnung zum Produktsicherheitsgesetz—Aufzugsverordnung”). The ordinance is
basically limited to a literal application of the European Union Lift Directive. Accordingly, the ordinance only
refers to the conformity assessment procedures provided for in the European Union Lift Directive and its
Annexes. Lift components which are to be installed in a lift may be exempted from conformity assessment if the
manufacturer establishes that the lift itself is in conformity with the Lift Directive’s conformity provisions. Noncompliance with the lift regulation is defined as an administrative offense.

Until now and in light of the transposition period ending in April 2016, neither a modified Lift Ordinance
nor a corresponding Draft has been issued yet. A literal transposition of the requirements and procedures laid
down in the European Union Lift Directive would be sufficient in order to comply with the narrow margin of
regulation left to the Member States. However, the Member States remain free inter alia to increase the penalty
or administrative offense system established for non-compliance with the Lift Directive’s requirements provided
sanctions remain proportionate to the infringements. Thus, it remains unclear whether Germany (or the other
European Union Member States) will transpose the new Lift Directive in a rather literal way or whether their
tendency will be to impose stricter requirements.

**_China_**

_Production Permits_

On January 24, 2009, the State Council of the PRC issued the “Regulations on Safety Supervision over
Special Equipment,” which became effective on May 1, 2009. Specifically, these regulations are designed to
govern certain specialized equipment in the marketplace and outline specific rules and regulations in connection
with their production and safety.

The aforementioned Regulations consider elevator safety components as a kind of “special equipment” and
designate the “General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine” (the “Supervision
**Bureau”) as the supervising entity for the production, use and inspection of such elevator safety components.**
The Supervision Bureau published a “Special Equipment Catalogue.” Many of the products that we produce,
including the elevator drive, speed governor, lift controller, safety gear and door locks are elevator safety
components listed in the Special Equipment Catalogue and thereby subject to the Regulations.

According to the Regulations and certain specific provisions promulgated by the Supervision Bureau, all
elevator safety component manufacturers must obtain a “Special Equipment Manufacturing Permit” from the
China Special Equipment Inspection and Research Institute (the “Research Institute”), which is a subordinate
organization of the Supervision Bureau, in order to produce and sell any elevator safety components.

In order to apply for such permit, the elevator component manufacturers must submit sample equipment
along with its application to the Research Institute for inspection and other analysis. Once the manufacturer and
the respective elevator components pass the examination and are officially recorded in the Research Institute’s
files, the manufacturer is deemed to have obtained the aforementioned special equipment manufacturing permit.
Once the manufacturer obtains such permit, the elevator components that have passed the inspection will be
considered licensed products that are fit for large-scale production and sales in China. It is important to note that
manufacturers that engage in the production of elevator safety components without a valid permit can be assessed
a maximum penalty of RMB 300,000 by the Supervision Bureau. Manufacturing products without such permit
may also be deemed a criminal offense.

We also manufacture other elevator components in China, including elevator cars, car slings and inverters.
In China, such components are not considered “special equipment,” therefore, we are not required to obtain a
special equipment manufacturing permit in order to produce and sell these components in China.

_Maintenance and Repair_

On June 29, 2013, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress promulgated the PRC Special
Equipment Safety Law, which became effective on January 1, 2014. Pursuant to the PRC Special Equipment
Safety Law, complete lift system manufacturers or a commissioned qualified service provider are responsible for
the elevator’s maintenance and repairs. If the complete lift manufacturer is unable to effectively fulfill its
maintenance obligations or commissions an unqualified third party service provider to assist in the elevator’s
maintenance, the complete lift manufacturer will be penalized by the Supervision Bureau.

132


-----

_Technical Standard_

In China, the technical requirements for new elevators include in the “Safety Standard for the Construction
and Installation of Elevators (GB7588-2003)” and its provisions are based on an equivalent European standard,
_i.e., the “Safety Rules for the Construction and Installation of Lifts—Electric lifts. (EN81-1:1998).” Further, the_
technical requirements under GB7588-2003 are equivalent to those under EN81-1:1998. Although GB7588-2003
is intended for complete lifts, many provisions in the standard apply to elevator components as well.

As of now, China has no applicable industry-wide technical standards for a majority of other elevator
components manufactured by us, with the exception of elevator drives, which have a separate national technical
standard titled “Elevator Drives (GB/T 24478-2009).” The elevator components that we manufacture must fulfill
the requirements stated in the above mentioned technical standards.

**Product liability**

**_European Union_**

As regards marketing our products, we are subject to provisions on (civil) product liability and may,
therefore, be held liable in cases of damage caused by a defective product manufactured by us. In the EU,
Directive (EEC) No 85/374 of July 25, 1985, as amended by Directive (EC) No 1999/34 of May 10, 1999
(“Product Liability Directive”) applies to movables which have been industrially produced even if incorporated
into another movable or into an immovable. It establishes the principle of objective liability (liability without
fault of the producer) in cases of damage caused by a defective product. The Directive applies to damage caused
by death or by personal injuries and damage to an item of property intended for private use or consumption,
insofar as damage exceeds EUR 500. The Product Liability Directive does not in any way restrict compensation
for non-material damage under national legislation.

**_Austria_**

The Product Liability Directive has been transposed into Austrian law by virtue of the Austrian Product
Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz). The Austrian Product Liability Act does not contain criminal or
administrative penalties. However, intentional and negligent conduct may lead to a criminal liability (e.g., bodily
injury caused by negligence). The liability regime of the Austrian Product Liability Act covers liability for death,
bodily injury and damage to tangible property (other than the defective product itself) resulting from a defect in a
product. Compensation for the damage of tangible property may only be claimed if it was not used by an
entrepreneur predominantly for his business and compensation may only be claimed for the part exceeding €500.
The scope of compensation of damages to persons is subject to general civil law provisions of the Austrian
General Civil Code (Allgemeines Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch).

**_China_**

The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress amended and restated the PRC Product Quality
Law on July 8, 2000. Under the PRC Product Quality Law, a manufacturer or seller is liable for a design or
manufacturing defect of a product that has been placed on the market, if such defect caused a third party to
sustain any injuries or damages to its person or property.

The word “manufacturers” is not clearly defined under the PRC Product Quality Law. According to the
current interpretation of the PRC Product Quality Law, as of now, it appears that product liability claims can only
be made against those who make, sell or license defective end-products. According to current practices, it
appears Chinese courts generally do not accept claims made by end-users directly against components suppliers
and parts producers. Given that we are an elevator component manufacturer, it appears that a court is unlikely to
admit a claim brought by an end-user against us predicated on the grounds of violation of any PRC product
quality law unless the products are directly sold to the end-users. However, as previously mentioned, complete
lift manufacturers may still claim against component suppliers for any losses arising from any injury or damage
caused by defects in its elevator products on the grounds of breach of warranty obligations.

**Chemicals, Hazardous Substances and Goods**

For our manufacturing activities, we use chemicals and hazardous substances which are subject to specific
regulations on their use and transport in various jurisdictions and on international level. See “Risk Factors—
Legal, Taxation and Environmental Risks—We could incur liabilities under environmental laws and regulations,
including liability for soil, water or groundwater contamination or for risks related to hazardous materials.” See
also below “—Environmental Matters— Contamination” and “—China—Clean-up Obligations.”

133


-----

**_International_**

As regards the transportation of dangerous goods, the European Agreement concerning the International
Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (“ADR”) as of September 30, 1957, as amended on January 1, 2013
includes provisions applicable to the carriage of dangerous goods on roads. Pursuant to the ADR, subject to
compliance with a number of conditions, such as packaging and labelling requirement, dangerous goods may be
carried internationally in road vehicles. Specific dangerous goods (e.g., goods which are poisonous and explosive
at the same time) are excluded from carriage on the road.

**_European Union_**

The EU Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (Regulation
(EC) No. 1907/2006), (“REACH”), as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 317/2014 of March 27,
2014, imposes significant obligations concerning chemical substances. Its main objectives include improving the
protection of human health and the environment from risks that can be posed by chemicals and ensuring the free
circulation of substances within the Internal Market of the EU. Most of the burden for compliance with this
Regulation is borne by the chemical industry. However, this Regulation includes a number of restrictions on the
use of chemicals and requirements for authorization to use certain chemicals which may affect the ability to use
certain substances or make it necessary to use substitutes authorized in the European Union. Further related items
of legislation regulating chemicals or products are not replaced by REACH and continue to apply. REACH also
sets out information and documentation obligations.

**Occupational Health and Safety**

According to national and international provisions, we are obliged to take measures related to health and
safety at work in most jurisdictions. Knowledge of hazardous substances and associated health and safety risks
develops over time as do the related standards do. In this context, we must, for example, perform risk
assessments, maintain registers of hazardous substances and issue working instructions to ensure the safe
handling of hazardous substances and manufacturing equipment by our employees. In general, compliance with
employment safety regulations is subject to regulatory supervision.

**_China_**

The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress amended the PRC Safe Production Law on
August 31, 2014 becoming effective on December 1, 2014, which sets out the legal framework to achieve and
ensure safety in a manufacturer’s production and operation activities. Under the Safe Production Law,
manufacturers are required to establish internal safety systems and regulations and (i) set up internal
organizational structures or (ii) appoint responsible personnel in order to provide working and manufacturing
conditions that strictly comply with industry-wide standards or the safety requirements promulgated by the
relevant PRC authority.

Manufacturers that do not satisfy the facilities and conditions required by law or other industrial standards
are not allowed to start or continue their production or operation activities. Manufacturers are also required to set
up clearly visible safety caution signals at their production or operation sites, facilities or equipment where there
is a material risk to safety and must also provide protective uniforms and personal care products to the relevant
employees for their personal protection.

The PRC Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Occupational Diseases amended and restated as of
December 31, 2011, states that the working environment and conditions provided by employers must meet
certain occupational health standards and other requirements. The law also states that employers must also adopt
and implement measures to ensure that employees have access to occupational health protection systems. The
employers are also obliged to obtain social insurance cover for any work-related injuries as required by law;
additionally, employers engaged in projects that have a hazardous factor causing an occupational disease listed in
the Occupational Diseases Catalogue must declare such activities and be supervised by the relevant work safety
authorities.

**Environmental Matters**

We must comply with a wide range of environmental laws and regulations in various jurisdictions. For
example, we must comply with regulations on emissions control, on the handling of hazardous substances (see
above), water laws, regulations on waste management and packaging waste and on the prevention or clean-up of

134


-----

contamination. We are also subject to various preventive and precautionary measures, for example in
ecologically sensitive areas, flood risk areas and areas known to be contaminated. All the aforementioned
regulations vary from one jurisdiction to another.

Some of the environmental and administrative requirements are specific to our production mechanisms,
such as those set out by emission control legislation, water and waste regulation. Accordingly, permits are based
on figures relating to our production; in particular they depend on the specific conditions at the individual
production sites. Thus, changes in the production system may lead to changes in the assessment of the underlying
permits. Others, such as building law and contamination regulation, relate only to our production sites. In most
countries we are active as a manufacturer, the construction of a plant requires a building or similar permit,
possibly permits under emission control law or similar regulations. Contamination regulation with regard to the
production sites is common as well.

**_Contamination_**

Where the soil or groundwater on our current or former properties is contaminated or such contamination is
suspected, we may be held liable by the authorities See “Risk Factors—Legal, Taxation and Environmental
Risks—We could incur liabilities under environmental laws and regulations, including liability for soil, water or
groundwater contamination or for risks related to hazardous materials.”

National regimes governing liability for contamination of soil and groundwater can include for example,
obligations to investigate, clean-up, remove, reduce or prevent the migration of detected contaminations from our
sites. Authorities may order investigation, remediation or containment measures. Such liabilities regularly affect
the party that caused the contamination (polluter) or the owner of the relevant premises, but national laws may
also provide that further parties, such as the former owner or the party having control of the premises (i.e. the
lessee) can be held (jointly or severally) liable for the often costly remediation measures.

**_Greenhouse Gas Regulation_**

_International_

In February 2005, the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the
“Kyoto Protocol”) entered into force. Pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol, countries which are party to the Protocol
are required to implement national programs to reduce emissions of certain gases, generally referred to as
greenhouse gases. A new global agreement on climate change is expected by 2015, possibly taking effect in
2020. Future amendments to the Kyoto Protocol or a new agreement may increase obligations to reduce emission
of greenhouse gases. Therefore, the regulations on greenhouse gases may be transposed into domestic laws which
may apply to our manufacturing business.

_European Union_

As a general rule, operators are required to hold allowances in order to emit CO2 emissions. One allowance
confers the right to emit the equivalent of one ton of CO2 during a specified allocation period. The competent
authority sets an emissions cap and the total amount of allowances cannot exceed this threshold, limiting the total
emissions of the operator to that level.

More generally, there are several roadmaps, strategies and plans in place at European Union level providing
for the reduction of emissions, an increase of the share of renewable energies or more energy efficiency. In
October 2014, EU Heads of State and Government also reached an agreement on a new climate and energy
framework for 2030. Various objectives have been agreed upon, including a cut in greenhouse gas emissions by
at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, an EU-wide binding target for renewable energy of at least 27%
and an indicative energy efficiency target of at least 27%.

**China**

As regards environmental matters in China, the following aspects should be noted.

**_Regulatory Framework_**

Manufacturers in China are subject to the requirements of PRC environmental laws and regulations on air
emission, waste water discharge, solid waste and noise. The major environmental regulations applicable to
manufacturers include the PRC Environmental Protection Law, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of
Water Pollution and its Implementation Rules, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution, the

135


-----

PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Solid Waste Pollution, and the PRC Law on the Prevention and
Control of Noise Pollution. Manufacturers are required to build environmental treatment facilities during the
construction of their manufacturing sites in order to adequately treat the waste air, waste water and waste solids
generated by their production facilities.

**_Overview of Environmental Permits and Licences_**

In China, a manufacturer must go through the environmental assessment and acceptance approval process
before the commencement of each and every of its operations. The manufacturer must obtain from the local
environment protection bureau, on a step-by-step basis, (i) an approval of the environmental impact assessment
report prepared by a professional firm engaged by the manufacturer prior to commencement of the construction
of the plant, (ii) an approval for trial production (if required) upon completion of the plant and (iii) an approval of
a completion acceptance monitoring report prepared by a professional firm engaged by the manufacturer within 3
months of the trial production. Once these approvals become effective, the local environmental bureau will, upon
the manufacturer’s application, issue a regular pollutant discharge permit with a valid term of usually three years,
which is subject to renewable on a regular basis.

**_Day-to-Day Compliance Requirements_**

As previously mentioned, manufacturers must comply with national and local emission standards, which are
subject to change from time to time, in connection with their daily waste water, waste gas and noise emissions.
The manufacturers’ environmental treatment facilities, their installation, maintenance and operation must comply
with the environmental protection agency’s requirements. Further, in order to discharge any pollutants, the
manufacturer must obtain a valid pollutant discharge permit, which may be revoked or not extended if the
manufacturer is unable to comply with the above mentioned emission standards or requirements. Manufacturers
may also be required engage professional environment protection organizations to help regularly monitor and
report on their pollutant emissions.

**_Environmental Liabilities_**

It is important to note that if a manufacturer is in violation of any environmental law or regulation, in
addition to the possible revocation of its pollution discharge permit, it may be subject to admonitions, penalties,
investigations or inquiries imposed by the environmental regulators, suspension of operation or even closedown
of the manufacturer as well as other civil claims, criminal liabilities or other legal proceedings.

**_Clean-up Obligations_**

In addition, under the PRC Environmental Protection Law and PRC tort law, a manufacturer is responsible
for cleaning up in the event that its operations result in the contamination of the environment at its manufacturing
facilities. If a manufacturer violates or fails to comply with the requirements, it can be fined or otherwise
sanctioned by regulators.

**Compliance**

We are subject to the criminal laws applicable in the jurisdictions where we operate. In particular, our
managers and employees may be prosecuted if they commit acts of bribery, corruption, fraud or embezzlement.
Those criminal offenses may be punished by imprisonment or penalties. Also, the authorities may impose fines
on the company. Acts of bribery may constitute criminal offenses if committed by an economic operator in the
public or private sector by providing monies or other valuable goods in exchange for preferential treatment
compared to its competitors.

The responsible persons of our companies may be subject to criminal prosecution if they do not comply with
national or international export and import control and customs regulations.

**LuxCo, TopCo and HoldCo**

The members of the executive boards of LuxCo, TopCo and HoldCo are expected to be the same initially as
those of the Issuer.

140


-----

**PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS**

Following the Transactions, the Target will be the direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of BidCo, and LuxCo
will indirectly (through TopCo, HoldCo, the Issuer and BidCo as wholly-owned subsidiaries) own the entire
share capital of the Target. Bain Capital will control LuxCo and hold substantially all (subject to management
equity) of LuxCo’s total share capital, which includes ordinary shares and Preferred Equity Certificates
(“PECs”). On or about the Completion Date, Bain Capital (i) intends to establish a management equity
participation program under which senior management may hold approximately 11% of the ordinary shares of
LuxCo, subject to vesting periods, and (ii) may syndicate a portion of its securityholdings in LuxCo to third-party
investors.

**_Preferred Equity Certificates of LuxCo, Shareholder Loan to TopCo and Deferred Consideration_**

In connection with the formation of LuxCo, LuxCo issued ordinary shares to Bain Capital. In connection
with the financing of the Acquisition by Bain Capital, LuxCo will issue preferred equity certificates (“PECs”)
and ordinary shares (the “LuxCo Shares”) to Bain Capital and its co-investors. The PECs carry a yield at a fixed
rate, which will be capitalized as and when it falls due. The PECs will mature at least 29 years after the
Completion Date, will be subordinated to all of LuxCo’s existing and future third party indebtedness and will
have other terms characteristic of subordinated shareholder obligations.

On the Completion Date, LuxCo intends to (i) use the proceeds from the LuxCo Shares and part of the
proceeds from the issuance of the PECs to subscribe for shares in, and to contribute capital to, TopCo and (ii) onlend the remainder of the proceeds from the issuance of the PECs to TopCo under a shareholder loan (the
“LuxCo Shareholder Loan”). The LuxCo Shareholder Loan will mature 10 years after the Completion Date,
and will accrue interest, which will be capitalized as and when it falls due, unless TopCo elects to pay such
interest in cash, in each case at a fixed rate. TopCo, in turn, intends to contribute the proceeds from the LuxCo
Shareholder Loan to HoldCo and to subscribe for new shares in HoldCo. HoldCo intends to then contribute such
proceeds to the Issuer to subscribe for new shares of the Issuer. The Issuer will use the proceeds therefrom
(estimated to be approximately €203.3 million) to subscribe for new shares in BidCo and to loan the gross
proceeds of the Offering to BidCo via the Proceeds Loan.

As a result, BidCo will have received on the Completion Date proceeds in an aggregate principal amount
estimated at present to be €403.3 million under the Proceeds Loan and the equity subscription, and will use such
funds, together with a €220.0 million drawing under the Senior Facilities Agreement and cash on the balance
sheet of the Target, to pay the Purchase Price, repay the Existing Senior Facilities and certain other debt of
subsidiaries of the Target and pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions. See “Use of
Proceeds.”

In connection with the Acquisition and in lieu of receiving cash payment for part of the Purchase Price, the
Sellers, as lenders, entered into loans with HoldCo, as the ultimate borrower, which resulted in the deferral of a
part of the Purchase Price equal to €40.0 million (the “Deferred Consideration”). The first loan (the “Deferred
**Consideration I”) provides for two tranches with an initial principal amount of €11.4 million and €28.6 million,**
respectively, and is governed by German law. The borrower under the Deferred Consideration I will be HoldCo.
HoldCo’s obligations as borrower under the Deferred Consideration I will be subordinated to all its other debt
obligations, except for routine payables. The Deferred Consideration I will accrue interest at a certain initial
interest rate, subject to a gradual interest step-up and will become payable in full upon the earlier of (i) the
occurrence of certain defined exit events and (ii) the expiration of ten years after the closing of the Acquisition.
The Deferred Consideration I will be secured by a pledge over the shares of HoldCo if any amounts thereunder
remain outstanding after the expiration of eight years after the closing of the Acquisition. The first tranche of the
Deferred Consideration in the amount of €11.4 million will be subject to the borrower’s right to set-off certain
amounts payable under the Acquisition Agreement. The Sellers are required to grant a second loan (the
“Deferred Consideration II”) with an initial principal amount of €7.5 million and on the same terms as the
Deferred Consideration I, if any of the Target or its subsidiaries consummates prior to the maturity of the
Deferred Consideration an add-on acquisition that exceeds a certain enterprise value. In the event of such an addon acquisition, Tri Way HoldCo AB will also have the right to subscribe to equity interests in such target,
provided that such contribution shall not exceed €10.0 million and the equity interests subscribed for by Seller 1
shall be valued at fair market value. The Sellers’ interests in the Deferred Consideration can be transferred
without the borrower’s consent, except that the first tranche under the Deferred Consideration I shall not be
transferred to persons other than affiliates of such Seller without the borrower’s consent.

141


-----

None of the PECs, the LuxCo Shareholder Loan or the Deferred Consideration will have any recourse to the
Issuer or any of its subsidiaries.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

In the course of our ordinary business activities, we regularly enter into agreements with companies within
the Group. These agreements mainly relate to the supply of finished and unfinished products within the Group,
the provision of billing, IT and accounting services, and the rendering of other intra-group services, such as
business advisory, treasury and finance, marketing, human resources and tax. In addition, it is contemplated that
new related party transactions will be entered into in connection with the Transactions.

**Shareholder Loans**

Historically, we have received loans from our former parent companies. A shareholder loan in the amount of
€70.5 million (excluding accrued interest) as of September 30, 2014, will be repaid in connection with the
Transactions. We repaid a portion of this shareholder loan in 2013.

**Triton Consultancy Services**

The Wittur Group has entered into a consulting agreement with Triton pursuant to which it receives
consulting services (for example, as to procurement and other strategies) from Triton West Park Management
Services, an affiliate of Triton. In the year ended December 31, 2013, expenses incurred under this consulting
agreement were €0.3 million.

**Transaction and Consulting Services Agreements**

Upon consummation of the Acquisition, we may enter into transaction and consulting services agreements
with Bain Capital pursuant to which we will make certain payments to Bain Capital for management, consulting,
monitoring or advisory services and related expenses.

**Management Equity Plan**

Certain members of our senior management hold equity interests in the Target Group prior to the
Acquisition and will thus receive proceeds from the sale of the Target Group to Bain Capital. Upon
consummation of the Acquisition, Bain Capital intends to establish a management equity plan under which these
managers will reinvest a substantial portion of their sale proceeds. As a result, we expect that the members of our
senior management will hold, directly or indirectly, ordinary shares in LuxCo equal to approximately 11% of
LuxCo’s ordinary share capital subject to vesting periods.

**Senior Facilities Agreement**

**_Overview and Structure_**

In connection with the Financing of the Acquisition, BidCo will, on or prior to the Completion Date, enter
into the Senior Facilities Agreement with, among others, Credit Suisse AG, London Branch, as agent and
security agent, and Credit Suisse International, Barclays Bank PLC, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and
Royal Bank of Canada, as mandated lead arrangers. The Senior Facilities Agreement will provide for committed
facilities in the following amounts:

    - a €220.0 million senior secured term loan B facility (the “New Term Loan B Facility”); and

    - a €65.0 million senior secured multi-currency revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit
**Facility” and, together with the New Term Loan B Facility, the “Senior Facilities” (each a “Senior**
**Facility”)).**

The New Term Loan B Facility may be utilized by BidCo and may be used to finance: (i) the payment of the
consideration for the Acquisition, (ii) the financing of the payment of certain fees, costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the Transactions, and (iii) the refinancing of existing indebtedness of the TLB Group and
payments of related breakage costs and any other costs related to such refinancing.

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by certain members of the TLB Group (for the purposes of
the Senior Facilities Agreement, the “TLB Group” consists of BidCo and its subsidiaries but excluding
Excluded Subsidiaries (as defined therein) and, in certain cases, includes the Issuer) in euros, sterling, U.S.
dollars, and certain other currencies freely available in the London interbank market (subject to obtaining the
consent of all the Revolving Credit Facility lenders) by the drawing of cash advances, the issue of letters of credit
and ancillary facilities. The Revolving Credit Facility may be used for the TLB Group’s working capital and
general corporate purposes.

In addition to the New Term Loan B Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Facilities
Agreement includes the ability to incur additional indebtedness (including under one or more uncommitted
additional facilities with the Senior Facilities Agreement and/or any additional Notes) up to an aggregate amount
of €50.0 million (subject to certain adjustments), plus an unlimited amount, provided that, pro forma for the
incurrence of such additional facilities: (i) if such indebtedness is senior secured liabilities, the consolidated
senior secured net leverage ratio does not exceed 3.15:1; or (ii) if the indebtedness is not senior secured liabilities
the consolidated total net leverage ratio does not exceed 5.90:1, and in each case, subject to certain other
conditions being met.

**_Availability_**

The New Term Loan B Facility will be available up to (and including) the earliest to occur of (i) the date
falling 5 Business Days after the date of completion, (ii) September 30, 2015 and (iii) the date on which Bidco
(or an affiliate) notifies the agent under the Senior Facilities Agreement that its rights under the Acquisition
Agreement have been conclusively terminated. The New Term Loan B Facility must be drawn in full on the date
of first utilization under the Senior Facilities.

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized from the date of the first utilization of the New Term Loan B
Facility until the date which is one month prior to the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the Senior Facilities Agreement will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal to LIBOR
or, for loans denominated in euro, EURIBOR and the following applicable margins:

    - % per annum in respect of loans under the New Term Loan B Facility; and

    - % per annum in respect of loans under the Revolving Credit Facility,

144


-----

subject in each case to a decreasing margin ratchet based on the ratio of consolidated senior secured net debt to
consolidated pro forma EBITDA (each as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement).

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving
Credit Facility from the Completion Date to the end of the availability period applicable of the Revolving Credit
Facility at a rate of 40% of the applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility. Commitment fees will be
payable quarterly in arrears and on the date the relevant Senior Facility is canceled in full or on the date on which
the relevant lender cancels its commitment.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the defaulted amount.

**_Repayments_**

The New Term Loan B Facility will be repaid in full on the date that is seven years from the first utilization
date of the Senior Facilities. In respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, each advance will be repaid on the last
day of the interest period relating thereto, subject to an ability to roll over cash drawings. All outstanding
amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the date falling six years from the first utilization
date of the Senior Facilities. Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility
may be reborrowed, subject to certain conditions.

**_Mandatory Prepayment_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement will provide for voluntary prepayments to be made (subject to de minimis
amounts) and will require mandatory prepayment in full or in part in certain circumstances, including:

    - on a change of control or disposal of substantially all the business of the TLB Group;

    - on an initial public offering (subject to the TLB Group’s ratio of consolidated senior secured net debt to
consolidated pro forma EBITDA (each as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement);

    - from certain net cash proceeds received by the TLB Group from certain disposals of assets, insurance
claims and recovery claims from the vendors and report providers, in each case to the extent that such
net cash proceeds exceed certain agreed thresholds and have not satisfied other conditions; and

    - for each financial year (commencing with the financial year ending December 31, 2016), a percentage
of excess cash flow in the event that excess cash flow exceeds a minimum threshold amount, which
percentage decreases as the TLB Group’s ratio of consolidated senior secured net debt to consolidated
_pro forma EBITDA (each as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) decreases._

**_Guarantees and Security_**

The Senior Facilities will benefit from substantially the same guarantees as the Notes, but on a senior basis.
The Senior Facilities, unlike the Notes, will also benefit from security granted by certain subsidiaries of the
Target, including security granted by certain subsidiaries incorporated in Austria, England and Wales, Germany,
Italy, Spain, Sweden and Turkey, over their material assets.

Solely for the benefit of the lenders participating in the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Facilities
Agreement will require that, in the event that the aggregate amount of all cash loans drawn under the Revolving
Credit Facility (excluding any utilizations by way of letters of credit or ancillary facilities or any amounts utilized
to fund any agreed fees in connection with the syndication of the Senior Facilities) exceeds an agreed percentage
of the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility on the relevant testing date or, if higher, the total
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility as at the original date of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the
ratio of consolidated senior secured net debt to consolidated pro forma EBITDA does not exceed an agreed ratio.
The ratio is based on the definitions in the Senior Facilities Agreement, which may differ from similar definitions
in the Indenture and the equivalent definitions described in this Offering Memorandum.

It is intended that certain agreed covenants and other provisions of the Senior Facilities Agreement will fallaway on the satisfaction of certain release conditions, being (i) the occurrence of a listing in respect of which the
TLB Group’s ratio of consolidated total net debt to consolidated pro forma EBITDA does not exceed an agreed

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the terms of any finance document evidencing Senior Secured
Creditor Liabilities (a “Senior Secured Finance Document”) may not be waived or amended without the
consent of the Majority Senior Lenders if such amendment or waiver would result in the Senior Secured Notes
finance document being inconsistent with the “Senior Secured Liabilities Major Terms”. The Senior Secured
Liabilities Major Terms stipulate requirements for Senior Secured Notes, including minimum maturity, the
relevant indenture in respect of the Senior Secured Notes permitting the guarantees and security taken for the
benefit of the other liabilities regulated under the Intercreditor Agreement, being subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and a requirement for market terms.

          - to the Shared Security Agent under a parallel debt structure, joint and several creditor
structure or agency structure for the benefit of the other Priority Secured Parties,

and ranks in the same order of priority as set out under the caption “—Priority of Security,”
provided that all amounts received by any lenders under the Permitted Senior Secured Facilities

-----

if and to the extent legally possible, and subject to certain agreed security principles, at the same
time it is also offered to the other Priority Secured Parties in respect of their liabilities and ranks in
the same order of priority as set out under the caption “—Ranking and Priority” and all amounts
received by any Senior Secured Creditor with respect to such guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance against loss are immediately paid to the Shared Security Agent and held and applied in
accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds.”

**_Restriction on Enforcement: Senior Secured Creditors_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Senior Secured Creditors may not take any action to
enforce the transaction security without the prior written consent of an Instructing Group (as defined below).

An “Instructing Group” means at any time:

    - prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors;

    - on or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but before the later to occur of (i) the discharge of the
Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Senior Liabilities and the hedging liabilities (the “Senior Secured
**Liabilities”) and (ii) the discharge of the Second Lien Lender Liabilities and the Second Lien Notes**
Liabilities (together the “Second Lien Liabilities” and such date the “Priority Discharge Date”)), the
Majority Second Lien Creditors; and

    - on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the date the Midco Notes Liabilities and the Midco
Facility Liabilities have been discharged, the Majority Midco Creditors.

“Majority Second Lien Creditors” means, at any time when (i) there are no Second Lien Notes Liabilities
outstanding, Second Lien Lenders and Second Lien Noteholders whose Second Lien Credit Participations
aggregate more than 66 [2]⁄3% of the total Second Lien Credit Participations at that time; and (ii) there are Second
Lien Notes Liabilities outstanding, Second Lien Lenders and Second Lien Noteholders whose Second Lien
Credit Participations aggregate more than 50% of the total Second Lien Credit Participations at that time.

“Majority Senior Secured Creditors” means, at any time, when (i) there are no Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities outstanding, Senior Lenders and certain hedge counterparties whose Senior Credit Participations
aggregate more than 66 [2]⁄3% of the total Senior Credit Participations at that time; and (ii) there are Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities outstanding, Senior Lenders and certain hedge counterparties whose Senior Credit
Participations aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Credit Participations at that time.

“Majority Midco Creditors” means, at any time when (i) there are no Midco Notes Liabilities outstanding,
those Midco Creditors whose Midco Credit Participations aggregate more than 66 [2]⁄3% of the total Midco Credit
Participations at that time; and (ii) there are Midco Notes Liabilities outstanding, those Midco Creditors whose
Midco Credit Participations aggregate more than 50% of the total Midco Credit Participations at that time.

“Second Lien Credit Participations” refers to drawn and undrawn commitments under Second Lien
Facilities and the principal amount of outstanding Second Lien Notes held by a Second Lien Noteholder.

“Senior Credit Participations” refers to drawn and undrawn commitments under the Permitted Senior
Secured Facilities, amounts payable for terminated or closed out hedging obligations and amounts that would be
payable in respect of hedging obligations if they were terminated or closed out at that time.

“Midco Credit Participations” refers to drawn and undrawn commitments under Midco Facilities and the
principal amount of outstanding Midco Notes held by a Midco Noteholder.

**_Restrictions Relating to Second Lien Liabilities_**

The Intercreditor Agreement contains customary provisions governing payment of Second Lien Liabilities
and the circumstances in which Second Lien Creditors (defined below) may take enforcement action. On the
Completion Date, no Second Lien Liabilities will have been incurred by the ICA Group.

Prior to the the first date on which all Senior Secured Liabilities have been discharged (the “Senior Secured
**Discharge Date”), the Debtors may only make scheduled payments in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities, in**
accordance with the finance documents governing such Second Lien Liabilities, subject to compliance with
certain conditions in the Intercreditor Agreement. The principal conditions are that the relevant payment is not
prohibited by the Senior Facilities Agreement (or any other facility agreement evidencing Senior Lender
Liabilities) or any Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or if it is so prohibited, that all necessary consents have been
obtained to permit it), no payment stop notice has been issued to the Second Lien Agent or the trustee in respect
of any Second Lien Notes (the “Second Lien Notes Trustee”), and no Senior Secured Payment Default (defined
below) is continuing.

**_Restrictions Relating to Midco Notes_**

_Restriction on Payment and Dealings_

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, until the Priority Discharge Date, BidCo shall not (and shall
ensure that no member of the ICA Group will):

(i) pay, repay, prepay, redeem, acquire or defease any principal, interest or other amount on or in respect
of, or make any distribution in respect of, any Midco Guarantee Liabilities or Midco Proceeds Loan
Liabilities (together, “Midco Group Liabilities”) in cash or in kind or apply any such money or
property in or towards discharge of any such liabilities except as permitted by the provisions set out

guarantee (and the Midco Notes Trustee and the agent under a Midco Facility may not, and no creditor
in respect of Midco Notes or a Midco Facility (together the “Midco Creditors”) nor Midco may
accept, the benefit of any such security or guarantee) from any member of the ICA Group for, or in

Midco Group Liabilities other than to the extent not prohibited by the relevant finance documents in
respect of the Permitted Senior Secured Facilities, Senior Secured Notes, Second Lien Facilities,

the Midco Liabilities or the Midco Group Liabilities) or Midco (in respect of the Midco Proceeds Loan
Liabilities only) then due in accordance with the finance documents in respect of the Midco Facility or Midco
Notes (the “Midco Finance Documents”) or the Midco Proceeds Loan Agreement (such payments, collectively,
“Permitted Midco Payments”):

(i) if:

(A) the payment is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreements (in respect of the Senior
Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or any required consents to permit such
payment has been obtained;

(B) no Midco Payment Stop Notice (defined below) is outstanding; and

(C) no payment default under the Permitted Senior Secured Facilities or the Senior Secured Notes (a
“Senior Secured Payment Default”), or under the Second Lien Facilities or Second Lien Notes

(ii) if:

(A) the payment is in accordance with a provision in the Midco finance document which is
substantially equivalent to the illegality provisions in the Senior Facilities Agreement; and

(B) no acceleration event has occurred under the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien
Liabilities;

(iii) if the payment is of any amount of the Midco Liabilities outstanding which would have been payable
but for the issue of a Midco Payment Stop Notice (which has since expired) which has been capitalized
and added to the principal amount of the Midco Liabilities provided that no such payment may be made
if any Event of Default under the Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities is continuing or
would occur as a result of making such payment;

152


-----

(iv) if the payment is of certain amounts due to the Midco Notes Trustee, any other Midco notes trustee or
an agent under a Midco Facility;

(v) if the payment is of certain administration and maintenance costs, expenses and taxes of Midco (in
acting as a holding company of the Midco Group and borrower or issuer of the Midco Liabilities),
including any reporting or listing requirement and costs and expenses of any security agent in relation
to the protection, preservation or enforcement of such security;

(vi) of any costs, commissions, taxes, premiums, amendment, consent and/or waiver fees and any expenses
incurred in respect of (or reasonably incidental to) the Midco finance documents (including in relation
to any reporting or listing requirements thereunder);

(vii) following the occurrence of a Midco Event of Default which is continuing, all or part of the Midco
Proceeds Loan Liabilities being released or otherwise discharged solely in consideration for the issues
of shares in any Holding Company of Bidco (each, a “Debt for Equity Swap”) provided that no cash
or cash equivalent payment is made in respect of the Midco Proceeds Loan Liabilities and any
Liabilities owed by a member of the ICA Group to another member of the ICA Group, the
Subordinated Creditors or any other Holding Company of Bidco that arise as a result of any such Debt
for Equity Swap are subordinated to the Senior Secured Liabilities and Second Lien Liabilities
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Creditors and Second Lien Creditors
are granted Transaction Security in respect of any of those Midco Proceeds Loan Liabilities owed by
BidCo;

(viii) of any other amount not exceeding €750,000 (or its equivalent in other currencies) in aggregate in any
twelve month period; and

(ix) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and the Majority Second Lien Creditors give prior consent to
that Payment being made.

On or after the Priority Discharge Date, the Debtors may make payments to the Midco Creditors or MidCo
(in respect of the Midco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) in respect of the Midco Liabilities or Midco Group
Liabilities in accordance with the Midco Finance Documents and Midco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as
applicable).

_Payment Blockage Provisions_

A Midco Payment Stop Notice is outstanding during the period from the date on which, following the
occurrence of an event of default in respect of the Permitted Senior Secured Facilities or the Senior Secured
Notes (a “Senior Secured Event of Default”) or an event of default under a Second Lien Facility or Second Lien
Notes (a “Second Lien Event of Default”), the Shared Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the
Instructing Group) issues a notice (a “Midco Payment Stop Notice”) to the agent under any Midco Facility (the
“Midco Agent”) or the Midco Notes Trustee (with a copy to Midco) advising that the Senior Secured Event of
Default or Second Lien Event of Default is continuing and suspending payments by the ICA Group of the Midco
Liabilities and Midco Group Liabilities, until the first to occur of:

    - the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Midco Payment Stop Notice;

    - if a Midco standstill period is in effect at any time after delivery of that payment stop notice, the date
on which that standstill period expires;

    - the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default has
been remedied or waived in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents or finance
documents applicable to a Second Lien Facility or Second Lien Notes (the “Second Lien Finance
**Documents”) (as applicable);**

    - the date on which the Shared Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors and the Majority Second Lien Creditors) (as applicable) delivers a notice to MidCo, the
Midco Agent and the Midco Notes Trustee cancelling the payment stop notice; and

    - the Priority Discharge Date.

153


-----

No Midco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Shared Security Agent in reliance on a Senior
Secured Event of Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than 45 days after the occurrence of the event
of default constituting that Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default (as applicable).

No more than one Midco Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect to the same event or set of
circumstances, or (ii) in any period of 365 days.

Any failure to make a payment due under the Midco Finance Documents or Midco Proceeds Loan
Agreement as a result of the issue of a Midco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a
consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Midco Finance Document or Midco
Proceeds Loan Agreement; or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice in respect of an event of default in respect of
a Midco Facility or Midco Notes (a “Midco Enforcement Notice”) on behalf of the Midco Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

No Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which
shall continue to accrue) under any Midco Finance Document or Midco Proceeds Loan Agreement by the
operation of the provisions set out under each section above under the caption “—Restrictions relating to Midco
Notes” even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of those
provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the Midco Finance Documents or
Midco Proceeds Loan Agreement shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a Midco Payment Stop Notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Midco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Midco Payment Stop Notice ceases to be
outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Midco Creditors or MidCo (in respect of the Midco
Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under the Midco
Finance Documents or the Midco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable) and which would have
been Permitted Midco Payments but for that Midco Payment Stop Notice or Senior Secured Payment
Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be),

then any Event of Default which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived
and any Midco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that Event of Default shall be
waived, in each case without any further action being required on the part of the Midco Creditors or MidCo (in
respect of the Midco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only).

_Restrictions on Amendments and Waivers_

Subject to the following two paragraphs, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Midco Creditors
may amend or waive the terms of the Midco Finance Documents (other than the Intercreditor Agreement or any
security document) in accordance with their terms at any time, subject to any consent required under them.

Prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the finance parties (the “Midco Finance Parties”) both under and as
defined in any agreement documenting a Midco Facility (a “Midco Facility Agreement”) and under the Midco
Notes may not, without the consent of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and the Majority Second Lien
Creditors, amend or waive the terms of the Midco Finance Documents if the amendment or waiver would result
in the Midco Finance Documents being inconsistent with the Midco Liabilities Major Terms. The Midco
Liabilities Major Terms stipulate requirements for any incurrence of Midco Liabilities, including the identity of
the issuer, minimum maturity and being subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

154


-----

Prior to the Priority Discharge Date, MidCo and BidCo may not amend or waive the terms of the Midco
Proceeds Loan Agreement if such amendment or waiver would result in Bidco being subject to more onerous
obligations than those contained in the relevant Midco Finance Document (under which the proceeds of the
relevant Midco Facility or Midco Notes are borrowed or issued to be on-lent) to which the Midco Proceeds Loan
Agreement relates. This restriction shall not apply if such amendment or waiver relates to an increase in the
applicable margin or coupon payable on the relevant Midco Proceeds Loan Agreement (provided that such
margin or coupon (as the case may be) may be higher than the margin or coupon payable on the relevant Midco
Facility or Midco Notes to which the Midco Proceeds Loan Agreement relates) to the extent it is customary for
such Midco Proceeds Loan Agreement at the date of borrowing or issuance thereunder, taking into account the
then current market conditions (which determination may be made in the good faith judgment of the board of
directors of BidCo (for which it can conclusively rely on the advice and feedback of its tax advisers)).

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Midco Finance Party_

Until the Priority Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group:

(i) no Midco Finance Party nor MidCo shall direct the Shared Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise
(to the extent applicable) require the enforcement of, any Shared Collateral; and

(ii) no Midco Finance Party nor Midco shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action
against a member of the ICA Group in relation to the Midco Group Liabilities,

except as permitted under the provisions set out under the caption “—Permitted Midco Enforcement” below,
_provided, however, that no such action required by an Instructing Group need be taken except to the extent such_
Instructing Group otherwise is entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to direct such action.

Any Midco Creditor may at any time take any Enforcement Action against MidCo or any guarantor of
Midco Liabilities which is not a member of the ICA Group in each case in each case in accordance with the
Midco Finance Documents.

“Enforcement Action” is defined as:

    - in relation to any liabilities:

       - the acceleration of any liabilities or the making of any declaration that any liabilities are
prematurely due and payable (other than as a result of it becoming unlawful for a Senior Lender, a
holder of Senior Secured Notes, a Second Lien Lender, a Second Lien Noteholder, a Midco
Lender or a holder of Midco Notes to perform its obligations under, or of any voluntary or
mandatory prepayment arising under, the Debt Documents);

       - the making of any declaration that any liabilities are payable on demand;

       - the making of a demand in relation to a liability that is payable on demand;

       - the making of any demand against any member of the ICA Group in relation to any guarantee
liabilities of that member of the ICA Group;

       - the exercise of any right to require any member of the ICA Group to acquire any liability
(including exercising any put or call option against any member of the ICA Group for the
redemption or purchase of any liability but excluding any such right which arises as a result of the
permitted debt purchase transactions provisions of the Senior Facilities Agreement or any
substantially equivalent provisions in any other facility agreement documenting Senior Lender
Liabilities other than the Senior Facilities Agreement and which is permitted by the Intercreditor
Agreement (a “Permitted Senior Secured Facility Agreement”), the Senior Secured Notes
finance documents, any agreement documenting a Second Lien Facility (a “Second Lien Facility
**Agreement”), Second Lien Notes finance documents, a Midco Facility Agreement or the Midco**
Notes finance documents and excluding any mandatory offer arising as a result of a change of
control or asset sale (howsoever described) as set out in the finance documents relating to the
Senior Secured Notes, Second Lien Notes or Midco Notes);

       - the exercise of any right of set-off, account combination or payment netting against any member
of the ICA Group in respect of any liabilities other than the exercise of any such right:

          - as close-out netting by a hedge counterparty or by a hedging ancillary lender;

          - as payment netting by a hedge counterparty or by a hedging ancillary lender;

155


-----

          - as inter-hedging agreement netting by a hedge counterparty;

          - as inter-hedging ancillary document netting by a hedging ancillary lender; and

          - which is otherwise expressly permitted under the Senior Facilities Agreement, a Permitted
Senior Secured Facility Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes finance documents, a Second
Lien Facility Agreement, Second Lien Notes finance documents, a Midco Facility Agreement
or the Midco Notes finance documents to the extent that the exercise of that right gives effect
to a permitted payment under the Intercreditor Agreement; and

       - the suing for, commencing or joining of any legal or arbitration proceedings against any member
of the ICA Group to recover any liabilities;

    - the premature termination or close-out of any hedging transaction under any hedging agreement, save
to the extent permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement;

    - the taking of any steps to enforce or require the enforcement of any security (including the
crystallization of any floating charge forming part of the security) as a result of an acceleration event
which was continuing at the time the request for enforcement was made;

    - the entering into of any composition, compromise, assignment or similar arrangement with any
member of the ICA Group which owes any liabilities, or has given any security, guarantee or
indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of the liabilities of the ICA Group owed to a
creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement (other than any action permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any debt buy-backs pursuant to open market debt repurchases, tender offers or exchange
offers entered into in accordance with the relevant finance documents and not undertaken as part of an
announced restructuring or turnaround plan or while a default was outstanding under the relevant
finance documents); or

    - the petitioning, applying or voting for, or the taking of any steps (including the appointment of any
liquidator, receiver, administrator or similar officer) in relation to the winding up, dissolution,
administration or reorganization of any member of the ICA Group which owes any liabilities of the
ICA Group owed to a creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, or has given any security, guarantee,
indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of any of the liabilities, or any of such member of
the ICA Group’s assets or any suspension of payments or moratorium of any indebtedness of any such
member of the ICA Group, or any analogous procedure or step in any jurisdiction,

except that the following shall not constitute Enforcement Action:

    - the taking of any action falling within the seventh paragraph of the first bullet point above or the bullet
point immediately above which is necessary (but only to the extent necessary) to preserve the validity,
existence or priority of claims in respect of liabilities, including the registration of such claims before
any court or governmental authority and the bringing, supporting or joining of proceedings to prevent
any loss of the right to bring, support or join proceedings by reason of applicable limitation periods; or

    - unless an acceleration event is continuing, a demand made by (i) Holdco or Midco or any other person
which accedes as a subordinated creditor to the Intercreditor Agreement (a “Subordinated Creditor”),
or (ii) an intra-group lender in relation to the liabilities owed to a Subordinated Creditor or intra-group
liabilities to the extent that (A) any resulting payment would constitute a “Permitted Subordinated
Payment” or a “Permitted Intra-Group Payment” or a “Permitted Transaction” (under the Senior
Facilities Agreement or any substantially equivalent provisions in a Permitted Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, a Second Lien Facility Agreement or Midco Facility Agreement) or (B) any subordinated
creditor liability or intra-group liability of a member of the Midco Group being released or discharged
in consideration for the issue of shares in that member of the Midco Group provided that the ownership
interest of the member of the Midco Group prior to such issue is not diluted as a result and provided
further that (in any such case) in the event that the shares of such member of the Midco Group are
subject to transaction security prior to such issue, then the percentage of shares in such subsidiary
subject to transaction security is not diluted; or

    - an ancillary lender, hedge counterparty, issuing bank, Second Lien Agent, Second Lien Notes Trustee,
Midco Agent or the Midco Note Trustee bringing legal proceedings against any person solely for the
purpose of (A) obtaining injunctive relief (or any analogous remedy outside England and Wales) to
restrain any actual or putative breach of any debt document to which it is party; (B) obtaining specific
performance (other than specific performance of an obligation to make a payment) with no claim for
damages; (C) requesting judicial interpretation of any provision of any debt document to which it is
party with no claim for damages; or

156


-----

    - bringing legal proceedings against any person in connection with any securities violation, securities or
listing relations or common law fraud or to restrain any actual or putative breach of the finance
documents relating to the Permitted Senior Secured Facilities, Senior Secured Notes and certain
hedging agreements, finance documents relating to the Second Lien Facilities or Second Lien Notes, or
Midco Finance Documents or for specific performance with no claims for damages.

_Permitted Midco Enforcement_

The restrictions set out under the caption “—Restrictions on Enforcement by Midco Finance Party” above
will not apply in respect of the Midco Group Liabilities or the documents evidencing the Shared Collateral (if
any) which secure the Midco Liabilities or Midco Group Liabilities (as applicable) as permitted by paragraph
(iii) set out under the caption “—Restriction on Payment and Dealings” above, if:

(i) a Midco Event of Default (the “Relevant Midco Default”) is continuing;

(ii) the Senior Agent, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Second Lien Agent and Second Lien Notes
Trustee has received a notice of the Relevant Midco Default specifying the event or circumstance in
relation to the Relevant Midco Default from the Midco Note Trustee, Midco Agent or MidCo;

(iii) a Midco Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Midco Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Midco Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of an event of default under a Midco Facility Agreement or the indenture
for the Midco Notes (the “Midco Notes Indenture” and such event of default a “Midco Event of Default”), the
Midco Notes Trustee, Midco Agent or MidCo (as the case may be) may by notice (a “Midco Enforcement
**Notice”) in writing notify the Senior Agent, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Second Lien Agent and**
Second Lien Notes Trustee of the existence of such Midco Event of Default.

_Midco Standstill Period_

In relation to a Relevant Midco Default, a Midco Standstill Period shall mean the period beginning on the
date (the “Midco Standstill Start Date”) the Midco Notes Trustee, Midco Agent or MidCo serves a Midco
Enforcement Notice on the Senior Agent and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Second Lien Agent and
Second Lien Notes Trustee in respect of such Relevant Midco Default and ending on the earliest to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after the Midco Note Standstill Start Date (the “Midco Standstill Period”);

(ii) the date the Priority Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular Debtor,
_provided that:_

(A) if a Midco Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph (ii), the Midco Finance Parties or
MidCo (in respect of the Midco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may only take the same
Enforcement Action in relation to a guarantor in respect of a Midco Facility or Midco Notes (a
“Midco Guarantor”) as the Enforcement Action taken by the Priority Secured Parties against
such Midco Guarantor and not against any other member of the ICA Group; and

(B) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph shall not include action taken to preserve or
protect any security as opposed to realize it;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event (as defined below) in relation to a particular Midco Guarantor against
whom Enforcement Action is to be taken; and

(iv) the expiry of any other Midco Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first mentioned Midco

_Option to purchase: Midco Creditors_

Upon acceleration of the Permitted Senior Secured Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes, a Second Lien
Facility, Second Lien Notes, a Midco Facility or the Midco Notes or enforcement of the transaction security,
Midco Creditors may elect to purchase the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Second
Lien Lender Liabilities and Second Lien Notes Liabilities for the amount that would have been required to
prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses. Midco Creditors must also elect
for the counterparties to hedging obligations to transfer their hedging obligations to holders in exchange for the
amount that would have been payable under such hedging obligations had they been terminated on such date plus
certain costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase.

**_Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims_**

An “Insolvency Event” means any formal corporate action or legal proceeding is taken in relation to:

    - the suspension of payments, a moratorium of any indebtedness, winding up, dissolution, bankruptcy,
administration or reorganisation (by way of voluntary arrangement, scheme of arrangement or
otherwise) of any material subsidiary or debtor under and as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement
(each a “Material Subsidiary” and an “Debtor” respectively) or Midco;

    - a composition, compromise, assignment or arrangement with any class of creditors generally (other

The “Secured Parties” comprises (i) the Shared Security Agent, (ii) any receiver or delegate, (iii) each of
the Senior Agent, each Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Second Lien Agent, the Second Lien Notes Trustee,
each Midco Agent and each Midco Notes Trustee (together the “Agents”), (iv) the arrangers of the Permitted
Senior Secured Facilities, the Second Lien Facilities and the Midco Facilities, and (v) the Primary Creditors
(excluding the Notes Security Agent).

The “Midco Secured Parties” comprises (i) the Notes Security Agent, (ii) any receiver or delegate, and
(iii) each of the creditors in respect of a Midco Facility or Midco Notes (excluding the Shared Security Agent).

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any
member of the Midco Group, any party entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of that member of the
Midco Group in respect of liabilities owed to that party shall, to the extent it is able to do so, direct the person
responsible for the distribution of the assets of that member of the Midco Group to pay that distribution to the
Shared Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. In this respect, the
Shared Security Agent shall apply distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under the
caption “—Application of Proceeds” below.

158


-----

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to Midco, any Midco Secured Party entitled to
receive a distribution out of the assets of Midco in respect of Midco Liabilities or Midco Proceeds Loan
Liabilities owed to that Midco Secured Party (except to the extent that such distribution arises as a result of the
Shared Collateral) shall, to the extent it is able to do so, direct the person responsible for the distribution of the
assets of Midco to pay that distribution to the Notes Security Agent until the Midco Liabilities or Midco Proceeds
Loan Liabilities owing to the Midco Secured Parties have been paid in full. The Notes Security Agent shall apply
distributions paid to it under this paragraph above in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—
Application of Proceeds” below.

Generally, to the extent that any member of Midco Group’s liabilities are discharged by way of set-off
(mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to that member of the ICA
Group, any creditor which benefited from that set-off shall pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities
owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Shared Security Agent for application in accordance with
the provisions set out in the caption “—Application of Proceeds” below.

To the extent that the Midco Liabilities or Midco Proceeds Loan Liabilities of Midco are discharged by way
of set-off (mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to Midco (except to
the extent arising as a result of the Shared Collateral), any Midco Secured Party which benefited from that set-off
shall pay an amount equal to the amount of the Midco Liabilities or Midco Proceeds Loan Liabilities owed to it
which are discharged by that set-off to the Independent Security Agent for application in accordance with the
provisions set out in the caption “—Application of Proceeds” below.

If a Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect
of any of the liabilities owed to them by a member of the ICA Group, the liabilities will not be reduced by that
distribution until and except to the extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such
liabilities.

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any member of Midco Group, each creditor (or, in
relation to an Insolvency Event in relation to Midco, each Midco Secured Party) irrevocably authorizes the
applicable Security Agent, on its behalf, to:

(i) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) against that
member of the ICA Group or Midco (as applicable);

(ii) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of that member of the ICA Group’s (or Midco’s (as
applicable)) liabilities owed to the creditors under the debt documents;

(iii) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of that member of the ICA Group’s
(or Midco’s (as applicable)) liabilities owed to the creditors under the debt documents; and

(iv) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Shared Security Agent considers reasonably
necessary to recover that member of the ICA Group’s (or Midco’s (as applicable)) liabilities owed to
the creditors under the debt documents.

Each creditor will (i) do all things that the relevant Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give
effect to the matters disclosed under this section and (ii) if the relevant Security Agent is not entitled to take any
of the actions contemplated by this section or if the relevant Security Agent requests that a creditor take that
action, undertake that action itself in accordance with the instructions of the relevant Security Agent or grant a
power of attorney to the relevant Security Agent (on such terms as the relevant Security Agent may reasonably
require, although no trustee shall be under any obligation to grant such powers of attorney) to enable the relevant
Security Agent to take such action.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if any creditor receives or
recovers from any member of the ICA Group:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the
creditors under the debt documents which is not either (x) a payment permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out below under the caption “—
Application of Proceeds”;

159


-----

(ii) any amount by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it which does not give effect to
a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the debt
documents:

(I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any security; or

(II) as a result of any other litigation or proceedings against a member of the Midco Group (other
than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that member of the Midco
Group); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any security,

other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the provisions set out
below the caption “—Application of Proceeds”;

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Shared Collateral except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under the caption “—Application of Proceeds”; or

(v) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities
owed by any member of the ICA Group which is not in accordance with the provisions set out in the
caption “—Application of Proceeds” and which is made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an
insolvency event in respect of that member of the ICA Group,

that Creditor will: (i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an
amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or recovered) on
trust (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) for the Shared Security Agent and promptly pay or distribute
that amount to the Shared Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or
recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Shared Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of setoff, promptly pay an amount equal to that recovery to the Shared Security Agent for application in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time prior to the
latest to occur of the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Second Lien Discharge Date and the Midco Discharge
Date, any Midco Creditor receives or recovers from any member of the Midco Group certain payments which are
not (inter alia) payments permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or made in accordance with the provisions
set out below under the caption “—Application of Proceeds”. In such circumstances, that Midco Creditor will:
(i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an amount of that
receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or recovered) on trust (or
otherwise on behalf and for the account of) for the Notes Security Agent and promptly pay that amount to the
Notes Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and
(y) promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant
liabilities to the Notes Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement; and (ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay
an amount equal to that recovery to the Notes Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

(i) the Instructing Group; (ii) if required under the third paragraph of this section, the Second Lien Agent or
Second Lien Notes Trustee (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors), or (iii) if required
under the fourth paragraph of this section, the Midco Agent or Midco Notes Trustee (each a “Midco Creditor

-----

Subject to the Shared Collateral having become enforceable in accordance with its terms (i) the Instructing
Group; or (ii) to the extent permitted to enforce or to require the enforcement of the Shared Collateral prior to the

on the instructions of the Majority Midco Creditors), as applicable, may give, or refrain from giving, instructions
to the Shared Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the Shared Collateral as they see fit.

Prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, (i) if the Instructing Group has instructed the Shared Security
Agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the Shared Collateral or (ii) in the absence of instructions from the
Instructing Group, and, in each case, the Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a Distressed
Disposal (as described below), the Shared Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the
Shared Collateral which the Majority Second Lien Creditors are then entitled to give to the Shared Security
Agent under the provisions under the Intercreditor Agreement relating to enforcement of security by Second Lien
Creditors.

Prior to Priority Discharge Date, (i) if the Instructing Group (or the Majority Second Lien Creditors

Lien Creditors pursuant to the paragraph above) has not required any Debtor to make a Distressed Disposal (as
described below), the Shared Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the Shared Collateral

Notwithstanding the preceding two paragraphs, if at any time the Second Lien Agent or Second Lien Notes
Trustee or Midco Creditor Representative is then entitled to give the Shared Security Agent instructions to
enforce the Shared Collateral pursuant to the preceding two paragraphs and the Second Lien Agent or Second
Lien Notes Trustee and/or Midco Creditor Representative (as applicable) either gives such instruction or
indicates any intention to give such instruction, then the Instructing Group may give instructions to the Shared
Security Agent to enforce the Shared Collateral as the Instructing Group sees fit in lieu of any instructions to
enforce given by the Midco Creditor Representative(s) under the provisions set out under the caption
_“—Permitted Midco Enforcement” above and the Shared Security Agent shall act on such instructions received_
from the Instructing Group.

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any Shared
Collateral or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the security documents governing such Shared
Collateral except through the Shared Security Agent.

_Manner of Enforcement—Shared Collateral_

If the Shared Collateral is being enforced as set forth above under the caption “—Enforcement
Instructions—Shared Collateral”, the Shared Security Agent shall enforce the Shared Collateral in such manner
(including, without limitation, the selection of any administrator of any Debtor to be appointed by the Shared
Security Agent) as:

    - the Instructing Group; or

    - prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, if (i) the Shared Security Agent has, pursuant to the third
paragraph of the preceding section, received instructions given by the Majority Second Lien Creditors
to enforce the Shared Collateral; and (ii) the Instructing Group has not given instructions as to the
manner of enforcement of the Shared Collateral, the Majority Second Lien Creditors; or

    - prior to the Priority Discharge Date, if (i) the Shared Security Agent has, pursuant to the fourth
paragraph of the preceding section, received instructions given by the Majority Midco Creditors to
enforce the Shared Collateral; and (ii) neither the Instructing Group nor the Majority Second Lien
Creditors have given instructions as to the manner of enforcement of the Shared Collateral, the
Majority Midco Creditors,

shall instruct or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Shared Security Agent sees fit.

161


-----

_Enforcement Instructions—Notes Collateral_

The Notes Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Notes Collateral unless instructed otherwise by
the relevant Midco Creditor Representative (acting on the instructions of the Majority Midco Creditors).

Subject to the Notes Collateral having become enforceable in accordance with its terms the Majority Midco
Creditors may give, or refrain from giving, instructions to the Notes Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from
enforcing, the Notes Collateral as they see fit.

No Midco Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any
Notes Collateral or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the security documents governing such Notes
Collateral except through the Notes Security Agent.

_Manner of Enforcement—Notes Collateral_

If the Notes Collateral is being enforced as set forth above under the caption “—Enforcement Instructions—
Notes Collateral”, the Notes Security Agent shall enforce the Notes Collateral in such manner (including, without
limitation, the selection of any administrator of any Debtor to be appointed by the Notes Security Agent) as the
Majority Midco Creditors shall instruct or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Notes Security Agent
sees fit.

_Exercise of Voting Rights_

MidCo, each intra-group lender and each Subordinated Creditor agrees (to the fullest extent permitted by
law at the relevant time) with the Shared Security Agent that it will cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote
by, or under the supervision of, any judicial or supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency
or rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating to any member of the ICA Group as instructed by the Shared
Security Agent. The Shared Security Agent shall give instructions for the purposes of this paragraph as directed
by an Instructing Group.

Each of the intra-group lenders under the Intercreditor Agreement to which Midco owes any liabilities
agrees (to the fullest extent permitted by law at the relevant time) with the Notes Security Agent that it will cast
its vote in any proposal put to the vote by, or under the supervision of, any judicial or supervisory authority in
respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating to any member of the
Midco Group other than in respect of the Shared Collateral as instructed by the Notes Security Agent. The Notes
Security Agent shall give instructions for the purposes of this paragraph as directed by the Majority Midco
Creditors.

_Waiver of Rights_

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement, each of the Secured Parties, Midco Secured Parties and the Debtors waives all rights it may
otherwise have to require that the security be enforced in any particular order or manner or at any particular time,
or that any sum received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of the enforcement of any of the security or
of any other security interest, which is capable of being applied in or towards discharge of any of the secured
obligations (including Midco Liabilities and Midco Proceeds Loan Liabilities), is so applied.

_Duties Owed_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors acknowledges that, in
the event that the Shared Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to enforce, any Shared Collateral prior to the
Senior Secured Discharge Date, the duties of the Shared Security Agent and of any receiver or delegate owed to
the creditors in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Second Lien Creditors”) in respect of the method,
type and timing of that enforcement or of the exploitation, management or realization of any of that Shared
Collateral shall (subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement) be no different to or greater than the
duty that is owed by the Shared Security Agent, receiver or delegate to the Debtors under general law. The duty
of care owed (whether under the Intercreditor Agreement or under general law) by the Shared Security Agent to
the Second Lien Creditors shall be the same whether or not the Second Lien Creditors are a creditor to the
relevant entity at which enforcement is being conducted or are beneficiaries of the security which is being
enforced. The Shared Security Agent is obliged to promptly notify the Second Lien Creditors of the scheduling
of any proceedings in relation to any Enforcement Action with respect to the Shared Collateral.

162


-----

Furthermore, each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors acknowledges that, in the event that the Shared
Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to enforce, any Shared Collateral on or after the Senior Secured
Discharge Date but prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the duties of the Shared Security Agent and of any
receiver or delegate owed to any Midco Notes finance party in respect of the method, type and timing of that
enforcement or of the exploitation, management or realization of any of that Shared Collateral shall (subject to
certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement) be no different to or greater than the duty that is owed by the
Shared Security Agent, receiver or delegate to the Debtors under general law.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Shared Collateral is held by a creditor other than the Shared Security Agent, then creditors may only
enforce that Shared Collateral in accordance with instructions given by an Instructing Group in accordance with
the provisions described in this section captioned “—Enforcement of Security” (and for this purpose references to
the Shared Security Agent shall be construed as references to that creditor).

**_Proceeds of Disposals_**

_Non-Distressed Disposals_

In this section, “Disposal Proceeds” means the proceeds of a Non-Distressed Disposal (as defined below).

If, in respect of a disposal (a “Non-Distressed Disposal”) of an (a) asset by a Debtor or (b) an asset which is
subject to the transaction security, and Bidco certifies for the benefit of the relevant Security Agent that (I) the
disposal is not prohibited under the Debt Documents and the relevant asset is not required to remain subject to
the Collateral or all required consents from creditors for such disposal have been obtained, and (II) the disposal is
not a Distressed Disposal (described below), then the relevant Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the
reasonable cost of the relevant Debtor, BidCo or MidCo and without any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) but subject to the following paragraph:

    - to release the security and any other claim (relating to a debt document) over that asset;

    - where that asset consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release the security and any other claim,
including without limitation any guarantee liabilities or other liabilities (relating to a debt document)
over that Debtor or its assets and (if any) the subsidiaries of that Debtor and their respective assets; and

    - to execute and deliver or enter into any release of the security or any claim described in the preceding
two bullets and issue any certificates of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any consent to
dealing that may be reasonably requested by Bidco.

If that Non-Distressed Disposal is not made, each release of security or any claim described in the paragraph
above shall have no effect and the security or claim subject to that release shall continue in such force and effect
as if that release had not been effected.

_Distressed Disposals_

A “Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of an asset or shares of a member of the Midco Group (other than
shares in MidCo) which is (a) being effected at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where the
Shared Collateral has become enforceable as a result of an acceleration event which was continuing at the time
the request for enforcement was made, (b) being effected by enforcement of the Shared Collateral as a result of
an acceleration event which was continuing at the time the request for enforcement was made or (c) being
disposed of to a third party subsequent to an acceleration event or the enforcement of any transaction security.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Shared Security Agent is irrevocably authorized
(at the cost of the relevant Debtor or BidCo and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation
from any creditor or Debtor):

(i) to release the Shared Collateral or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter into
any release of that Shared Collateral or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating
charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Shared Security Agent, be considered
necessary or desirable;

163


-----

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release:

(A) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities, its
guarantee liabilities and its other liabilities;

(B) any Shared Collateral granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its
assets; and

(C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Subordinated Creditor, or another Debtor over that
Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor,

on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor to
release:

(A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its
borrowing liabilities, its guarantees liabilities and its other liabilities;

(B) any Shared Collateral granted by any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets;
and

(C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor over the
assets of that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company,

on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor and the Shared Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement)
decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities or the Debtor liabilities owed by that Debtor or
holding company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company:

(A) (if the Shared Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not
intend that any transferee of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be
treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement),
to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities or
Debtor liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any debt Document, the
Transferee shall not be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) (if the Shared Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend
that any Transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of: all (and
not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors and all or part of any other liabilities
and the Debtor liabilities, on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Shared Security Agent (acting in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part
of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in
respect of: the intra-group liabilities or the Debtor liabilities, to execute and deliver or enter into any
agreement to:

(A) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or
Debtor liabilities on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those
obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
guarantor of the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the Second Lien
Lender Liabilities and the Second Lien Notes Liabilities (the “Priority Secured Liabilities”) to
accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or
Debtor liabilities on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations
in respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities are to be transferred.

164


-----

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities or Debtor
liabilities) shall be paid to the Shared Security Agent (as the case may be) for application in accordance with the
provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an
enforcement of the Shared Collateral and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities has
occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the Shared
Security Agent, the Shared Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the
prevailing market conditions (although the Shared Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any
such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to
give, and have given, instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Shared Security Agent is
not authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee
liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any
other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating
to a letter of credit or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the
relevant senior creditor), following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Midco Creditors are entitled to give,
and have given, instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Shared Security Agent is not
authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee
liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or
guarantee liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in
full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit or an ancillary facility, made the subject
of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor), following that release.

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any Senior Secured Liabilities or any Second Lien Liabilities
would otherwise be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have
those borrowing liabilities transferred to MidCo or HoldCo, in which case the Shared Security Agent is
irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or BidCo and without any consent, sanction, authority
or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer
those borrowing liabilities.

If before the first date on which all Second Lien Liabilities have been discharged (the “Second Lien
**Discharge Date”) or the first date on which all Midco Liabilities have been discharged (the “Midco Discharge**
**Date”), a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that the Second Lien Liabilities or the Midco Guarantee**
Liabilities and Shared Collateral over shares in BidCo or assets of a Midco Guarantor will be released pursuant to
the Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to the release that either:

    - the Second Lien Agent, Second Lien Notes Trustee, Midco Agent and Midco Notes Trustee (as
applicable) has approved the release; or

    - where shares or assets of a guarantor in respect of Second Lien Liabilities (a “Second Lien
**Guarantor”) or Midco Guarantor or assets of MidCo are sold:**

(A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash) and/or other marketable
securities or, if the proceeds of such sale or disposal are not in cash (or substantially in cash) and/
or other marketable securities, the requirements of paragraph (C)(III) below are satisfied;

(B) all claims of the Senior Secured Creditors and Second Lien Creditors against a member of the
Midco Group (if any), all of whose shares are pledged in favor of the creditors in respect of the
Priority Secured Liabilities (the “Priority Secured Creditors”) are sold or disposed of pursuant
to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of
concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all
security under the security documents in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is
simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided
that in the event of a sale or disposal of any such claim (instead of a release or discharge):

(I) where the Senior Secured Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Senior Agent and
Senior Secured Notes Trustee (i) determine, acting reasonably and in good faith, that the
Senior Secured Creditors will recover more than if such claim was released or discharged,
and (ii) serve a notice on the Shared Security Agent notifying the Shared Security Agent of
the same; and

165


-----

(II) where the Second Lien Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Second Lien Agent and
the Second Lien Notes Trustee (i) determine acting reasonably and in good faith that the
Priority Secured Creditors (collectively) will recover more than if such claim was released or
discharged, and (ii) serve a notice on the Shared Security Agent notifying the Shared Security
Agent of the same;

in which case the Shared Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such
claim to such purchaser (or an affiliate of such purchaser); and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

(I) pursuant to a public or private auction or other competitive process;

(II) pursuant to any process or proceedings approved or supervised by or on behalf of any court
of law where there is a determination of value by or on behalf of the court; or

(III) where an independent investment bank or an internationally recognized firm of accountants
or a reputable independent third party professional firm which is regularly engaged in
providing valuations in respect of the relevant type and size of the assets concerned selected
by the Shared Security Agent has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that
the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view, taking into
account all relevant circumstances, including the method of enforcement provided that the
liability of such investment bank or internationally recognized firm of accountants in giving
such opinion may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement.

For the purposes of the first and second bullets above and sub-clauses (iv) and (v) and the second paragraph
after sub-clause (v)(B) above, the Shared Security Agent shall act:

    - if the relevant Distressed Disposal is being effected by way of enforcement of the Shared Collateral, in
accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Manner of Enforcement—Shared
Collateral” above; and

    - in any other case, (a) on the instructions of the Instructing Group or (b) in the absence of any such
instructions, as the Shared Security Agent sees fit.

**_Application of Proceeds_**

For the purposes of this section, “Recoveries” refers, collectively, to (i) Group Recoveries (defined below)
and (ii) all amounts from time to time received or recovered by the Notes Security Agent from the Debtors
pursuant to the terms of any debt document (other than Shared Collateral or any amounts received or recovered
by or on behalf of the Midco Creditors from a Distressed Disposal of the Shared Collateral) (the “Independent
**Recoveries”).**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that Secured Parties and Midco Secured Parties may only benefit
from Recoveries (as defined above) to the extent that the liabilities of such Secured Parties and Midco Secured
Parties have the benefit of the guarantees or security under which such Recoveries are received and provided
that, in all cases, the rights of such Secured Parties and Midco Secured Parties shall in any event be subject to the
priorities set out in this section, and provided further, however, that this shall not prevent the Senior Secured
Notes Trustee from claiming and being paid the Senior Secured Notes Trustee amounts, the Second Lien Agent
from claiming and being paid the Second Lien Agent amounts, the Second Lien Notes Trustee from claiming and
being paid the Second Lien Notes Trustee amounts, the Midco Creditor Representative from claiming and being
paid the amounts owed to it by Debtors in its capacity as agent under a Midco Facility (“Midco Agent
**Liabilities”) or the Midco Notes Trustee from claiming and being paid the Midco Notes Trustee amounts. This**
shall not prevent a Senior Secured Creditor benefiting from such Group Recoveries where it was not legally
possible for the Senior Secured Creditor to obtain the relevant guarantees or security, and shall not affect the
equalization provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement described below under the caption “—Equalization”.

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that all amounts from time to time received or recovered by the
Shared Security Agent pursuant to the terms of any debt document (other than recoveries from any Notes
Collateral or any other security which is not Shared Collateral or any guarantees provided by MidCo or any other
holding company of BidCo in respect of any of the Midco Liabilities) or in connection with the realization or
enforcement of all or any part of the Shared Collateral (for the purposes of this section, the “Group Recoveries”)

and (III) above;

(D) the Second Lien Agent (for itself and for the second lien arrangers and the Second Lien Lenders),
and each Second Lien Notes Trustee (for itself and for the creditors in respect of the Second Lien
Notes), for application towards the discharge of (I) the liabilities of the arrangers of the Second
Lien Facilities and the Second Lien Lender Liabilities (in accordance with the terms of the finance
documents applicable to the Second Lien Facilities), and (II) the Second Lien Notes Liabilities (in
accordance with the terms of the finance documents applicable to the Second Lien Notes), on a
_pro rata basis and ranking pari passu between themselves. On the Issue Date, no Second Lien_
Lender Liabilities or Second Lien Notes Liabilities will be outstanding. Such Liabilities may only
be incurred if not prohibited under the terms of the Debt Documents, including, without limitation,
the covenants applicable to the Notes described under “Description of the Notes—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Layered Debt” and “Description of the Notes—Limitation on Liens.”

(E) solely to the extent such proceeds are from the realization or enforcement of all or any part of the

unsecured arrangers and the Midco Lenders), and each Midco Notes Trustee (for itself and for the
creditors in respect of the Midco Notes), for application towards the discharge of (I) the liabilities
of the arrangers of the Midco Facilities and the Midco Facility Liabilities (in accordance with the
terms of the finance documents applicable to the Midco Facilities), and (II) the Midco Notes
Liabilities (in accordance with the terms of the finance documents applicable to the Midco Notes),
on a pro rata basis and ranking pari passu between themselves.

Intercreditor Agreement or the finance documents relating to the Permitted Senior Secured

167


-----

All Independent Recoveries shall be held by the Notes Security Agent on trust, to the extent legally

permitted by applicable law (and subject to the provisions of this section), in the following order of priority:

(i) in discharging any sums owing to the Midco creditor representatives (in respect of the amounts due to
the Midco Notes Trustee, any other Midco notes trustee or an agent under a Midco Facility), the Notes
Security Agent, any receiver or delegate on a pari passu basis;

(ii) in payment of all costs and expenses incurred by any agent or Midco creditor in connection with any

(iii) the Midco Agent (for itself and for the senior unsecured arrangers and the Midco Lenders), and each
Midco Notes Trustee (for itself and for the creditors in respect of the Midco Notes), for application
towards the discharge of (I) the liabilities of the arrangers of the Midco Facilities and the Midco
Facility Liabilities (in accordance with the terms of the finance documents applicable to the Midco
Facilities), and (II) the Midco Notes Liabilities (in accordance with the terms of the finance documents
applicable to the Midco Notes), on a pro rata basis and ranking pari passu between themselves;

(iv) if none of the Debtors is under any further actual or contingent liability under any of the Intercreditor
Agreement or the finance documents relating to the Midco Liabilities, in payment to any other person
whom the Notes Security Agent is obliged to pay in priority to any Debtor; and

(v) the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Debtor.

**_Equalization_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason, any Senior Secured Liabilities remain
unpaid after the first date on which Enforcement Action is taken (under the second, fourth, fifth or fourteenth
bullets of such definition as described in this summary) (the “Enforcement Date”) and the resulting losses are
not borne by the Senior Secured Creditors in the proportions which their respective exposures at the Enforcement
Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the Senior Secured Creditors at the Enforcement Date, the Senior
Secured Creditors (subject, in the case of amounts owing to the trustees of the Senior Secured Notes, Second
Lien Notes and Midco Notes, to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) will make such payments amongst
themselves as the Shared Security Agent shall require to put the Senior Secured Creditors in such a position that
(after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions.

**_New Debt Financing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement permits, in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, for the
implementation of any existing, additional, supplemental or new financing arrangement under a Senior Secured
Finance Document, a Second Lien Finance Document or a Midco Finance Document, including by way of
refinancing, replacement, exchange, set-off, discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional,
supplemental or new financing arrangement under such finance documents (a “New Debt Financing”). In
connection with any New Debt Financing, each Debtor and each Security Agent is authorized to enter into any
new security document, amend or waive any term of an existing security document and/or release any asset from
the Collateral subject to certain conditions, including as regards the parties in whose favor such security is
granted, and the terms of such security (which must be substantially the same as the terms applicable to the
existing Collateral). In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement permits, subject to the terms of the other Debt
Documents, the incurrence of indebtedness which has super priority status in respect of the proceeds from the
enforcement of collateral compared with other senior indebtedness.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or
waived only with the consent of BidCo, the relevant agents (including the Senior Agent), and the Security Agent,
provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class of creditors, and such
amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected materially or adversely to affect the interests of
the other classes of creditors, only written agreement from the agent acting on behalf of the affected class shall be
required.

168


-----

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates to,
among other matters, the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” and the order of
priority or subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent of:

(i) the agents (including the Senior Agent);

(ii) the Senior Lenders;

(iii) the Senior Secured Notes creditors (to the extent that the amendment or waiver would materially and
adversely affect such creditors);

(iv) the Second Lien Lenders, if any;

(v) the Second Lien Notes creditors (to the extent that the amendment or waiver would materially and
adversely affect such creditors), if any;

(vi) the Midco Lenders;

affect such creditors);

(v) each hedge counterparty (to the extent that the amendment or waiver would adversely affect the hedge
counterparty);

(vi) each Security Agent; and

(vii) BidCo and MidCo.

The Intercreditor Agreement may be amended by the Agents, each Security Agent and BidCo without the
consent of any other party thereto, to cure defects, omissions or manifest errors or resolve ambiguities or
inconsistencies.

Each agent shall, to the extent consented to by the requisite percentage of creditors it represents or is
otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such instructions or authorizations in
accordance therewith save to the extent any amendments so consented or authorized to relate to any provision
affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent in its capacity as such.

_Amendments and Waivers: Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, the relevant Security Agent may, if
authorized by an Instructing Group in the case of the Shared Collateral or the Majority Midco Creditors in the
case of the Notes Collateral, and if BidCo consents, amend the terms of, waive any of the requirements of or
grant consents under, any of the security documents which shall be binding on each party.

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, the prior consent of the Primary Creditors
is required to authorize any amendment or waiver of, or consent under, any security document governing the
Shared Collateral which would adversely affect the nature or scope of the charged property or the manner in
which the proceeds of enforcement of the Shared Collateral are distributed.

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, the prior consent of the Midco Creditors is
required to authorize any amendment or waiver of, or consent under, any security document governing the Notes
Collateral which would adversely affect the nature or scope of the charged property or the manner in which the
proceeds of enforcement of the Notes Collateral are distributed.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below and certain other exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, an
amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or obligations which are personal to an Agent, an
arranger, a Security Agent in its capacity as such (including, without limitation, any ability of that Security Agent
to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement) may not be effected without the consent of that Agent
or, as the case may be, that arranger or the relevant Security Agent.

169


-----

Neither of the preceding paragraph nor the first paragraph of the section above captioned “— Amendments
and Waivers: Security Documents” shall apply:

    - to any release of security, claim or liabilities; or

    - to any consent,

which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions set out in the caption “—
Proceeds of Disposals” above and the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to New Debt Financing.

_Snooze/Lose_

If in relation to a request for a consent, a request to participate in a vote of a class of creditors, a request to
approve any action or a request for a confirmation or notification, in each case, under the Intercreditor
Agreement, a Primary Creditor fails to respond to the request within 10 Business Days (or any other period of
time notified by BidCo, with agreement of the Senior Agent if a shorter period of time) or fails to provide details
of its credit participation, such Primary Creditor will be disregarded or be deemed to have zero participation or
outstandings in respect of the matter or be deemed to have provided the relevant confirmation or notification, as
applicable.

_Agreement to Override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides
anything in the debt documents to the contrary.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Intercreditor Agreement, the paragraph above will not cure,
postpone, waive or negate any default or event of default (however described) under any Debt Document (or any
event that would but for the paragraph above constitute a breach, default or event of default (however described))
as between any creditor and any Debtor that are party to that Debt Document.

**Local Credit Lines**

**_Argentina Line of Credit_**

Our subsidiary in Argentina requested a financing facility in May 2013 with Banco Itau´ Argentina S.A., for
1.2 million Argentine pesos of credit at a fixed rate of interest of 15.25%. The facility requires us to make
repayments of 50,000 Argentine pesos each month, which will result in all amounts being repaid by July 2016.
Terms of the facility include a change of control provision, which we expect will entitle the counterparty to
terminate the facility upon the Completion Date. As of September 30, 2014, €0.1 million (equivalent) was
outstanding under this facility.

**_Austria Export Credit Agreement_**

Wittur Austria GmbH is party to a subsidized export credit agreement with UniCredit Bank Austria AG for
a line of credit up to 10% of sales (equivalent to €9.3 million as of September 30, 2014) in respect of receivables
for exported goods at a margin of 1.25% per annum. The line of credit is repayable upon demand and terminable
by either party at any time. The line of credit is guaranteed by Wittur GmbH and Wittur Austria Holdings GmbH,
and also benefits from a guarantee by Oesterreichische Kontrollbank Aktiengesellschaft, which manages the
Austrian government’s export guarantee system. As of September 30, 2014, €4.0 million was outstanding under
this export credit agreement. Additionally, Wittur Austria GmbH undertook to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of
4:1 or less.

**_China Banking Relationships_**

We have entered into relationship agreements with three banks in China. These relationship agreements
provide for local lines of credit which are subject to application by us and approval by each bank, and so the
amounts under each of these relationship agreements do not represent committed funds available for use. On
March 20, 2014, China Construction Bank extended a RMB60.0 million annual line of credit to our subsidiary in
China (“Wittur China”), which provided for availability of up to RMB20.0 million to finance working capital,
RMB20.0 million for bank acceptance bills and RMB20.0 million for domestic factoring. The Bank of China has
agreed to a RMB60.0 million annual line of credit to Wittur China, and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China has extended a RMB40.0 million annual line of credit to finance working capital. To access capital
available under any of these lines of credit, Wittur China would need to apply for a loan and be approved by the
bank providing the credit. As of September 30, 2014, we had not utilized any of these lines of credit.

**_India Working Capital Line_**

Wittur Elevator Components India Pvt. Ltd. is the borrower under a working capital line with Corporation
Bank, Chennai Sriperumpudur Branch, consisting of a rupee 40.0 million cash credit facility, with a rupee
2.5 million sublimit for receivables finance, and a rupee 2.0 million bank guarantee letter of credit arrangement.
Using current exchange rates, total availability under the working capital line would be approximately €0.6
million. The working capital line is repayable upon demand, terminable by either party at any time and subject to
annual renewal. The working capital line is secured by the inventory, book debts and other current assets of
borrower, and accrues interest on outstanding balances at the base rate of the Reserve Bank of India, plus
4.60% per annum. As of September 30, 2014, €0.5 million (equivalent) was outstanding under this working
capital line.

**_Turkey General Loan Agreement_**

Wittur Asansör Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim S¸irketi is the borrower under a general loan agreement with a
export loan credit line of TRY 4,500,000 and an interest rate of 2.95% which may be changed by the bank at its
sole discretion. This general loan was used by the borrower as an export loan. As of September 30, 2014, the
equivalent of €1.0 million was outstanding under this general loan agreement. The outstanding amount of the
loan is to be repaid on May 15, 2015, if not rolled over for a subsequent one year term. The loan is unsecured.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” under the
heading “Certain Definitions.” For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Issuer,” “we,”
“our,” and “us” refer only to Paternoster Holding III GmbH.

The Issuer will issue €200.0 million aggregate principal amount of its % Senior Notes due 2023 (the
“Notes”) under an indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (the “Indenture”), between, inter alios, the Issuer,
Holdco, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as security agent in
respect of the First-Priority Collateral (as defined below) (the “Notes Security Agent”), Credit Suisse AG, London
Branch, as security agent in respect of the Shared Collateral (as defined below) (the “Shared Security Agent”, and
together with the Notes Security Agent, the “Security Agents”) and Elavon Financial Services Limited, UK
Branch, as paying agent, in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. The Indenture will not incorporate or include terms of, or be subject to, any of the provisions of,
the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer, together with the
proceeds of the First Lien Term Loan, the Equity Contribution and cash on hand, to (i) fund the consideration
payable for the shares of the Target, (ii) repay all amounts outstanding under the Existing Senior Facilities
Agreement and (iii) pay the estimated fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, including
commitment, placement, financial advisory and other transaction costs and professional fees, as set forth in this
Offering Memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds.” Pending consummation of the Acquisition and the
satisfaction of certain other conditions as described below, the initial purchasers will, concurrently with the
closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, deposit the gross proceeds of this offering of the Notes into
an escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) pursuant to the terms of an escrow deed (the “Escrow Agreement”)
dated as of the Issue Date, among the Issuer, the Trustee and Elavon Financial Services Limited, UK Branch, as
escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”). If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to September 30, 2015
(the “Escrow Longstop Date”), the Notes will be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of
the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below). See “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”
Following the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by the Collateral (as defined under “—Security”). See “—
_Security.”_

Upon the initial issuance of the Notes, the Notes will only be obligations of the Issuer and Paternoster
Holding IV GmbH (the “Issue Date Guarantor”) and will not be guaranteed by Wittur International Holding
GmbH (the “Target”) or any of its Subsidiaries. Assuming the Completion Date occurs on or prior to the Escrow
Longstop Date and the escrowed funds are released from the Escrow Account, the Target and certain of its
Subsidiaries will become a party to the Indenture and will guarantee the Notes on a senior subordinated basis
within 90 days of the Completion Date (such date, the “Post-Completion Date”). Prior to the Completion Date,
we will not control the Target or any of its Subsidiaries, and none of the Target or any of its Subsidiaries will be
subject to the covenants described in this “Description of the Notes.” As such, we cannot assure you that prior to
the Post-Completion Date, the Target and its Subsidiaries will not engage in activities that would otherwise have
been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such entities after the Issue Date and
prior to such entity becoming party to the Indenture.

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €200.0 million aggregate principal
amount of Notes will be issued in this offering. We may, subject to applicable law, issue an unlimited principal
amount of additional Notes having identical terms and conditions as the Notes (the “Additional Notes”). We will
only be permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture,
including the covenants restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the Incurrence of Liens (as described
below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Liens”). Except as otherwise provided for in the Indenture, the Notes issued in this offering and, if issued, any_
Additional Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without
limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context
otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Notes” include the Notes and any
Additional Notes that are actually issued.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding relative
ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for

172

undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security
and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agents. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the_
Intercreditor Agreement.

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes, the
Indenture and the Security Documents. Since this description of the terms of the Notes is only a summary, you
should refer to the Notes, the Indenture and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations
of the Issuer and your rights. Copies of such documents are available from us upon request.

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders
will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of
other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and are subject to
certain transfer restrictions.

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Notes Guarantees**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will, upon issuance:

    - be general, senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

    - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the
value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness, including Indebtedness and other
obligations under the Senior Facilities;

    - be guaranteed by the Issue Date Guarantor and, within 90 days of the Completion Date, by the Target
and certain of its Subsidiaries on a senior subordinated basis;

    - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer that
are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors;

    - mature on, 2023; and

    - be represented by one or more registered Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances may be
represented by Definitive Registered Notes (see “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form”).

**_The Notes Guarantees_**

The Notes will be guaranteed by the Issue Date Guarantor on the Issue Date (the “Issue Date Guarantee”)
and by the Target and certain of its Subsidiaries within 90 days of the Completion Date. In addition, if required
by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees,” certain other Restricted
Subsidiaries may provide a Notes Guarantee in the future.

The Issue Date Guarantee will, as of the Issue Date:

    - be a senior subordinated obligation of the Issue Date Guarantor, secured as set forth under
“—Security”;

    - be subordinated in right of payment to the Issue Date Guarantor’s obligations in respect of any existing
and future Senior Indebtedness, including the Issue Date Guarantor’s obligations under the Senior
Facilities Agreement;

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior subordinated obligations of the
Issue Date Guarantor that are not subordinated to the Issue Date Guarantee;

    - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issue Date Guarantor that
is expressly subordinated to the Issue Date Guarantee; and

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the Issue Date
Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Issue Date Guarantee, to the
extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness.

173


-----

The Notes Guarantee of the Target and certain of its Subsidiaries granted after the Completion Date will
each:

    - be a general senior subordinated obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

    - be subordinated in right of payment to that Guarantor’s obligations in respect of any existing and future
Senior Indebtedness, including that Guarantor’s obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement;

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior subordinated obligations of that
Guarantor that are not subordinated to such Notes Guarantee;

    - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is
expressly subordinated to such Notes Guarantee;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such Guarantor that
is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Notes Guarantee, to the extent of the value of
the property and assets securing such Indebtedness; and

    - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness, including obligations to trade
creditors, of the Subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant
Notes Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance or infringement of
capital maintenance rules under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law or as set
out in the respective Guarantee or Security Documents. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation
under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a
Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes and Our Structure—Each Guarantee and the security interests in the Collateral will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its_
_validity and enforceability.” The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the liability of each_
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain Limitations on the Validity and the
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for the purposes of the
Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted
_Subsidiary,” we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Our_
Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not
guarantee the Notes.

As of September 30, 2014, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and its consolidated
Subsidiaries would have had €420.0 million of third party financial Indebtedness (excluding finance leases),
€200.0 million of which is represented by the Notes and €220.0 million of which is represented by borrowings
under the Senior Facilities Agreement. In addition, there would have been €65.0 million available for drawing
under the Revolving Credit Facility.

**Subordination of the Notes Guarantees on the Basis of the Intercreditor Agreement**

The Notes Guarantees are senior subordinated indebtedness of the Guarantors, which means that, pursuant
to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes Guarantees (as defined below) rank behind, and are
expressly subordinated to, all the existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors, including any
obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement. The ability to take enforcement action against the Guarantors
is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement and the terms of the Notes, and
potentially any Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date. Because of the foregoing
subordination provision, it is likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness and other creditors (including trade
creditors) of the Guarantors would recover disproportionately more than the holders of the Notes recover in any
insolvency or similar proceeding relating to such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or no
assets, remaining to pay the principal of or interest on the Notes.

**Principal and Maturity**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Notes
will mature on, 2023. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

174


-----

**Interest**

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum. Interest on the Notes will:

    - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid;

    - be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on the and, except for the first interest
payment, which shall be payable on October 15, 2015;

    - be payable to the holder of record of such Notes on the and immediately preceding the related
interest payment date, except in respect of the first interest payment, which shall be paid to the holder
of record of such Notes on October 1, 2015; and

    - be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures
of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at
the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the
amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest
or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes_**

Principal, interest and premium, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) will be payable at the
specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided that all such payments with respect to the
Notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered in the name of or held by a nominee of a common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
_Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained for_
such purposes in the City of London. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by
check mailed to the person entitled thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See
“—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes.”

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes in the City of London (including the
Principal Paying Agent). The Issuer will also undertake to maintain a Paying Agent in a European Union member
state that will not be obligated to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the European Union Directive 2003/48/EC
or any other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN meeting of 26 and 27 November 2000
regarding the taxation of savings income (the “Directive”), or any law implementing or complying with or
introduced in order to conform to, such Directive. The initial Paying Agent will be Elavon Financial Services
Limited, UK Branch (the “Principal Paying Agent”).

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) in Ireland, and a transfer agent (the “Transfer
_Agent”) in the City of London. The initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services Limited and the initial_
Transfer Agent will be Elavon Financial Services Limited, UK Branch. The Registrar, Transfer Agent and
Paying Agent, as applicable, will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to
time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agents, Registrars or Transfer Agents for the Notes without prior notice
to the Holders of such Notes. However, for so long as Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules
of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or
Transfer Agent on the official website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie), to the extent and in the manner
permitted by the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange. Such notice of the change in a Paying Agent, Registrar or
Transfer Agent may instead be published in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Ireland (which is
expected to be the Irish Times). The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in
respect of the Notes.

**The Notes Guarantees**

**_General_**

The obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes, including any payment obligation resulting from a
Change of Control, will (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) be guaranteed, jointly and severally on a
senior subordinated basis, on the Issue Date by the Issue Date Guarantor and, within 90 days of the Completion
Date, by the Target and the Target’s Subsidiaries that will be guarantors under the Senior Facilities (each, a “Post
_Completion Guarantor” and, together with the Issue Date Guarantor, the “Guarantors,” and any such guarantee_
of any Guarantor, a “Notes Guarantee”).

The initial Guarantors, the type of Notes Guarantee and their respective jurisdictions of incorporation will
be as follows:

Guarantor Type of Guarantee Jurisdiction

Wittur GmbH . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Post Completion Guarantee Austria
Wittur Austria Holding GmbH . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Post Completion Guarantee Austria

Wittur Italia Holding s.r.l. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Post Completion Guarantee Italy
Wittur S.p.A. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Post Completion Guarantee Italy

Wittur Sweden AB . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Post Completion Guarantee Sweden
Wittur Asansör San. ve Tic. A.S. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Post Completion Guarantee Turkey

In addition, as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, the Target and certain of its Subsidiaries that in the
future guarantee the Senior Facilities or certain other Indebtedness permitted under the Indenture in the future
shall also enter into a supplemental indenture to become a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations
under the Senior Facilities and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of
guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal
limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin
capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time
and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the holders of the Notes.

Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the applicable
Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United
States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the
Agreed Security Principles, to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance, capital maintenance rules and
other laws or will be limited as set out in the respective Guarantee. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s
obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes,
or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to the Notes and Our Structure—Each Guarantee and the security interests in the Collateral will be subject to_
_certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may_
_limit its validity and enforceability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—Local_
_insolvency laws may not be as favorable to you as insolvency laws of jurisdictions with which you may be_
_familiar and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes.” For example, the_
Guarantees by our Italian subsidiaries, Wittur Italia Holding s.r.l. and Wittur S.p.A., are expected to be limited to
€5.0 million and €1.0 million, respectively (based on a Completion Date of March 31, 2015). The limitation of
the Italian Guarantees will be calculated as a percentage of the intercompany proceeds loans used to refinance
existing indebtedness of our Italian subsidiaries and could be higher or lower, depending on the amount of
outstanding local debt on the actual Completion Date. In addition, the Guarantee provided by Wittur Asanso¨r
San. V Tic. A.S., our subsidiary in Turkey, will be capped at €2.5 million. However, we cannot provide any
assurances that holders of the Notes will be able to recover even these amounts under such Guarantees, as

176


-----

payment under each Guarantee is contractually subordinated to all the senior indebtedness of such Guarantor,
including such Guarantor’s obligations under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations.

A portion of the operations of the Issuer and the Target will be conducted through their Restricted
Subsidiaries that will not be Guarantors. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including
trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of
preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of nonGuarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of
those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of
the Notes. The Notes and each Notes Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including
trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the
Guarantors) and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any).

As of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, the Post Completion Guarantors accounted for 64% of the
consolidated gross assets (excluding goodwill and certain other intangible assets resulting from the purchase
price allocation of our acquisition by Triton in 2010 which cannot be allocated to individual subsidiaries), 50% of
the consolidated net sales and 60% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Group. After giving pro forma effect to
the Transactions, as of September 30, 2014, the Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries would have had no third
party financial Indebtedness (excluding finance leases) of Subsidiaries other than the Issuer and the Guarantors.
Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of
Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture
will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Indebtedness.”_

**_Notes Guarantees Release_**
The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release upon:

    - a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the
relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company), or the sale or disposition of
all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), if
the sale or other disposition does not violate the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as a result of the sale or other disposition;

    - the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

    - legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes in accordance with the
Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

    - so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, upon release of the Guarantee under any
Indebtedness that triggered such Guarantor’s obligation to guarantee the Notes under the covenant
described in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees”;

    - in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

    - as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

    - as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees”; or_

    - as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The
_Guarantors.”_
At the request and expense of the Issuer, the Trustee, subject to the receipt of certain documentation, shall
take all reasonably necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in
accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set
forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without any additional consent of the Holders or any other action or
consent on the part of the Trustee.

**Transfer and Exchange**
The Notes will be issued in the form of registered notes in global form without interest coupons, as follows:

    - Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date,
be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts
of Euroclear and Clearstream.

177


-----

    - Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The
Regulation S Global Note will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
_Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in_
Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the
applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes denominated in the same currency only upon
delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such
transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of
instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It
is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes
issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined
by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the
restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be
transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in principal amount and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture
will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and
transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream,
where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such
transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any
Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the transfer
or exchange of any Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in
part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the
registered Holder of a Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

178


-----

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

Immediately after the issuance of the Notes, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries.
However, in the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the
Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

If the Issue Date occurs prior to the Completion Date, then, concurrently with the closing of this offering of
Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into the Escrow Agreement with the Trustee and the Escrow Agent,
pursuant to which the initial purchasers will deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount equal to the gross
proceeds of this offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow Account. The Escrow Account will
be pledged on a first-priority basis in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, pursuant to
an escrow account charge dated the Issue Date between the Issuer and the Trustee (the “Escrow Charge”). The
initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions
and other property and payments credited to the Escrow Account (less any property and/or funds paid in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement) are referred to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.”

In order to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property to the Issuer (the “Release”), the
Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall have received from the Issuer, at a time that is on or before the Escrow
Longstop Date, an Officer’s Certificate, upon which both the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall conclusively
rely, without further investigation or liability, to the effect that:

    - the Acquisition will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Acquisition Agreement, promptly
following release of the Escrowed Property, except for any changes or other modifications that will not,
individually or when taken as whole, have a material adverse effect on the holders of the Notes;

    - immediately after consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will own, directly or indirectly, the
entire share capital of the Target; and

    - as of the Completion Date, there is no Default or Event of Default under clause (6) of the first
paragraph under the heading titled “Events of Default” below.

The Release shall occur promptly upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth above (the date of such
satisfaction, the “Completion Date”). Upon the Release, the Escrow Account shall be reduced to zero, and the
Escrowed Property shall be paid out in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

In the event that (a) the Completion Date does not take place on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (b) in
the reasonable judgment of the Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated by the Escrow Longstop Date,
(c) the Acquisition Agreement terminates at any time prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, (d) the Initial Investors
cease to beneficially own and control a majority of the issued and outstanding Capital Stock of the Issuer or (e) a
Default or Event of Default arises under clause (6) of the first paragraph under the heading titled “Events of
Default” below on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date (the date of any such event being the “Special
_Termination Date”), the Issuer will redeem all of the Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the_
“Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes, plus accrued
but unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory Redemption
Date (as defined below) (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date).

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Issuer, no later than one Business Day
following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, and will provide that the Notes
shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the fifth Business Day after such notice is given by the Issuer in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”). On the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Principal Paying Agent for payment to each
Holder the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Notes and, concurrently with the payment to
such Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if any) to the Issuer.

In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory
Redemption exceeds the amount of the Escrowed Property, Bain Capital Europe Fund IV, L.P. will be required to
make an equity contribution to the Issuer in an amount required to enable the Issuer to pay the accrued and
unpaid interest, plus Additional Amounts, if any, owing to the Holders of the Notes, pursuant to an agreement

179


-----

between Bain Capital Europe Fund IV, L.P. and the Trustee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Transactions—If the conditions to the escrow are not satisfied, the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes,_
_which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes.”_

To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, the Issuer will grant to the Trustee for
the benefit of the Holders of the Notes a security interest over the Escrow Account. Receipt by the Trustee of
either an Officer’s Certificate for the release or a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption (provided funds
sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price are in the Escrow Account) shall constitute deemed
consent by the Trustee for the release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Charge.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and
the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Irish Stock Exchange that the Special
Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such special mandatory redemption.

**Security**

**_General_**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees in respect thereof will be secured:

    - on the Issue Date, by first-ranking security interests in the Escrowed Property, if any;

    - on or within five Business Days of the Issue Date, by first-priority security interests in (i) all issued
Capital Stock of the Issuer and (ii) all bank accounts of the Issuer, if any (collectively and together with
any security interests in the Escrowed Property, the “First-Priority Collateral”); and

    - on or within five Business Days of the Issue Date, by second-priority security interests in (i) all issued
Capital Stock of the Issue Date Guarantor, (ii) the intercompany loan receivable in respect of the
proceeds of the Notes due to the Issuer from the Issue Date Guarantor, (iii) all bank accounts of the
Issue Date Guarantor, if any, and (iv) certain rights and claims of the Issue Date Guarantor under the
Acquisition Agreement (collectively, the “Shared Collateral” and, together with the First-Priority
Collateral, the “Collateral”).

The assets that comprise the Shared Collateral, together with certain other property and assets of the Target
and its Subsidiaries, will also secure on a first-priority basis the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer will be_
permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness or
Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including Additional Notes, as permitted under the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The First-Priority Collateral will be pledged or assigned pursuant to the Security Documents to the Notes
Security Agent on behalf of the Holders of the Notes. The Shared Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the
Security Documents to the Shared Security Agent on behalf of the Holders of the Notes and holders of the other
secured obligations that we secured by the Shared Collateral. Any other security interests that may in the future
be granted to secure obligations under the Notes, any Notes Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute
“Collateral.” All Collateral will be subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted
Collateral Liens.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or
imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to
fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain Limitations on the
_Validity and the Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations.”_

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” certain property, rights and assets (other than the Collateral described in the_
first and second paragraphs of this section) may not be pledged or assigned, and any pledge or assignment over

180


-----

property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security
Principles. The following is a summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles:

    - general legal and statutory limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit,
fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, retention of title claims and similar principles may limit
the ability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) to provide a
guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be limited by an amount or
otherwise. If any such limit applies, the guarantees and security provided will be limited to the
maximum amount, which the relevant member of the Group may provide having regard to applicable
law (including any jurisprudence) and subject to fiduciary duties of management. The relevant
Guarantor will use reasonable endeavors to assist in demonstrating that adequate corporate benefit
accrues to each Guarantor or security provider;

    - the giving of a guarantee, the granting and the terms of security or the perfection of the security granted
will not be required to the extent that it would incur any legal fees, registration fees, stamp duty, taxes
and any other fees or costs directly associated with such security or guarantee which are
disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the creditors;

    - where there is material incremental cost involved in creating security over all assets owned by a
member of the Group in a particular category (e.g., real estate) the principle stated above shall apply
and, subject to these Agreed Security Principles, only the material assets in that category (e.g., material
real estate) shall be subject to security;

    - in certain jurisdictions it may be either impossible or impractical to grant guarantees or create security
over certain categories of assets in which event such guarantees will not be granted and security will
not be taken over such assets;

    - any assets subject to third party arrangements which prevent those assets from being granted as
Collateral will be excluded from any relevant Security Document; provided that, if the relevant asset is
material and the relevant member of the Group determines (acting in good faith) that such endeavors
will not jeopardize commercial relationships with third parties, the relevant member of the Group will
use reasonable endeavours to obtain any necessary consent or waiver;

    - members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into Security Documents if it is
not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if, in the reasonable opinion of
legal counsel to the directors of the relevant members of the Group, the same would conflict with the
fiduciary duties of those directors or contravene any applicable legal or regulatory prohibition or result
in personal or criminal liability on the part of any officer or result in any significant risk of legal
liability for the directors of any member of the Group;

    - additional guarantee limitation provisions may be included in any supplemental indenture if required
by any officer of any member of the Group in connection with the accession of that member of the
Group as a Guarantor in order to protect that officer from potential liability or other legal risk;

    - the terms of the security should not be such that they are unduly burdensome or materially restrict the
running of the business and will be limited to those required by local law to create or perfect security
and will not impose commercial obligations;

    - information, such as lists of assets, will be provided if, and only to the extent, required by local law and
local market practice to be provided to perfect or register the relevant security interests and, unless
required to be provided by local law or local market practice more frequently, will be provided
annually;

    - the perfection of security interests granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse
effect on the ability of the relevant Guarantor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary
course as otherwise permitted by the relevant finance documents;

    - no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where the Issuer or a Guarantor is not located; and

    - pledges over shares in joint ventures or the assets owned by such joint venture vehicles will not be
required (other than in respect of intra-group joint ventures.

As described above, all of the Shared Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Senior Facilities as
well as certain Hedging Obligations and may also secure certain future Indebtedness on a first-priority basis. The

181


-----

proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after all first-priority obligations have been satisfied may not be
sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the Notes.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this Offering of the Notes. By its nature,
some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly,
the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_the Notes and Our Structure—It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the_
_Guarantees.”_

**_The Proceeds Loans_**

On the Completion Date, the Issuer will loan the proceeds of the offering of Notes issued on the Issue Date
to the Issue Date Guarantor (the “Notes Proceeds Loan”) pursuant to a proceeds loan agreement (the “Notes
_Proceeds Loan Agreement”). The Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement will provide that the Issue Date Guarantor_
will pay to the Issuer interest and principal as it becomes payable on the Notes (including any additional amounts
due thereunder). The Notes Proceeds Loan will bear interest at a rate at least equal to the interest rate of the
Notes and interest on the Notes Proceeds Loan will be payable semi-annually in arrears at least one, and no more
than five, Business Days prior to the corresponding interest payment under the Notes. Principal payments of the
Notes Proceeds Loan will be payable at least one, and no more than five, Business Days prior to a corresponding
payment of the Issuer to redeem or defease the Notes or as consideration payable under a Change of Control
Offer or Asset Disposition Offer (each as defined below), each in accordance with the Indenture. The Issue Date
Guarantor will on-lend a portion of the Notes Proceeds Loan to certain of its Subsidiaries to repay Indebtedness
of those Subsidiaries. The terms of the Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement and the agreement governing such onlending of portions of the Notes Proceeds Loan will permit the prepayment of all such loans in whole or in part at
any time. As a result, the initial amount of the Notes Proceeds Loan and such on-lending may be reduced,
potentially to zero, prior to the maturity of the Notes.

Payments by the Issue Date Guarantor and any subsequent borrower under the Notes Proceeds Loan will be
subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” The Notes Proceeds Loan will be pledged on a second-priority basis_
to secure the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees.

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under the Senior
Facilities, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, (c) the Trustee, the Agents and the Holders
of the Notes under the Indenture and (d) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness permitted to be secured by the
Collateral, respectively, will be established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture, the Senior
Facilities Agreement and the Security Documents. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreements or Additional Intercreditor_
Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See “—
_Release of Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Definitions—_
_Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, HoldCo and the Issuer will grant security over the First-Priority Collateral
to secure the payment when due, of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Notes, the
Notes Guarantees and the Indenture, and the Issuer and the Issue Date Guarantor will grant security over the
Shared Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under
the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations, on a first-priority basis, and the Notes, the Notes
Guarantees and the Indenture on a second-priority basis. The Security Documents will be entered into by the
relevant security provider and the relevant Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into the
Security Documents, the relevant Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured
parties (including itself, the Trustee and the holders of Notes from time to time). Under the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Shared Security Agent will also act as an agent of the lenders under the Senior Facilities and the
counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created in favor of such
parties.

182


-----

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable laws,
only the relevant Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee
and the holders of the Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders of the Notes will not be
entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee
under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the relevant
Security Agent for the Collateral.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the
Collateral until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security
Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided
under “—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the
Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the
Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security
Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any
amounts under the Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure.”

**_Enforcement of Security Interest; Limitations_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to
enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security
Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement and
certain hedging counterparties. In general, the rights of the Shared Security Agent (acting on its behalf or on
behalf of the Holders of the Notes) to take enforcement action under the Security Documents in respect of the
Shared Collateral are subject to certain standstill and payment blockage provisions and other limitations on
enforcement. These limitations are described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Limitations on the Validity and the Enforceability of the Guarantees and_
_the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” The ability to enforce may also be restricted_
by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Senior Facilities, the counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations secured by the
Collateral and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, appointed each
Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant security documents securing
such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents. The creditors under the Senior Facilities, the
counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Note,
each Holder will be deemed to have, authorized the Security Agents to (i) perform the duties and exercise the
rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security
documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and
(ii) execute each relevant Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement
expressed to be executed by the Security Agents on its behalf.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of
the Holders of the Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to give effect to the provisions described in
the section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to
have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agents and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Security Documents; and

183


-----

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agents and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the
Security Documents.

See the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—The security
_interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agents rather than directly to the holders of the Notes,_
_and the ability of the Security Agents to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law” and_
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

The Issuer and its Subsidiaries will be entitled to release the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral
under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under_
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or is otherwise permitted in
accordance with the Indenture or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary (including any transaction subject to
“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”; provided that this clause 1(b) shall not be relied
upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or of accounts receivable (including intercompany loan
receivables and hedging receivables) to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a Receivables Subsidiary)
unless the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to a Lien in
favor of the Notes following such transfer, sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal defeasance,
covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and
“—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of
such Unrestricted Subsidiary; or

(6) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”

At the request of the Issuer or the relevant pledgor, the relevant Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if
required) will take all necessary action required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the
Notes Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above
shall be effected by the relevant Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of
the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release).

**Optional Redemption**

Except as described below and except as described under “Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the Notes are
not redeemable until, 2018. On and after, 2018, the Issuer may redeem all or, from
time to time, part of the Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the following redemption
prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts
(as defined below), if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of

184

record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed
during the twelve-month period beginning on of the years indicated below:

Prior to, 2018, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the original
principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture (including the original principal amount of any
Additional Notes), upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, with funds in an aggregate amount not
exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price of % of the
principal amount of the Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to,
but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided that:

(1) at least 60% of the original principal amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount of
any Additional Notes) issued under the Indenture remain outstanding after each such redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

In addition, prior to, 2018, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Notes
upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
of the Notes, plus the Applicable Premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to,
but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

“Applicable Premium” means, with respect to any Note the greater of:

(a) 1% of the principal amount of such Note; and

(b) the excess (to the extent positive) of:

(i) the present value at such redemption date of (1) the redemption price of such Note at,
2018 (such redemption price (expressed in percentage of principal amount) being set forth in the
table above under the first paragraph of this section (excluding accrued and unpaid interest)), plus
(2) all required interest payments due on such Note to and including, 2018 (excluding
accrued but unpaid interest), computed upon the redemption date using a discount rate equal to the
Bund Rate at such redemption date plus 50 basis points; over

(ii) the outstanding principal amount of such Note,

as calculated by the Issuer or on behalf of the Issuer by such Person as the Issuer shall designate.

For the avoidance of doubt, calculation of Applicable Premium shall not be an obligation or duty of the
Trustee or any Paying Agent.

“Bund Rate” as selected by the Issuer, means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of direct
obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany (Bunds or Bundesanleihen) with a constant maturity (as
officially compiled and published in the most recent financial statistics that has become publicly available at least
two Business Days (but not more than five Business Days) prior to the redemption date (or, if such financial
statistics are not so published or available, any publicly available source of similar market data selected in good
faith by the Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management of the Issuer) most nearly equal to the period
from the redemption date to, 2018; provided, however, that if the period from the redemption date to
, 2018, is not equal to the constant maturity of a direct obligation of the Federal Republic of
Germany for which a weekly average yield is given, the Bund Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation
(calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of direct obligations of the
Federal Republic of Germany for which such yields are given, except that if the period from such redemption
date to, 2018, is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded direct obligations of
the Federal Republic of Germany adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.

Any such redemption and notice may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent.

185


-----

**_General_**

We may repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish
Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, inform the Irish Stock Exchange of such
optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that will remain outstanding
immediately after such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at
the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will
be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

In connection with any redemption of Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity Offering), any
such redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent.

**Sinking Fund**

Other than a Special Mandatory Redemption, the Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption
payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

**Redemption at Maturity**

On, 2023, the Issuer will redeem the Notes that have not been previously redeemed or
purchased and cancelled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and
Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent or the
Registrar will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form as
discussed under “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form,” based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata
selection as the relevant clearing system deems fair and appropriate), unless otherwise required by law or
applicable stock exchange or depository requirements. Neither the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent nor the
Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so
require, the Issuer shall publish notice of redemption in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Ireland
(which is expected to be the Irish Times) and in addition to such publication, not less than 10 nor more than
60 days prior to the redemption date, mail such notice to Holders by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their
respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar. Such notice of redemption may
instead be published on the website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie).

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new
Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered
Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original
Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Global
Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to
the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for
redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for
redemption.

186


-----

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date
fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below
under “—Withholding Taxes”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a
result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of such
laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a court of
competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a
“Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required
to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving
rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without
the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures
available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this
would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the
Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Tax Jurisdiction became a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction on a date after the
Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such
Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor
Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a change or amendments
occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be
given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment
of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant to the
foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such
redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem
have been satisfied and that it cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable
measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing and reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Issuer has been
or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept
and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of
the conditions precedent described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive
and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a
“Payor”) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and
clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or
deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes
imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note is made or any political subdivision
or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise
considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority
thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing
_Jurisdiction”),_

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the
Paying Agent with respect to any Note or any Notes Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption

187


-----

price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the
“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments,
after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional
Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any
such Note in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts
will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner
or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate,
nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident
or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being
physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection
arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or
the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of
the Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder, after
reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction such be payable), to
provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or
identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy
any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty,
regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption
from all or part of such Tax but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to
provide such certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for
payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is required)
more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except
to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been
presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment of the principal
of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Tax;

(6) any Taxes that are required to be deducted or withheld on a payment to an individual pursuant to the
Directive or any law implementing, or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such
Directive;

(7) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a Holder or
beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the relevant Note to, or
otherwise accepting payment from, another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

(8) any Taxes required to be deducted or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code,
in each case, as of the Issue Date (or, in each case, any amended or successor version that is
substantively comparable), any regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof, or
any law implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto; or

(9) any combination of the items (1) through (8) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership
or any person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with
respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified
copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable

188


-----

evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available
to the Holders upon reasonable request, and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any
Note or any Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the
Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount
estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional
Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less
than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as
promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as
conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and indemnify the Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or
documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto)
or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or
penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery,
registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Notes, any Notes Guarantee, the
Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a
transfer of the Notes after this Offering).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any
successor to a Payor is organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or
any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes (or any Notes Guarantee)
is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or
therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading “Change of
Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to €100,000 or
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof; provided that Notes of €100,000 or less may only be redeemed in
whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of
purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase Notes as
described under this heading, “Change of Control,” in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally
exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes and given notice of redemption as described under “Optional
_Redemption” and that all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived._

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes and given notice of
redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have been
satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice
(the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require
the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101%
of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any,

189


-----

to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to
receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date
such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to
accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not
paid, and that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute
the Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must
follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the
extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer;

(2) deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect
of all Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee (or an authenticating agent)
the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been
tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar
for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Principal Paying Agent will promptly mail to each
Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the
Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be
transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal
in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new
Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require,
the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer in a daily newspaper with general
circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish Times) or to the extent and in the manner permitted by
such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie).

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions
that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover,
recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the
occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in
a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party
makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases
all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control,
conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing
for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

190


-----

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act
and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant.
To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture,
the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have
breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited
by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require
a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement. In addition, certain events that
may constitute a change of control under the Senior Facilities Agreement and require a mandatory prepayment of
Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future
Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute
a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the
exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or
require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial
effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase
may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds
will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes and Our Structure—We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control, and the_
_occurrence of certain important corporate events may not constitute a change of control.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other
Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no
precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a
disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require
the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority
in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if on the date of such Incurrence, after giving pro forma effect to
the Incurrence of such Indebtedness (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof) for the most
recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements for the Issuer are available
immediately preceding the date on which such Indebtedness is Incurred, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and
subject to the last proviso of the second paragraph of this covenant, non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries may
only Incur Indebtedness pursuant to this first paragraph if, at the time of such Incurrence and after giving effect
to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness and the application of the proceeds thereof, on a pro forma basis, the
aggregate amount of Indebtedness of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries Incurred pursuant to (i) this
paragraph and (ii) clauses (5) and (11) of paragraph two of this covenant would not exceed €60.0 million.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(“Permitted Debt”):

(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or
bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect
thereof and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate principal amount at
any time outstanding not exceeding (i) €335.0 million, plus (ii) in the case of any refinancing of any
Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees,
underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such
refinancing;

191


-----

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred
by another provision of this covenant; provided that, if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is
subordinated to or pari passu with the Notes or a Notes Guarantee, then the Guarantee shall be
subordinated to or pari passu with the Notes or such Notes Guarantee to the same extent as the
Indebtedness being guaranteed; or

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness arising by
reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the
terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however,
that:

(a) if the Issuer or a Guarantor is the obligor on any such Indebtedness and the obligee is not the
Issuer or a Guarantor, such Indebtedness is unsecured and if the aggregate principal amount of
such Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor exceeds €20.0 million ((i) except in respect of
intercompany current liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business in connection with
cash management operations of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries and (ii) only to the
extent legally permitted (the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all
procedures required in the reasonable judgment of directors or officers of the obligee or obligor to
protect such Persons from any penalty or civil or criminal liability in connection with the
subordination of such Indebtedness)), it is expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in
cash of all obligations with respect to the Notes, in the case of the Issuer, or the applicable Notes
Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) (x) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any
such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer and (y) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person
other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, shall be deemed, in each case, to
constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (3) by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4)

(a) Indebtedness represented by the Notes (other than any Additional Notes) and the related Notes
Guarantees (including any future Notes Guarantee);

(b) any Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (other than Indebtedness Incurred
under the Senior Facilities or Indebtedness described in clause (3) of this paragraph) outstanding
on the Issue Date;

(c) any Indebtedness of the Target and its Restricted Subsidiaries outstanding on the Completion Date
after giving effect to the Transactions (as described under “Use of Proceeds” in this Offering
Memorandum);

(d) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in clauses (4)(a),
4(b), 4(c), this clause 4(d), (5) and (13) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant;

(e) Management Advances; and

(f) any loan or other instrument contributing the proceeds of the Notes.

(5) subject to the final proviso to this paragraph, Indebtedness (i) of any Person outstanding on the date on
which such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or is
merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition
of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) Incurred to
provide all or a portion of the funds utilized to consummate the transaction or series of related
transactions pursuant to which a Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by
the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that, with respect to this clause (5), at the time of such
acquisition or other transaction and after giving pro forma effect to such acquisition or other
transaction and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness, (x) either (A) the Issuer would have been able

192


-----

to Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or (B) the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not be less than it
was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related
Incurrence of Indebtedness;

(6) Indebtedness under Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements and Commodity Hedging
Agreements not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a
member of Senior Management of the Issuer);

(7) Indebtedness consisting of (A) Capitalized Lease Obligations, mortgage financings, Purchase Money
Obligations or other financings, Incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase
price or cost of construction or improvement of property, plant or equipment used in a Similar Business
or (B) Indebtedness otherwise Incurred to finance the purchase, lease, rental or cost of design,
construction, installation or improvement of property (real or personal) or equipment that is used or
useful in a Similar Business, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any
Person owning such assets, and any Indebtedness which refinances, replaces or refunds such
Indebtedness, in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the
principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (7) and then outstanding,
will not exceed at any time outstanding the greater of 7.5% of Total Assets or €30.0 million; provided
that the Indebtedness exists on the date of such purchase, lease, rental or improvement or is created
within 270 days thereafter;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations, performance,
indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment, customs, value added tax (“VAT ”) or other tax
(including interest and penalties with respect thereto) or other guarantees or other similar bonds,
instruments or obligations and completion guarantees and warranties provided by the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary or relating to liabilities, obligations or guarantees Incurred in the ordinary course
of business or in respect of any governmental requirement, (b) letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances,
guarantees or other similar instruments or obligations issued or relating to liabilities or obligations
Incurred in the ordinary course of business or in respect of any governmental requirement, (provided,
_however, that upon the drawing of such letters of credit or other similar instruments, the obligations are_
reimbursed within 30 days following such drawing), (c) the financing of insurance premiums in the
ordinary course of business and (d) any customary cash management, cash pooling or netting or setting
off arrangements, including customary credit card facilities, in the ordinary course of business;

(9) Indebtedness arising from agreements providing for customary guarantees, indemnification, obligations
in respect of earnouts or other adjustments of purchase price or, in each case, similar obligations, in
each case, Incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition or disposition of any business or
assets or Person or any Capital Stock of a Subsidiary (other than Guarantees of Indebtedness Incurred
by any Person acquiring or disposing of such business or assets or such Subsidiary for the purpose of
financing such acquisition or disposition); provided that the maximum liability of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds,
including the fair market value of non-cash proceeds (measured at the time received and without giving
effect to any subsequent changes in value), actually received by the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in connection with such disposition;

(10)

(a) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or
similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business; provided,
_however, that such Indebtedness is extinguished within 30 Business Days of Incurrence;_

(b) customer deposits and advance payments received in the ordinary course of business from
customers for goods or services purchased in the ordinary course of business;

(c) Indebtedness owed on a short-term basis of no longer than 30 days to banks and other financial

193


-----

(11) subject to the final proviso to this paragraph, Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof and the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to
this clause (11) and then outstanding, will not exceed the greater of 6.2% of Total Assets or €25.0
million;

(12) Indebtedness Incurred (a) by a Receivables Subsidiary in a Qualified Receivables Financing and
(b) under Receivables Financing (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes any recourse receivables
financing or securitization arrangements) in an aggregate amount, in the case of this clause (b), not to
exceed €20.0 million; provided, in each case of clauses (b), that such Indebtedness is Incurred on
financing terms and with covenants, termination events and other provisions of such Receivables
Financing on market terms (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of
Senior Management of the Issuer);

(13) Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which,
when taken together with any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the principal amount of
all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (13) and then outstanding, will not exceed 100%
of the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Issuer from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted
Subsidiary) of its Subordinated Shareholder Funding or Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock,
Designated Preference Shares or an Excluded Contribution) or otherwise contributed to the equity
(other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares or an Excluded
Contribution) of the Issuer, in each case, subsequent to the Issue Date (excluding the Equity
Contributions); provided, however, that (i) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or
contributed shall be excluded for purposes of making Restricted Payments under the first paragraph
and clauses (1), (6) and (10) of the third paragraph of the covenant described below under “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments” to the extent the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries Incur_
Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed
shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (13) to the extent the
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries makes a Restricted Payment under the first paragraph and
clauses (1), (6) and (10) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments” in reliance thereon; and_

(14) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness consisting of local lines of
credit, overdraft facilities or local working capital facilities in an aggregate principal amount at any one
time outstanding, including all Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or
discharge any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (14), not to exceed the greater of 4.9% of
Total Assets or €20.0 million;

_provided, however, non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries may only Incur Indebtedness pursuant to clauses_
(5) and (11) of this paragraph if, at the time of such Incurrence and after giving effect to the Incurrence of such
Indebtedness and the application of the proceeds therefrom, on a pro forma basis, the aggregate amount of
Indebtedness of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries Incurred pursuant to (i) clauses (5) and (11) of this
paragraph and (ii) the first paragraph of this covenant would not exceed €60.0 million.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will
classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to
include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one (or more, if applicable) of the clauses of the
second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Completion Date under the Senior Facilities shall be deemed
initially Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph
or clause (4)(b) or (4)(c) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and may not be reclassified;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination
of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7),

194


-----

(11) or (13) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit,
bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other
Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal
to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS; and

(8) accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment
of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will
not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this
“—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be
(a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and
(b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this
“—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the euro equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall
be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred,
in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Euro
Equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such
Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such
refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be
deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not
exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of “Refinancing Indebtedness”; (b) the Euro Equivalent
of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness (i) outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on
the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date and (ii) of the Target and its Restricted
Subsidiaries outstanding on the Completion Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate
in effect on the Completion Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is
subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such
Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect
of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Layered Debt_**

The Issuer will not Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in
right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer unless such Indebtedness is also contractually
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes to the same extent and in the same manner as such Indebtedness is
subordinated to such other Indebtedness of the Issuer.

195


-----

The Issuer will not permit any Guarantor to, and no Guarantor will, Incur any additional Indebtedness that is
contractually subordinated in right of payment to any Indebtedness of such Guarantor unless such additional
Indebtedness is pari passu with the Notes Guarantee of such Guarantor or is also by its terms made to be
contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes Guarantee of such Guarantor.

No Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured, by virtue of being secured with
different collateral, by virtue of being secured on a first or junior Lien basis or by virtue of application of
waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on or in respect of the Issuer’s
or any Restricted Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including any payment in connection with any merger or
consolidation involving the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) except:

(a) dividends or distributions payable in Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock) or
in Subordinated Shareholder Funding; and

(b) dividends or distributions payable to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case of any
such Restricted Subsidiary making such dividend or distribution, to holders of its Capital Stock
other than the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary on no more than a pro rata basis);

(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the Issuer or any direct or
indirect Parent of the Issuer held by Persons other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than
in exchange for Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock));

(3) make any principal payment on, or purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire
for value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment, any
Subordinated Indebtedness (other than (a) any such payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption,
defeasance or other acquisition or retirement or in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation,
principal instalment or final maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of payment,
purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and (b) any
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness”);

(4) make any payment (whether of principal, interest or other amounts) on, or purchase, repurchase,
redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Subordinated Shareholder Funding (other
than any payment of interest thereon in the form of additional Subordinated Shareholder Funding); or

(5) make any Restricted Investment in any Person,

(each such dividend, distribution, payment, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other acquisition,
retirement or Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) through (5) is referred to herein as a “Restricted
_Payment”), if at the time the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted Payment:_

(a) a Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result immediately thereafter
therefrom);

(b) the Issuer is not able to Incur an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness” after giving effect, on a pro forma basis, to such Restricted Payment; or_

(c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments made
subsequent to the Issue Date (and not returned or rescinded) (including Permitted Payments
permitted below by clauses (5), (10), (11) and (17) of the second succeeding paragraph, but
excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the second succeeding paragraph) would
exceed the sum of (without duplication):

(i) 50% of Consolidated Net Income for the period (treated as one accounting period) from the
first day of the fiscal quarter commencing immediately prior to the Issue Date to the end of
the most recent fiscal quarter ending prior to the date of such Restricted Payment for which
internal consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are available (or, in the case such
Consolidated Net Income is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit);

196


-----

(ii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value (as determined in
accordance with the next succeeding paragraph) of property or assets or marketable
securities, received by the Issuer from the issue or sale of its Capital Stock (other than
Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) or Subordinated Shareholder Funding
subsequent to the Issue Date or otherwise contributed to the equity (other than through the
issuance of Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) of the Issuer subsequent to
the Issue Date (other than (v) the Equity Contribution, (w) Subordinated Shareholder
Funding or Capital Stock in each case sold to a Subsidiary of the Issuer, (x) Net Cash
Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities received from an issuance or sale of
such Capital Stock to a Restricted Subsidiary or an employee stock ownership plan or trust
established by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer for the benefit of its employees to the
extent funded by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, (y) Net Cash Proceeds or property
or assets or marketable securities to the extent that any Restricted Payment has been made
from such proceeds in reliance on clauses (1) or (6) of the second succeeding paragraph, and
(z) Excluded Contributions);

(iii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value (as determined in
accordance with the next succeeding paragraph) of property or assets or marketable
securities, received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the issuance or sale (other
than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or an employee stock ownership
plan or trust established by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer for the benefit of its
employees to the extent funded by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) by the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary subsequent to the Issue Date of any Indebtedness that has been
converted into or exchanged for Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock or

encumbrance or restriction.

into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and
outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is the
Successor Issuer or the Successor Guarantor (each as defined under “—Merger and Consolidation”),
any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be
deemed acquired or assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the
Successor Issuer or the Successor Guarantor;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to

amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this
paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to
such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any
material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in
the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or
other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of
Senior Management of the Issuer);

restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions on the distribution or transfer
of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets)

contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Holders of the Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Senior Facilities,
together with the security documents associated therewith, and the Intercreditor Agreement, in each
case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management of the Issuer) or

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Disposition
unless:

less than the fair market value of the Capital Stock, property or other assets subject to such Asset
Disposition (as determined by the Issuer’s Board of Directors); and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of such
Asset Disposition consists of:

Asset Disposition of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such Asset
Disposition);

(ii) Cash Equivalents;

202


-----

Subsidiary’s consolidated balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since the date of the

Indebtedness), as a result of which neither the Issuer nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
remains obligated in respect of such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that

other Restricted Subsidiary is released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness as a result of such
Asset Disposition;

(v) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (4) or (6) in the second paragraph of
this covenant;

(vi) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received from Persons

Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor;

(vii) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,
having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at any one time outstanding, not to exceed
the greater of 6.2% of Total Assets and €25.0 million (with the fair market value of each issue of
Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving
effect to subsequent changes in value); or

(viii) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (i) through (vii) of this paragraph (2).

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Cash Proceeds of the
Asset Disposition, within 365 days of the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset Disposition and
(ii) the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (i) any Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Refinancing Indebtedness in
respect thereof; provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment, purchase or
redemption of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (i), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will
retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in
an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid, purchase or redeemed; or (ii) any Pari
Passu Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary); provided
that the Issuer shall prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Pari Passu Indebtedness pursuant to this clause
(ii) only if the Issuer makes (at such time or in compliance with this covenant) an offer to Holders to
purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer
for an aggregate principal amount of Notes equal to the proportion that (x) the total aggregate principal
amount of Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum total aggregate principal amount of the Notes
outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount outstanding of such Pari Passu Indebtedness
(other than the Notes);

(2) purchase Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of the Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to at
least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the
date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date);

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(4) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business, if,
after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a
Similar Business;

(7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

203


-----

(8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Cash Proceeds pursuant to clause (1), (3), (4), (5) or
(6) of this paragraph or a combination thereof, provided that, a binding commitment shall be treated as
a permitted application of the Net Cash Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the earlier of
(x) the date on which such investment is consummated, and (y) the 180th day following the expiration
of the aforementioned 365 day period, if the investment has not been consummated by that date.

The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds not so used as set forth in this paragraph constitutes “Excess
Proceeds.” Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may temporarily reduce
revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by
the terms of the Indenture.

On the 366th day after an Asset Disposition (or the 546[th] day if a binding commitment, as described in
clause (8) above has been entered into), or at such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of
Excess Proceeds exceeds €20.0 million, the Issuer will be required within 10 Business Days thereof to make an
offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other
outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari
Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess
Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu
Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the
principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not
including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements
governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Notes.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to
other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any
Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders,
collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes
and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal
amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of
any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such
principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the
Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount
of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a
currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in
respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are
denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into
such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than
20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five
Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase
_Date”), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness_
required to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than
the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly
tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment,
on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn

tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn and in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The
Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted

-----

each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new
Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent), upon delivery of an
Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book
entry) such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note
surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of
€100,000. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book-entry) by the
Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act
and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture.
To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant,
the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have
breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into
or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related
transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of €7.5 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate;

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of €15.0 million, the
terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a resolution of the
majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer resolving that such
transaction complies with clause (1) above; and

(3) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate consideration in excess of €25.0 million,
the Issuer has received a written opinion from an Independent Financial Advisor that such Affiliate
Transaction is fair, from a financial standpoint, to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or that the
terms are not materially less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained in a
comparable transaction at such time on an arm’s-length basis from a Person that is not an Affiliate.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments” (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of the third paragraph of the covenant_
described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted Investment (other than
Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs (1)(b), (2), (11), (17) and (18) of the definition
thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering
into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation
arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted
Subsidiary or any Parent Entity, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation
rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation,
health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or
arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants
approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, in each case in the ordinary course of business;

(3) any Management Advances, and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or an entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries or
any Receivables Subsidiary;

employees);

(6) (i) the Transactions, (ii) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated by, and any
payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the
Issue Date, as these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended,
renewed, replaced or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant
or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect, and (iii) the entry into
and performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any arrangement pursuant to
which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is required or permitted to file a consolidated tax
return, or the formation and maintenance of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling
or management purposes in the ordinary course of business; provided, that payments under such Tax
Sharing Agreement shall not exceed, and shall not be duplicative of, the amounts described under
clause (7) of the definition of the term “Parent Expenses” and that the related tax liabilities of the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries are relieved thereby;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case
in the ordinary course of business, which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in
the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or an officer of the Issuer or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been
obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction between or among the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate (other than
an Unrestricted Subsidiary) of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity, including any joint venture,
that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary owns
an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares)
of the Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock, or Subordinated

in their reasonable determination and (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to
any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable;

(11) (a) payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or

acquisitions or divestitures, which payments (or agreements providing for such payments) in respect of
this clause (11) are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors in good faith;

(12) any transactions which the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary delivers a written opinion (in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor
stating that such transaction is (i) fair to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point
of view or (ii) on terms not less favorable that might have been obtained in a comparable transaction at
such time on an arm’s length basis from a Person who is not an Affiliate;

In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to
prospective investors, upon the request of such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule
144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Securities Act.

The Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Notes copies of all reports
furnished to the Trustee on the Issuer’s website and if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of

207


-----

the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof and to the extent that
the rules and regulations of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, copies of such reports furnished to the Trustee
will also be made available at the specified office of the listing agent in Ireland.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of
such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis
for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the
reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on
a basis that applied to such periods. Except as provided below, no report need include separate financial
statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any
other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the
reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or
business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Issuer’s (a) total revenue or Consolidated
EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been delivered to
the Trustee or (b) consolidated assets as of the last day of the most recent quarter for which annual or quarterly
financial reports have been delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the
Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this “Reports”
covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the
footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer. For
purposes of this covenant and any calculation to be made under the Indenture, the Issuer may use financial
statements of a predecessor of the Issuer or the Target for reporting or making calculations with respect to
periods commencing prior to the Completion Date.

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.

Subject to compliance with the final paragraph of this covenant, in the event that the Issuer or any Parent
becomes subject to the Admission and Disclosure Standards applicable to issuers of securities admitted to trading
on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (or the equivalent standards applicable to issuers of securities
admitted to trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or the Luxembourg Stock Exchange), for so long as it
elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other
reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the London Stock Exchange pursuant to such
Admission and Disclosure Standards (or the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or Luxembourg Stock Exchange
equivalent, as applicable) . Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, and provided that such requirements
require the Issuer to prepare and file annual reports, information, documents and other reports with the London
Stock Exchange, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, as applicable, the Issuer will
be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Subject to compliance with the final paragraph of this covenant, in the event that (i) the Issuer becomes
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with
such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the
Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith
judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the
provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and
procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports,
information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to
such Section 13(a) or 15(d). The Issuer may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial
statements under this covenant by providing any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent of the
Issuer so long as such reports (if an annual or quarterly report) include in footnote form, condensed consolidating
financial information together with the with separate columns for: (i) such Parent; (ii) the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) Guarantors on a combined basis; and (iv) any other Subsidiaries
of the Parent on a combined basis; (v) consolidating adjustments; and (vi) the total consolidated amounts. Upon
complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions
contained in the preceding paragraphs.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or
not the Issuer is the surviving corporation) or (2) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in either
case, in one or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:

(1) either: (a) the Issuer is the surviving Person; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer) (the “Successor Issuer”) or to which such sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition has been made is an entity organized or
existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union, Switzerland, Canada or any
province of Canada, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia, Norway or Switzerland;

(2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger with the Issuer (if other than the
Issuer) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition
has been made expressly assumes all the obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture (pursuant to a
supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee), the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents to which
the Issuer is a party;

(3) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction or transactions (and treating any
Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the surviving Person as a result of such transaction as
having been incurred by the surviving Person at the time of such transaction or transactions), no
Default or Event of Default exists;

(4) the Issuer or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the
Issuer), or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition has been
made would, on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related
financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period
(i) be permitted to incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described above under the caption
“—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (ii) have a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio not less than it was
immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, an
Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, in each case, stating that such consolidation, merger or
transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with this covenant and that all conditions
precedent in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been satisfied and that the Indenture
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Issuer or the Person formed by or surviving
any such consolidation or merger (as applicable) enforceable in accordance with its terms (provided
that any such opinion of counsel may assume matters of fact, including as a factual matter that one or
more conditions precedent have occurred).

In the event of any transaction described in and complying with the conditions listed in the immediately
preceding paragraph in which the Issuer is not the continuing Person, the successor Person formed or remaining
or to which such transfer is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power
of the Issuer, and the Issuer will be discharged from all obligations and covenants under the Indenture.

_The Guarantors_

The Guarantors (other than a Guarantor whose Notes Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the
terms of the Notes Guarantee and the Indenture as described under “—The Notes Guarantees”) will not, directly
or indirectly: (i) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not such Guarantor, is the
surviving corporation) or (ii) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of
the properties or assets of such Guarantor and its Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in
one or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:

(1) either (a) such Guarantor is the surviving Person; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation or merger (if other than such Guarantor) (the “Successor Guarantor”) or the Person to
which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition has been made expressly
assumes all the obligations of such Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee, the Indenture (pursuant to a
supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee), the

209


-----

Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents to which
it is a party;

(2) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction or transactions (and treating any
Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the surviving corporation as a result of such transaction
as having been incurred by the surviving corporation at the time of such transaction or transactions), no
Default or Event of Default exists; and

(3) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, in each case, stating
that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with this
covenant and that all conditions precedent in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been
satisfied and that the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and the Security Documents and the Notes Guarantee constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of
the Guarantor or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation and merger (as applicable)
enforceable in accordance with their terms (provided that any such opinion of counsel may assume
matters of fact, including as a factual matter that one or more conditions precedent have occurred).

In addition, neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will, directly or indirectly, lease all or substantially all of
the properties and assets of it and its Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or
more related transactions, to any other Person.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

This “Merger and Consolidation” covenant will not apply to (a) any consolidation or merger of any
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a Guarantor into the Issuer or a Guarantor, (b) any consolidation or
merger among Guarantors, (c) any consolidation or merger among Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are
not Guarantors and (d) any consolidation or merger among the Issuer and any Guarantor; provided in the case of
this clause (d) that, if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant
Guarantor is an entity organized or existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union, Canada,
any province of Canada, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia, Norway or Switzerland, and
such Guarantor shall expressly assume all of the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture
(pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee),
the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents to which the
Issuer is a party and, to the extent applicable, clauses (2) and (5) of the first paragraph of this covenant and
clauses (1) and (3) of the third paragraph of this covenant will be complied with. Clauses (3) and (4) of the first
paragraph of this covenant and clause (2) of the third paragraph of this covenant will not apply to any merger or
consolidation of the Issuer or any Guarantor with or into an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating the
Issuer or such Guarantor in another jurisdiction, to change its domicile or to change its legal form.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and
continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion
_Date”), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes:_

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”; and

(6) the provisions of clause (4) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Issuer,”_

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be
applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

210


-----

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first
day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with
regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action
taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The “Limitation on Restricted
_Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture but not during_
the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the
continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is
classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness.” In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the_
Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in the future
after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual
commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer
having an Investment Grade Status. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first
paragraph under this caption has been satisfied, provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for the
suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective. There can be no assurance that the Notes
will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently
omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the
Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens
shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral)
for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the relevant Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the
Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that (i) the Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii) the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
may undertake a Permitted Reorganization, (iii) the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance
with the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to cure any
ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency therein and (v) the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries may amend the Security Interests in any manner that does not adversely affect holders of the Notes
in any material respect; provided, however, that in the case of clause (ii), the Security Documents may not be
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced, unless
contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the
solvency of the relevant Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement,
(2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the Person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to
any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification
or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security
Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced are valid
Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such
Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement. In the event that the Issuer complies with the
requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and each relevant Security Agent shall (subject to customary
protection and indemnification) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

The Issuer will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding
under the Senior Facilities, any Credit Facility or any other Public Debt, respectively, in each case of the Issuer
or a Guarantor, unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which the Notes
Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the
form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Notes Guarantee
which Notes Guarantee will be subordinated to any Senior Indebtedness of such Restricted Subsidiary; provided,

211


-----

_however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for_
so long as the Incurrence of such Notes Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles. At the option of
the Issuer, any Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary
to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or
similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under
applicable law.

Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—The Notes
_Guarantees—Notes Guarantees Release.” A Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the_
option of the Issuer if at the date of such release either (i) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding
which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the
Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor or (ii) there is no Indebtedness of such
Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in
compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor
as at that date. At the request and expense of the Issuer, the Trustee and the relevant Security Agent shall each
take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these
provisions, subject to customary protection and indemnification.

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes
_and Our Structure—Each Guarantee and the security interests in the Collateral will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its_
_validity and enforceability.”_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Issuer
or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any (x) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or clause (1), (4), (5), (6), (7) (other than with respect to
Capitalized Lease Obligations), (11) or (13) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness” and (y) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in
the foregoing clause (x), the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agents shall
enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor
agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the
existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not
materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing substantially the same terms with respect to
release of Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests; provided that such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agents or, in the
opinion of the Trustee or Security Agents, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities
or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agents under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the
Trustee and the Security Agents shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor
Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement,
(2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any
Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new
Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor
Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes),
(5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any
Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in
accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely
affect the Holders in any material respect. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agents
to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under
“—Amendments and Waivers,” and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agents to enter into
any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or
Security Agents or, in the opinion of the Trustee or a relevant Security Agent, adversely affect their respective

212


-----

rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agents, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the
payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations
subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to
and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have
directed the Trustee and the Security Agents to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy
of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection
during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at our offices or at the offices of
the listing agent.

**_Limitation on Activities prior to the Completion Date_**

Prior to the Completion Date, the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
engage in any business activities or undertake any other activity, except that activity (i) reasonably relating to the
Acquisition, the Notes, the Indenture, the Senior Facilities, any related Hedging Obligations, the Escrow
Agreement, if any, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement; (ii) undertaken with the purpose of
fulfilling any other obligations relating to the Acquisition under the Notes, the Indenture, the Senior Facilities,
any related Hedging Obligations, the Escrow Agreement, if any, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor
Agreement; (iii) the establishment of the Issuer and any Subsidiary of the Issuer; and (iv) other activities not
specifically enumerated above that are de minimis in nature.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note issued under the Indenture when due and payable,
continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after notice by the
Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with its other
agreements contained in the Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such
Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon
the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
_provision”),_

and the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such
Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated,
aggregates €25.0 million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer, the Issuer or a Significant
Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated
financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Issuer, the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that,
taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted

213


-----

Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of
€25.0 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability
for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment
becomes final (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and
effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) with respect to Collateral
having a fair market value in excess of €5.0 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of
all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the
Security Documents or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or
unenforceable or the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security
interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days; and

(8) any Notes Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in
accordance with the terms of such Notes Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or
unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations
under its Notes Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days.

However, a default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default
until the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify
the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4) and (6) the Issuer does not cure such default within
the time specified in clauses (3), (4) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes under the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the
request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the
Notes under the Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued
and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the
Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) above has occurred and is continuing, the declaration
of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering
such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the
Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full,
within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (i) the annulment of the
acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and
(ii) all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became
due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if
any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without
any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and
may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by notice to the
Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with
respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such
acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment
or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs
and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the
Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee
customary indemnification and/or security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or
expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue
any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

214


-----

(2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to
pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to it against any loss,
liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the
offer of such indemnity and/or security; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day
period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee is aware, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the
degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may
refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking
any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to customary indemnification and/or security
satisfactory to the Trustee against all losses and expenses (including legal fees) caused by taking or not taking
such action. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will have no obligation to monitor
compliance by the Issuer with the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing
and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the
Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of
principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the
Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to
the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31,
2015), an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default
that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the
occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults,
their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default
for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured
without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods
prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or
certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any
such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not
within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances,
but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to
take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to
take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to
certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the
Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). However, without the consent of
Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (8), 75%) of the then outstanding principal amount of
the Notes affected, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

215


-----

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note
may be redeemed, in each case as described under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest or Additional Amounts, if
any, on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of
any such payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of
such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described
thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder
unless the Issuer agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release any security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral other than in
accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the non-payment of principal, premium or interest
or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the
Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of
the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the Indenture, except in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described
in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the relevant
Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary under any Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any
right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or that
does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material
respect under the Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member
of Senior Management of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Notes Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees,” to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the_
benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any
Notes Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in
respect thereof with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or
retaking or amendment is provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of this
“Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was
intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the
Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee or Security Agent

216


-----

pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or a relevant
Security Agent to any Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in
favor of the relevant Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Senior Facilities, in
any property which is required by the Security Documents or the Senior Facilities (as in effect on the
Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be
granted to the relevant Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the
Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not
prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied
with; or

(10) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on
such evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the
proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given
in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraph above, in order to effect an amendment
authorized by subsections (3) and (4) in respect of providing for a Notes Guarantee, it shall only be necessary for
the supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such additional Guarantor to be duly authorized and
executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii) such additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require,
the Issuer will publish notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver in Ireland in a daily newspaper with
general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish Times). Such notice of any amendment,
supplement and waiver may instead be published on the website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie).

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlled, or
controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to
be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and each Guarantor under the Notes and
the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of
an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the
Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders
under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate
(other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants described
under “—Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Issuer”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants_
described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross
acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default
provision, the guarantee provision (other than in respect of the Issuer) and the security default provision
described under “—Events of Default” (“covenant defeasance”).

217


-----

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the
Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the Issuer exercises
its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of
an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”), (4), (5) (with respect only to
Significant Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or (8) under “—Events of Default.”

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance
_trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose) cash_
in euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient, in the
opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, for
the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may
be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the relevant Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner
and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred
(and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based
on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax
law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is
qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940; and

(5) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the Trustee may
reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further
effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for
in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and
delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for payment
was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the
Principal Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Principal Paying Agent
for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity
within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Principal Paying Agent in the name, and
at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another
entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose), money or euro-denominated European
Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge
the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Principal Paying Agent for cancellation, for
principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and
payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be
paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the
Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the
redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and
an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and Discharge”
section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with,
_provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to_
compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

218

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes
Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each
Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the
U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide
that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set
forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise such of
the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person
would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any
action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any
such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer,
its Subsidiaries and Affiliates.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such
terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer
and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or
(b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the
Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for
removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by
the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, Taxes or
expenses (including legal fees) Incurred without gross negligence, wilful default or fraud on its part, arising out
of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

For so long as any of the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock
Exchange so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Notes will be published on the website of the Irish
Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie). In addition, for so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to
Holders of the Notes will be delivered by or on behalf of the Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream. Such notices
may instead be published in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the
_Irish Times) or if, in the opinion of the Issuer such publication is not practicable, in an English language_
newspaper having general circulation in Europe.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed,
such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with
respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given,
whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given in via Euroclear or Clearstream, it
is duly given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes
will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer and the

219


-----

Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for
payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors
under or in connection with the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, including damages. Any amount received or
recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a
court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any
Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only
constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount which the
recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that
receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is
practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any
Note (as applicable), the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such
recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the
Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this
currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note
or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information
used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent
obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent
cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a
waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment,
order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Notes Guarantee,
or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a noneuro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such noneuro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and to admit the
Notes to trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof. There can be no assurance that the application to list the
Notes on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and to admit the Notes on the Global Exchange Market
will be approved and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining such listing.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United States,
any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors, including judgments with
respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and
any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the
Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and
state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.
The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and each Guarantor, will appoint CT Corporation System, as their
agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture, the Notes and the
Notes Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New York state court located in the City of New York.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and
duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England.

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Rule 144A Global Note”). Notes sold to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S
under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Note” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Note, the
“Global Notes”). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the closing date, with a common depositary and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Note (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and
ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Note (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together
with the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants. Euroclear
and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’
securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories. Except under the
limited circumstances described below, the Notes will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain
states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those
securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge BookEntry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the
Notes registered in their name, will not have received physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will
not be considered the registered owners or “holders” of Notes under the Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as
applicable, will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture.
Accordingly, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect participants
must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and the participants through which they own BookEntry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of Notes under the Indenture.

Neither we nor the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Common Depositary, the nominee of the common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility, or be
liable, for any aspect of the records, or for payments made, relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one
or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in
respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants
has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of
consents or waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event
of default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of the Notes, reserve
the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered Notes in certificated form (the “Definitive
**Registered Notes”), and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their participants.**

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered
Notes:

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream following an event of default under the Indenture.

251


-----

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (2), their current procedure is to request that the Issuer issues or
causes to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests and not only to the
owner who made the initial request.

In such an event described in clauses (1) and (2), the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes,
registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of
Euroclear, Clearstream or the Issuer, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and
based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests),
and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that
legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes
have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are
surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee or an
authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the
Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting
replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the
Trustee and the Issuer to protect the Issuer, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture
from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer or Trustee
may charge for expenses in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to
become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture, the Issuer in their discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or
purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agents and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no
person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced
through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Registrar, and such registration is a means of
evidencing title to the Notes.

The Issuer will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the BookEntry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in
Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or
their respective nominees, as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global
Note from the amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price
payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by
Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion
thereof). The Issuer understands that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all
of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their participants’ accounts on
a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and
appropriate.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn
make said payments to or to the order of the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream.
Euroclear and/or Clearstream will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective
customary procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for,
or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature,
except as may be required by law and as described under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.” If any
such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the
Notes—Withholding Taxes” above, we will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order for the net

252


-----

amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or
withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of
such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. The Issuer
expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to
owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agents, the Registrar, the Transfer
Agents and the Paying Agent will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (for example, Euroclear or
Clearstream (or their respective nominee)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all
other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agents, the Registrar, the Transfer
Agents and the Paying Agents or any of its agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to,
or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing
the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or
payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

    - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Notes will be paid to holders of interests to such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with
Euroclear and Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of Notes
requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in
states which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes must
transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream
and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements
discussed under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule
144 under the U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the U.S. Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule
144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in
the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is
a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act or otherwise in accordance with the
transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities
laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the
transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that
such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer
Restrictions.”

253


-----

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in
the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly
will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry
Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by the
settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of us, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the transfer agent
and the Initial Purchasers is responsible for those operations or procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream
hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such
participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping,
administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and
Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial
institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other
organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers,
dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and
Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in
respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests
through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global
Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the ISE and admitted for trading on
the ISE’s Global Exchange Market. The Notes have been accepted for clearance through the facilities of
Euroclear and Clearstream. The international securities identification numbers and common code numbers for the
Notes are set out under “Listing and General Information—Clearing Information.” Transfers of interests in the
Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance
with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no
obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or
modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agents or the Paying Agent will
have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect
participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form.
Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on
the business day following the settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

254


-----

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in
same day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure
that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

255

**TAXATION**

**Certain German Tax Considerations**

The following is a general discussion of certain German tax consequences of the acquisition, holding and
disposal of the Notes. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all German tax considerations that
may be relevant to a decision to purchase Notes (for example, tax considerations concerning non-resident holders
presenting Notes for an over-the-counter payment (Tafelgeschäft) to a German Disbursing Agent (as defined
below)), and, in particular, does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular
purchaser. This summary is based on the tax laws of Germany currently in force and as applied on the date of this
Offering Memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences
of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, including the effect of any state, local or church taxes,
under the tax laws of Germany and any country of which they are resident or whose tax laws apply to them for
other reasons.

**_Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains_**

_Tax Residents_

This subsection “Tax Residents” refers to persons who are tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose
residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management and control is located in Germany).

Income derived from capital investments under the Notes as well as capital gains (which include currency
gains and losses, if any) from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes held by an
individual holder who is tax resident in Germany are in general subject to German income tax at a flat-tax rate of
25% (plus solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the Notes are held as
private investment (Privatvermögen). Individual holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a
maximum annual allowance (Sparer Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married couples filing jointly), whereby
actually incurred higher expenses directly attributable to a capital investment are not deductible.

The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany on income from
capital investments under the Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld (as described under section
“—Withholding Tax” below). To the extent withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case of Notes
kept in custody abroad or of no German Disbursing Agent (as defined below) being involved in the payment
process, the individual holder must include his or her income and capital gains derived from the Notes in his or
her annual tax return and will then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable,
church tax thereon). Further, an individual holder may apply for a taxation of all investment income of a given
year at his or her lower individual tax rate based upon an assessment to tax with any amounts over-withheld
being refunded. In each case, the deduction of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not
permitted. Losses incurred with respect to the Notes can only be offset with investment income of the individual
holder realized in the same or following assessment periods.

Pursuant to a tax decree issued by the German Federal Ministry of Finance dated October 9, 2012 a bad
debt-loss (Forderungsausfall) and a waiver of a receivable (Forderungsverzicht), to the extent the waiver does
not qualify as a hidden capital contribution, shall not be treated as a disposal. Accordingly, losses suffered upon
such bad debt-loss or waiver shall not be tax-deductible if the Notes are held as private investment
(Privatvermögen). The same rules should be applicable according to the said tax decree, if the Notes expire
worthless so that losses may not be tax-deductible at all. Losses suffered in a sale of Notes will only be
recognized according to the view of the tax authorities, if the proceeds received in the sale exceed the respective
transaction costs.

Where Notes form part of a trade or business of an individual or corporate holder or the income from the
Notes qualifies as income from the letting and leasing of property, the withholding tax, if any, will not satisfy the
personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual or corporate income tax
(plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax). Where Notes form part of a trade or business,
interest (accrued) must be taken into account as income. The respective holder will have to include income and
related (business) expenses in the annual tax return and the balance will be taxed at the holder’s applicable tax
rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the personal or corporate
income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability, will

256


-----

be refunded Where Notes form part of a German trade or business the current income and gains from the
disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes may also be subject to German trade tax. The trade
tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz). If the holder is an individual or
an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely or partly credited against the
personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method.

_Non-Tax Residents_

Interest, including accrued interest, and capital gains (which include currency gains and losses, if any) from
the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes received by holders who are not tax-resident in
Germany (i.e., holders whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat and place of effective management and
control is not located in Germany) are generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of
the business property of a permanent establishment, including a permanent representative, or a fixed base
maintained in Germany by the holder or (ii) the income otherwise constitutes German source income. In cases
(i) and (ii) a tax regime similar to that explained above under subsection “—Tax Residents” applies. Subject to
certain requirements a holder who is not tax-resident in Germany may benefit from tax reductions or tax
exemptions provided by an applicable tax treaty.

**_Withholding Tax_**

Ongoing payments received by an individual holder of the Notes who is a German tax resident will be
subject to German withholding tax if the Notes are kept or administered in a custodial account with or presented
for an over-the-counter payment to a German financial institution (i.e., a bank, a financial service institution, a
securities trading company or a securities trading bank, including a German branch of a foreign financial
institution but not a foreign branch of a German financial institution) or the Issuer (each, a “German Disbursing
**Agent,” auszahlende Stelle)).**

The withholding tax rate is 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding
being 26.375%) according to the flat tax regime (Abgeltungsteuer). If the individual holder is subject to church
tax, a church tax surcharge will also be withheld. For German Disbursing Agents an electronic information
system for church withholding tax purposes applies in relation to investment income received after December 31,
2014, with the effect that church tax will be collected by the German Disbursing Agent by way of withholding
unless the investor has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office
(Bundeszentralamt für Steuern) in which case the investor will be assessed to church tax.

The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly and factually related to the disposal
and the cost of acquisition taking into account currency gains and losses, if any) and interest accrued on the
Notes (“Accrued Interest,” Stückzinsen) derived by an individual holder who is a German resident irrespective
of any holding period provided the Notes have been held in a custodial account with the same German
Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition. If interest coupons or interest claims are disposed of
separately (i.e., without the Notes), the proceeds from the disposition are subject to withholding tax. The same
applies to proceeds from the redemption of interest coupons or interest claims if the Notes have been disposed of
separately.

To the extent the Notes have not been kept in a custodial account with the same German Disbursing Agent
since the time of their acquisition or if the Notes have been transferred into the custodial account of the German
Disbursing Agent only after their acquisition, upon the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment
withholding tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding
being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (plus Accrued Interest, if any),
unless the current German Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of
the Notes by the previous German Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a bank or financial services institution
within the European Union, European Economic Area or certain other countries in accordance with Art. 17 para.
2(i) of the EU Council Directive 2003/48/EC dated June 3, 2003 on the Taxation of Savings Income in the form
of interest payments (the “EU Savings Tax Directive”) (for example, Switzerland or Andorra). If the
withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes has been calculated on the basis
of 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), a German tax resident individual holder may
and in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds must also apply for an assessment on the
basis of his or her actual acquisition costs.

257


-----

In computing any German withholding tax, the German Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the
basis of the withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the Notes via the
German Disbursing Agent (for example, losses from the sale of other securities with the exception of shares).
The German Disbursing Agent may also deduct Accrued Interest on the Notes or other securities paid separately
upon the acquisition of the respective security via the German Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain
requirements and restrictions the German Disbursing Agent may credit foreign withholding taxes levied on
investment income in a given year regarding securities held by the individual holder in the custodial account with
the German Disbursing Agent. Foreign withholding taxes levied pursuant to the EU Savings Directive may only
be credited in the course of the assessment.

Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the German
Disbursing Agent, the German Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer Pauschbetrag)
of €801 (€1,602 for married couples filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be withheld
from the gross payment to be made by the German Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted if the
holder of the Notes has submitted to the German Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment
(Nichtveranlagungsbescheinigung) issued by the competent local tax office.

German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment of Notes held by a corporate holder who is a German tax resident (including via a commercial
partnership, as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal forms the status of
corporation has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax office) while ongoing payments, such as
interest payments, are subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of foreign tax and losses
incurred). The same may apply where the Notes form part of a trade or business (of an individual or of a
commercial partnership) subject to further requirements being met.

Interest and capital gains received by non-tax residents of Germany (i.e. persons whose residence, habitual
abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management and control is not located in Germany) are, in general, not
subject to German withholding tax and the solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital
gain is subject to German taxation (as outlined above under “—Non-Tax Residents”) and the Notes are held in a
custodial account with a German Disbursing Agent, withholding tax will be levied under certain circumstances.

Where Notes are not kept in a custodial account with a German Disbursing Agent and interest or proceeds
from the disposal, assignment or redemption of a Note or an interest coupon are paid over- the-counter by a
German Disbursing Agent to a non-resident, withholding tax will also apply. The withholding tax may be
refunded based on an assessment to tax or under an applicable tax treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).

**_Inheritance and Gift Tax_**

A gratuitous transfer of Notes by reason of death or as a gift will be subject to German inheritance or gift
tax if the decedent or donor or the heir, donee or other beneficiary (which in all cases can be, amongst others, an
individual or a corporation) is at the time of the transfer a resident or deemed to be a resident of Germany. If
neither the holder nor the recipient is a resident or deemed to be a resident of Germany at the time of the transfer,
no German inheritance or gift taxes will be levied unless the Notes are attributable to a German trade or business
for which a permanent establishment is maintained or a permanent representative has been appointed in
Germany. Exceptions from this rule apply to certain German citizens who previously maintained a residence in
Germany.

**_Other Taxes_**

No stamp, issue or registration taxes or such duties will be payable in Germany in connection with the
issuance, delivery or execution of the Notes. Currently, net assets tax is not levied in Germany. Holders of the
Notes should clarify themselves (or with their tax advisors) whether church tax is payable in addition as set out
above.

The European Commission and certain EU member states (including Germany) are currently intending to
introduce a financial transaction tax (“FTT”—see also below “The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax (FTT)”)
(presumably on secondary market transactions involving at least one financial intermediary). If the FTT is
introduced, transfers of Notes in which a financial intermediary established or deemed to be established in a
participating member state may be subject to FTT at a rate that will be determined separately by each
participating member state.

258


-----

**EU Savings Tax Directive**

Under the EU Savings Tax Directive, each EU member state must require paying agents (within the
meaning of such directive) established within its territory to provide to the competent authority of this state
details of payments of interest (or similar income) paid by a person within its jurisdiction to an individual
resident in another EU member state or to certain limited types of entities established in another EU member
state. The competent authority of the EU member state of the paying agent (within the meaning of the EU
Savings Tax Directive) is then required to communicate this information to the competent authority of the EU
member state of which the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident. However, for a transitional period,
Austria is instead required (unless during that period they elect otherwise) to withhold tax from such payments
currently at a rate of 35% (the ending of such transitional period being dependent upon the conclusion of certain
other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries).

A number of non-EU countries including Switzerland, and certain dependent or associated territories of
certain EU member states, have adopted similar measures (either provision of information or transitional
withholding) in relation to payments made by a person within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person
for, an individual resident or certain limited types of entity established in a EU member state (a withholding
system in the case of Switzerland at a rate of 35% with the option of the individual to have the paying agent and
Switzerland provide to the tax authorities of the EU member state the details of the interest payments in lieu of
the withholding). In addition, the EU member states have entered into provision of information or transitional
withholding arrangements with certain of those dependent or associated territories in relation to payments made
by a person in a EU member state to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident or certain limited
types of entity established in one of those territories of non-EU countries and territories.

By legislative regulations dated January 26, 2004, the German Federal Government enacted provisions
implementing the information exchange on the basis of the EU Savings Tax Directive into German law.

On March 24, 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive amending and
broadening the scope of the requirements described above. Member States are required to apply these new
requirements starting January 1, 2017. The changes will expand the range of payments covered by the Directive,
in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities. The Directive will also expand the
circumstances in which payments that indirectly benefit an individual resident in a Member State must be
reported. This approach will apply to payments made to, or secured for, persons, entities or legal arrangements
(including trusts) where certain conditions are satisfied, and may in some cases apply where the person, entity or
arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the European Union.

**The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax (FTT)**

The European Commission has published a proposal for a Directive for a common financial transactions tax
(FTT) in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia
(Participating Member States).

The proposed FTT has very broad scope and could, if introduced in its current form, apply to certain
dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.

Under current proposals the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of
the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one
party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State. A financial
institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a Participating Member State in a broad range of
circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or
(b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State.

The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States and it may be
altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear, however, it is expected that the FTT
will not apply prior to January 1, 2016. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate. Prospective
holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes by a U.S. holder (defined below), but does not purport to be a complete

259


-----

analysis of all potential tax effects. This summary is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and administrative interpretations
thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive
effect. No rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect
to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position
concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position
would not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a
holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, or to holders subject to special rules, such as financial
institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S.
holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, regulated investment
companies, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts, real estate investment trusts, S
corporations, partnerships or other pass through entities (or investors in such entities) and persons holding the
Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction, and persons who
own a direct or indirect equity interest in the Issuer. This discussion does not address U.S. Federal estate, gift or
alternative minimum tax considerations, the impact of the unearned income Medicare contribution tax, or nonU.S., state or local tax considerations. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes
for cash at original issue and at their “issue price” (as defined below) and who hold the Notes as capital assets
within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code. The discussion assumes that the Notes will be issued on the
issue date reflected on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation created
(or an entity that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) or organized in the United
States or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the
income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court
within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or
more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in
place to treat the trust as a U.S. person. If any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes
holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the
partner and the activities of the partnership. A holder that is a partnership, and partners in such partnerships,
should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of
the Notes.

**This summary is for informational purposes only. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their**
**tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances,**
**including the application of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the**
**application of U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws and state, local, foreign or other tax laws.**

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption” and “Description of the
Notes—Change of Control”) we may be obligated to make payments on the Notes in excess of stated principal
and interest. We intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies are remote and thus should not cause
the Notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. Assuming such position is respected, a U.S.
holder would be required to include in income the amount of any such additional payments at the time such
payments are received or accrued in accordance with such U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Our position is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder discloses in the proper
manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged this position, and the
Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders could be required to accrue interest
income at a rate higher than their yield to maturity, to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain
recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement or redemption of a Note, and to recognize foreign currency exchange
gain or loss with respect to such income. This disclosure assumes that the Notes will not be considered
contingent payment debt instruments. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential
application to the Notes of the contingent payment debt instrument rules and the consequences thereof.

260


-----

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Payments of stated interest on the Notes (including any Additional Amounts paid in respect of withholding
taxes and without reduction for any non-U.S. tax withheld) generally will be taxable to a U.S. holder as ordinary
income at the time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. holder’s method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

A U.S. holder of a Note that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and
that receives a payment of stated interest will be required to include in ordinary income the U.S. dollar value of
the euro interest payment (translated at the “spot rate” on the date such payment is received) regardless of
whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars. A cash method U.S. holder will not recognize exchange
gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but may have exchange gain or loss attributable to the
actual disposition of the euros so received.

A U.S. holder of a Note that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes
will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the amount of interest income in euros that has
accrued with respect to a Note during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such accrued income will be
determined by translating such income at the average rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to
an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within each taxable year.
A U.S. holder of a Note may elect, however, to translate such accrued interest income using the rate of exchange
on the last day of the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, using the
rate of exchange on the last day of the taxable year. If the last day of an accrual period is within five business
days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. holder may translate such interest at the “spot rate” on
the date of receipt. The above election will apply to other obligations held by the U.S. holder and may not be
changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder of a Note that uses the accrual method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income on
the date such interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if
any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received (translated at the “spot rate” on the date such
payment is received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of interest income that has
accrued during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted
to U.S. dollars. Such gain or loss will generally constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated as U.S. source
income or as an offset to U.S. source income, respectively.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The
Notes will be treated as issued with OID and subject to special U.S. federal income tax rules if the excess of such
Notes’ stated redemption price at maturity over their issue price is at least a de minimis amount (0.25% of such
Notes’ stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years to their maturity).
Generally, the “issue price” of the Notes will be the first price at which a substantial amount of such Notes are
first sold to persons other than bondhouses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of
underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers. The “stated redemption price at maturity” of the Notes is the
total of all payments provided by such Notes that are not payments of “qualified stated interest.” A “qualified
stated interest” payment is generally any one of a series of stated interest payments on the Notes that is
unconditionally payable at least annually at a single fixed rate or a qualified floating rate.

U.S. holders of Notes issued with OID must include OID in income (as ordinary income) calculated on a
constant-yield method before the receipt of cash attributable to the income, and will generally have to include in
income increasingly greater amounts of OID over the life of the Notes. The amount of OID includible in income
by a U.S. holder is the sum of the daily portions of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable
year or portion of the taxable year in which the U.S. holder holds the Note. The daily portion is determined by
allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period.
Accrual periods with respect to a Note may be of any length selected by the U.S. holder and may vary in length
over the term of the Note as long as (i) no accrual period is longer than one year and (ii) each scheduled payment
of interest or principal on the Note occurs on either the final or first day of an accrual period. The amount of OID
allocable to an accrual period equals the excess of (a) the product of the Note’s adjusted issue price at the
beginning of the accrual period and the Note’s yield to maturity (determined on the basis of compounding at the
close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period) over (b) the sum of the
payments of qualified stated interest on the Note allocable to the accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a
Note at the beginning of any accrual period is the issue price of the Note increased by (x) the amount of accrued

261


-----

OID for each prior accrual period and decreased by (y) the amount of any payments previously made on the Note
that were not qualified stated interest payments.

Any OID will be determined for any accrual period in euros and then translated into U.S. dollars in the same
manner as stated interest accrued by an accrual basis U.S. holder, as described above. In such event, upon receipt
of an amount attributable to OID (whether in connection with a payment of interest or the sale or disposition of
such Note), a U.S. holder of such Note will recognize foreign currency gain or loss that will be treated as
ordinary income or loss and be treated as U.S. source income or as an offset to U.S. source income, respectively.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Subject to the discussion of exchange gain or loss below, interest income and OID, if any, on a Note
generally will constitute foreign source income and generally will be considered “passive category income” or, in
the case of certain U.S. holders, “general category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S.
holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. holder at the rate
applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations. The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the
application of complex rules that depend on a U.S. holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. holders should consult
their tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits.

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Generally, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S.
holder will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the disposition
(less any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest not previously included in income, which will be
taxable as such) and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency
on such a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized
generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency translated at the “spot rate” on the date of
disposition. In the case of a Note that is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and,
if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized by
translating such amount at the “spot rate” on the settlement date of the disposition.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally equal the cost of such Note to such U.S. holder
increased by the amount of OID previously included in the U.S. holder’s income with respect to the Note, if any,
less any payments made with respect to the Note that are not qualified stated interest payments. If a U.S. holder
uses foreign currency to purchase a Note, the cost of the Note will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign
currency purchase price on the date of purchase. In the case of a Note that is traded on an established securities
market, a cash basis U.S. holder, and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder, will determine the U.S. dollar
value of the cost of such Note by translating the amount paid at the “spot rate” of exchange on the settlement date
of the purchase. The conversion of U.S. dollars to a foreign currency and the immediate use of that currency to
purchase a Note generally will not result in taxable gain or loss for a U.S. holder.

The special election available to accrual basis U.S. holders in regard to the purchase and sale of Notes
traded on an established securities market, which is discussed in the two preceding paragraphs, must be applied
consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

Subject to the discussion of exchange gain or loss below, gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be U.S. source gain or loss and
generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of the sale, exchange,
redemption, retirement or other disposition the Note has been held by such U.S. holder for more than one year.
Long-term capital gain realized by a non-corporate U.S. holder will generally be subject to taxation at a reduced
rate. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitation. Prospective purchasers should consult their tax
advisors as to the foreign tax credit implications of the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of
the Notes.

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may
recognize gain or loss that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal
amount of such Note. For these purposes, the principal amount of a Note is the U.S. holder’s purchase price of
the Note in euros. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates with respect to the principal amount
of such Note generally will equal the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the

262


-----

Note, determined on the date such payment is received for the Note or such Note is disposed of, and (ii) the U.S.
dollar value of the principal amount of the Note, determined on the date the U.S. holder acquired such Note. Such
gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be treated as U.S. source income or as
an offset to U.S. source income, respectively. In addition, exchange gain or loss may be realized with respect to
accrued interest and accrued OID, if any, as discussed under “—Payments of Stated Interest” and “—Original
Issue Discount.” However, upon a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note,
a U.S. holder will realize exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and accrued interest and accrued OID, if
any, only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized on the disposition.

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may issue Additional Notes as described under “Description of the Notes.” These Additional
Notes, even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as the original Notes, in some cases
may be treated as a separate series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, the Additional Notes may
be considered to have OID (or a greater amount of OID) which may affect the market value of the original Notes
if the Additional Notes are not otherwise distinguishable from the original Notes.

**_Exchange Gain or Loss with Respect to Foreign Currency_**

A U.S. holder will have a tax basis in any euros received as interest or upon the sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, equal to the U.S. dollar value thereof at the “spot rate” on the
date the interest is received or, in the case of a payment received in consideration of the sale or other disposition,
on the date used to compute exchange gain or loss with respect to such disposition (as discussed under “—Sale,
Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes”). Any gain or loss realized by a U.S.
holder on a sale or other disposition of the euros, including their exchange for U.S. dollars, will be ordinary
income or loss and generally will be income from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit
purposes.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirement_**

Treasury regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions
cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions. Under
the Treasury regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including, in certain
circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign
currency received in respect of a foreign currency note to the extent that any such sale, exchange, retirement or
other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. U.S. holders should consult their
tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including
any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, payments of interest and the proceeds from sales or other dispositions (including retirements or
redemptions) of Notes held by a U.S. holder may be required to be reported to the IRS unless the U.S. holder is
an exempt recipient and, when required, demonstrates this fact. In addition, a U.S. holder that is not an exempt
recipient may be subject to backup withholding (at a 28% rate) unless it provides a taxpayer identification
number and otherwise complies with applicable certification requirements.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited
against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the
appropriate information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Certain U.S. holders may be required to report information relating to an interest in our Notes, subject to
certain exceptions (including an exception for Notes held in accounts maintained by certain financial
institutions). U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding any reporting requirements relating to their
ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”), a
“foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold U.S. tax on certain pass through payments made after

263


-----

December 31, 2016 to the extent such payments are treated as attributable to certain U.S. source payments.
Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final regulations
defining foreign pass-through payments are filed generally would be “grandfathered” unless materially modified
after such date. To date, no such regulations have been issued. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign
financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on the Additional Notes only if there is a significant
modification of the Additional Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this
grandfathering period. However, if Additional Notes are issued after the expiration of the grandfathering period,
such Additional Notes have the same ISIN or Common Code as the Original Notes and Additional Notes, and
such Additional Notes are subject to withholding under FATCA, then withholding agents may treat all Notes,
including the Additional Notes, as subject to withholding under FATCA. Non-U.S. governments have entered
into agreements with the United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such
agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Holders should consult their
own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Additional Notes. In the event any
withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Additional Notes, there generally will
be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

**_Certain General Tax Considerations—Payments by a Guarantor_**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of the Notes (or other amounts due under the Notes) it is
possible that such payments may be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates, subject to such relief as may
be available under the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty, or to any other exemption which may
apply.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

We intend to offer the Notes through the Initial Purchasers. Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited,
Barclays Bank PLC, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and RBC Europe Ltd. are the Initial Purchasers.

Subject to the terms and conditions contained in the purchase agreement between the Issuer, the Guarantors
and the Initial Purchasers dated the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have agreed to sell to the Initial
Purchasers and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from us, severally and not jointly, Notes in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the entire principal amount of the Notes. The obligations of the Initial
Purchasers under the purchase agreement, including their agreement to purchase the Notes from the Issuer, are
several and not joint. The purchase agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers are obligated, severally and not
jointly, to purchase all of the Notes, if any are purchased. In the event that an Initial Purchaser fails or refuses to
purchase the Notes which it has agreed to purchase, the purchase agreement provides that the purchase
commitments of the other Initial Purchasers may be increased or that the purchase agreement may be terminated.

The Initial Purchasers are offering the Notes, subject to prior sale, when, as and if issued to and accepted by
them, subject to approval of legal matters by their counsel, including the validity of the Notes, and other
important conditions contained in the purchase agreement, including the receipt by the Initial Purchasers of
evidence that the Senior Facilities have been, or will be applied, in the manner described in the “Use of
Proceeds.” The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject
orders in whole or in part.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they propose to offer the Notes initially at the offering price
listed on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum and may also offer the Notes to selling group members at
the offering price less a selling concession. After the initial offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the
offering price and any other selling terms of the Notes at any time without notice.

The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates.

We have agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with this
Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. We also have agreed to indemnify and hold
harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, or to
contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

**United States**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act and may not be offered
or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons unless the Notes and the Guarantees are registered under the U.S.
Securities Act, or an exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act is available.
Accordingly, each of the Initial Purchasers, severally and not jointly, has agreed that it will not offer or sell the
Notes and the Guarantees except (i) to “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A) (“QIBs”) in
reliance on Rule 144A and (ii) to persons other than “U.S. persons” (as defined in Regulation S) outside the
United States in offshore transactions (as defined in Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S.

In addition, until the expiration of 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering and the
closing date, an offer or sale of Notes and the Guarantees within the United States by a broker/dealer (whether or
not participating in this Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such
offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act or pursuant to
another exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act. For a description of certain further restrictions
on resale or transfer of the Notes see “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions.”

**United Kingdom**

In the purchase agreement, each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, has also represented and
warranted to us that:

(1) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000 with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the
United Kingdom; and

(2) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and it will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or instrument to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of

265


-----

Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) received by it in connection with the issue
or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 does not apply.

**General**

**_No Sale of Similar Securities_**

The Issuer has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that it or its affiliates and subsidiaries will not,
directly or indirectly, sell or offer to sell any of the Notes or any instrument relating to debt or preferred equity
securities for a period of 45 days from the date the Notes are issued without first obtaining the written consent of
Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited.

**_New Issue of Notes_**

The Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We have applied to have the
Notes listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and for admission to trading on the Global Exchange
Market of the ISE, though we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing
will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they presently intend to make a market in the
Notes after completion of this Offering. However, the Initial Purchasers are under no obligation to do so and may
discontinue any market making activities at any time without notice. In addition, any such market making
activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly,
we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, or that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that
you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you.

**_Stamp Tax_**

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes
and other charges in connection with purchases of securities.

**_Price Stabilization and Short Positions_**

In connection with the Offering, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited (the “Stabilizing Manager”) (or
persons acting on its behalf) may purchase and sell Notes in the open market. These transactions may include
over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids. Over-allotment
involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing
transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or
maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open
market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial
Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the Notes originally sold by such broker/
dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These transactions may be
effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result, the
price of the Notes may be higher than the prices that otherwise might exist in the open market. Neither we nor the
Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the
transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In addition, there is no obligation on the
Stabilizing Manager to engage in such transactions and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any
representation that the Stabilizing Manager will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once
commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. Any stabilizing action, if commenced, must end no later
than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes.

**_Initial Settlement_**

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefore on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the business day following the date of
pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 under the U.S.
Exchange Act trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days, unless the
parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the
date of pricing or the next succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at
the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on
the date of pricing or the next succeeding business day should consult their own advisor.

266


-----

**_Other Relationships_**

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full-service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. From time to time,
certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide,
investment banking, commercial banking, financial advisory and other services to us, our affiliates and our
shareholders, in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees and
commissions. The Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. In addition, the
Initial Purchasers, or their respective affiliates, are lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility and New Term
Loan B Facility and a €200.0 million senior unsecured bridge facility that we have entered into as borrowers to
provide financing for the Acquisition in the event the Offering is not consummated, and such entities may act as
counterparties in the hedging arrangements we expect to enter into in connection with the Transactions, and will
receive customary fees for their services in such capacities. Furthermore, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch
acted as sell-side advisor to Triton in connection with the Acquisition. Finally, Credit Suisse AG, London
Branch, will act as the agent and shared security agent under the Senior Facilities, and receive customary fees
and indemnities in connection therewith.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold
a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and
financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such
investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates. If the Initial
Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to us
consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates
would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions that consist of either the purchase of credit default
swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any
such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent
research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that
they acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments.

it being understood that we use the terms “offshore transactions” and “United States” with the meanings
given to them in Regulation S.

(2) You acknowledge that this Offering Memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from registration
under the U.S. Securities Act and may not comply in important respects with SEC rules that would apply to
an offering document relating to a public offering of securities.

(3) You represent that you are not an affiliate (as defined in Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act) of the
Issuer, that you are not acting on our behalf and that either:

(4) You acknowledge that none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or any person representing the Issuer or the
Initial Purchasers has made any representation to you with respect to the Issuer or the offering of the Notes,
other than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum. Accordingly, you acknowledge that no
representation or warranty is made by the Initial Purchasers or any person representing the Initial Purchasers
as to the accuracy or completeness of such materials. You represent that this Offering Memorandum has
been delivered to you and that you are relying only on this Offering Memorandum in making your
investment decision with respect to the Notes. You agree that you have had access to such financial and

laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of your property or the property of that investor
account or accounts be at all times within your or their control and subject to your or their ability to resell
the Notes pursuant to Rule 144A or any other available exemption from registration under the U.S.
Securities Act.

(6) In the case of Rule 144A Notes, you agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for
which you are purchasing Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance of the Notes

sold or otherwise transferred only:

(a) to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any subsidiary thereof;

exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or in any transaction no subject
thereto;

(c) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale under Rule 144A, to a person the seller reasonably
believes is a qualified institutional buyer that is purchasing for its own account or for the account of
another qualified institutional buyer and to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in
reliance on Rule 144A;

(d) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under
the U.S. Securities Act; or

(e) under any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act,

subject in each of the above cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of the seller’s property or
the property of an investor account or accounts be at all times within the seller or account’s control and to
compliance with any applicable state securities laws and any applicable local laws and regulations.

You also acknowledge that to the extent that you hold the Notes through an interest in a global note, the
Resale Restriction Period (as defined below) may continue until one year after the issuer, or any affiliate of the
issuer, was the owner of such note or an interest in such global note, and so may continue indefinitely.

(7) You also acknowledge that:

(a) the above restrictions on resale will apply from the Issue Date until the date that is one year after the
later of the Issue Date, the closing date of the issuance of any additional Notes and the last date that we
or any of our affiliates was the owner of the Notes or any predecessor of the Notes (“Resale
**Restriction Period”), and will not apply after the applicable Resale Restriction Period ends;**

(b) if a holder of Notes proposes to resell or transfer Notes under clause (6)(d) and (6)(e) before the
applicable Resale Restriction Period ends, the seller must deliver to the Issuer and the Trustee a letter
from the purchaser in the form set forth in the Indenture which must provide, among other things, that
the purchaser is an institutional accredited investor that is acquiring the Notes not for distribution in
violation of the U.S. Securities Act;

(c) the Issuer and the Trustee reserve the right to require in connection with any offer, sale or other transfer
of Notes under (i) clauses (6)(d) and (e) above the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certifications and/
or other information satisfactory to the Issuer and the Trustee, and under (ii) EACH OF THE CASES in
clauses 6(a) through (d) to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of

UNITED STATES WITHIN THE MEANING OF REGULATION S UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OR
(E) PURSUANT TO ANY OTHER AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, AND (3) AGREES THAT IT WILL GIVE TO EACH
PERSON TO WHOM THIS NOTE IS TRANSFERRED A NOTICE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE EFFECT OF

If you purchase Notes, you will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply to
holders of beneficial interests in these Notes as well as to holders of these Notes.

(8) You agree that you will give to each person to whom you transfer the Notes notice of any restrictions on the
transfer of such Notes.

(9) You acknowledge until 40 days following the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of the Notes

registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance
with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act.

(10) You acknowledge that the Trustee will not be required to accept for registration or transfer any Notes
acquired by you except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Issuer and the Trustee that the
restrictions set forth therein have been complied with.

(11) You acknowledge that we, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the
above acknowledgments, representations and agreements. You agree that if any of the acknowledgments,
representations or agreements you are deemed to have made by your purchase of Notes are no longer
accurate, you will promptly notify the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers. If you are purchasing any Notes as a
fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, you represent that you have sole investment discretion
with respect to each of those accounts and that you have full power to make the above acknowledgments,
representations and agreements on behalf of each account.

(12) You understand that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by the Issuer,
the Guarantors or any of the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Notes or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or
the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the
Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth in the front of this Offering Memorandum under
“Notice to New Hampshire Residents,” “Notice to Prospective Investors,” “Notice to Certain European
Investors” and under “Plan of Distribution.”

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is a company established under the laws of Germany and the Guarantors are companies
established under the laws of Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom.

None of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ directors, officers and other executives are residents or citizens of
the United States. Furthermore, none of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ assets are located within the United
States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon
such persons, the Issuer or the Guarantors or to enforce against them, the Issuer or the Guarantors judgments of
U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws despite the fact
that, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Guarantors have appointed, or will appoint, an
agent for the service of process in New York.

**The European Union**

**Austria**

According to the Austrian Enforcement Act (Exekutionsordnung), foreign judgments are only enforceable if
reciprocity is warranted by a bilateral or multilateral treaty between the countries involved or by an ordinance
(Verordnung) of the Austrian government (in which ordinance the Austrian government confirms the
reciprocity). As reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, within the
meaning of section 79 of the Austrian of the Austrian Enforcement Act between Austria and the U.S is currently
not ensured by bilateral treaties or otherwise, judgments of a United States court are not recognized and
enforceable in Austria. Therefore, a judgment rendered by any court in the United States (whether a Federal court
or a State court) against an Austrian Guarantor or against an Austrian collateral provider whether or not
predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws will not be enforceable in Austria. Accordingly, the subject matter
upon which a judgment has been obtained in a United States federal or state court must be re-litigated before
Austrian courts in accordance with applicable Austrian Civil Procedure Laws (Zivilprozessverfahren). Only after
having obtained a final judgment before Austrian courts, enforcement procedures can be initiated under the
Austrian Enforcement Act.

**England and Wales**

There is currently no treaty between the United States and England providing for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (although the U.S. and the United Kingdom are
both parties to the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards).
Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on
civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be
recognized or enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales,
proceedings must first be initiated in England by way of a civil law action on the judgment debt before a court of
competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. To enforce the judgment debt, the English court would not
generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is described
below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no
good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is
conditional upon (among other things) the following:

    - the U.S. court had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws
principles or rules of English private international law;

    - the U.S. judgment was final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in
the court which pronounces it and being for a debt for a definitive sum of money;

    - the U.S. judgment was not for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature or in
respect of a penalty or fine or otherwise based on a non-English law that an English court considers to
relate to penal, revenue or other public law;

    - the U.S. judgment does not contravene public policy or statute in England and Wales;

    - the U.S. judgment has not been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum
assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and is not otherwise in breach of the
Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

    - the U.S. judgment has not been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural or
substantial justice;

272


-----

    - the U.S. judgment is not a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English court or another
court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England or conflicts with an earlier judgment of such
court;

    - the English enforcement proceedings were commenced within the relevant limitation period; and

    - the U.S. judgment was not obtained contrary to an agreement for the settlement of disputes under
which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in a United States court
(to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit).

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England judgments in civil and commercial
matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Notwithstanding this, we cannot assure you that
those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England.

In addition, we cannot assure you whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil
liability if the original action was commenced in England, instead of the United States and predicated solely upon
U.S. federal securities laws.

If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will be
enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. These methods generally permit the court discretion
to prescribe the manner of enforcement. It may not be possible to obtain an English judgment or to enforce that
judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor
has any set off or counterclaim against the judgment creditor.

**Germany**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Germany. Our directors and executive
officers live outside the United States. The assets of our directors and executive officers and almost all our assets
are located outside the United States. As a result, although we have appointed an agent for service of process
under the Indenture, it may be difficult for you to serve process on those persons or us in the United States or to
enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them or us based on civil liability provisions of the securities
laws of the United States.

We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil
liabilities based on the state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to
enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts. The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty
providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and
commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment given by any court in the United States, whether or not
predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. Under current
practice, a final and conclusive judgment by a U.S. court, however, may be recognized and thereby given binding
effect in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set
forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally
will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The
recognition and enforcement of the U.S. judgment by a German court is conditional upon a number of factors,
including the following requirements which are set out in Section 328 of the German Code of Civil Procedure:

    - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction of the case in accordance with German law principles of
jurisdictional competence;

    - the document introducing the proceedings was duly served and made known to the defendant in a
timely manner that allowed for adequate defense;

    - the judgment is not contrary to (i) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a German
court or (ii) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which is to be
recognized in Germany and the procedure leading to the respective judgment under (i) or (ii) is not in
contradiction to any such prior judgment or a proceeding previously commenced in Germany;

    - the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with material principles of German law, including,
without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of Germany (Grundrechte). In this
context, it should be noted that any component of a U.S. federal or state court civil judgment awarding
punitive damages or any other damages which do not serve a compensatory purpose, such as treble
damages, will not be enforced in Germany. They are regarded to be in conflict with material principles
of German law;

273


-----

    - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed; and

    - the judgment became res judicata in accordance with the law of the place where it was pronounced.

Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after
having received an exequatur decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above principles.

Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial
matters obtained from U.S. courts in Germany. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce
judgments in Germany will be successful.

German courts usually deny the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages (which do not serve a
compensatory purpose) as they are regarded to be in conflict with fundamental principles of German law.
Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages
only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Enforcement is also subject to
the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium, general principles
of good faith (Treu und Glauben), clawback (Anfechtung) as well as other similar laws affecting creditor’s rights
generally. In addition, it is doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability
in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In as far as
the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common
law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior to trial compel the
production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this
manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No equivalent pre-trial discovery process exists under
German law.

If the party in whose favor a final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in
Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under
such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States against such party or such persons
will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment
relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the
judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.

**Italy**

Wittur Italia Holding S.r.l. is a guarantor entity incorporated as a società a responsabilità limitata under the
laws of the Republic of Italy and Wittur S.p.A. is a guarantor entity incorporated as a società per azioni under the
laws of the Republic of Italy (collectively, the “Italian Entities” or the “Italian Guarantors”). The directors,
officers and other executives of the Italian Entities are neither residents nor citizens of the United States (the
“Italian Persons”). Furthermore, most of the assets of the Italian Entities or the Italian Persons are located
outside the United States.

As a result, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Italian Guarantors or any such other
person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes
or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may
not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, although the Italian Guarantors will appoint an agent for
service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in
connection with any action in relation to the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture or under U.S.
securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on the Italian Guarantors or on
such other persons as mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon
the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws. If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the
Italian Guarantors, or any of its respective directors or executive officers, investors will need to enforce such
judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company or individual has assets. Even though the enforceability of
U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for the Republic of Italy you should consult
with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or
elsewhere outside the United States.

We have been advised by counsel in the Republic of Italy that the recognition and enforcement of a
judgment rendered by a U.S. federal or New York state court in the Republic of Italy is governed by Article 64 of

274


-----

the Private International Law Act (i.e., Law 218 of May 31, 1995) (the “PIL Act”) (and certain other provisions
of the PIL Act). Pursuant to the PIL Act, any judgment issued by a U.S. federal or New York state court should
automatically be recognized in the Republic of Italy provided that the following requirements are met:

    - the relevant U.S. federal or New York state court that passed the judgment had jurisdiction under the
principles on jurisdiction of Italian law;

    - the defendant had received the summons in accordance with the laws of the state where the
proceedings have taken place, and the defendant had not been deprived of his fundamental rights of
defense;

    - the parties had appeared in the proceedings in accordance with the local procedural law, or the default
proceedings (in contumacia) were declared in accordance with that law;

    - the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court must be final and binding (passato
_in giudicato) according to the law of the state in which it was rendered;_

    - the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is not in conflict with any earlier
final and binding judgment issued by an Italian court;

    - there is no pending proceeding before any Italian court in relation to the same subject matter and
between the same parties which started prior to the commencement of the proceedings before the
relevant U.S. federal or New York state court; and

    - the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is not contrary to Italian public
policy.

In addition, according to Article 67 of the PIL Act, if a judgment rendered by a U.S. federal or New York
state court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or it is necessary to enforce such judgment, a
proceeding must be instituted in the competent Court of Appeal in the Republic of Italy to that end. The
competent Court of Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but reviews exclusively the existence of all
the requirements set out above (including requiring that the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York
state court is not contrary to public policy in Italy).

**Spain**

Claims may become time-barred (15 years being the general term established for obligations in personam
under article 1,964 of the Spanish Civil Code (Código Civil)) or may be or become subject to the defense of
set-off or counterclaim.

The terms “enforceable”, “enforceability”, “valid”, “legal”, “binding” and “effective” (or any combination
thereof) mean that all the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type
that may be enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced
in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. In particular, enforcement before the courts will in any event
be subject to:

    - the nature of the remedies available in the courts; and

    - the availability of defenses such as (without limitation), set-off (unless validly waived), fraud (fraude
_de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure,_
unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, abatement and counter-claim.

In general terms, under Spanish law, any guarantee must guarantee another obligation to which it is
ancillary, which must be clearly identified in the relevant guarantee agreement. Therefore, the guarantee, due to
its incidental nature (principio de accesoriedad) follows the underlying obligation in such a way that nullity or
termination of the underlying obligation entails nullity of the guarantee and termination of the underlying
obligation entails termination of the guarantee. In the event that the guarantors are able to prove that there are no
existing and valid guaranteed principal obligations (obligación principal garantizada), Spanish courts may
consider that the guarantors’ obligations under the relevant guarantees are not enforceable.

Under Spanish law, there are some provisions on equity capitalization which have been taken into account
when guarantees are enforced. For example, when payments under a guarantee cause the net equity (patrimonio
_neto) of Wittur Elevator Components, S.A.U. (the “Spanish Guarantor”) to fall below half of its share capital,_
the Spanish Guarantor will be obliged to be wound up (disolución), unless its share capital is increased or
decreased in the required amount to re-establish the balance between its net equity and its share capital (capital
_social), and provided it is not required to file for insolvency._

-----

Under Spanish law, guarantees of the type issued by the Spanish Guarantor to guarantee the Notes (the
“Spanish Guarantee”) may only be granted by those entities that are incorporated as stock companies under the
laws of Spain (sociedades anónimas or “S.A.”). This is due to the fact that any subsidiary incorporated as limited
liability companies under the laws of Spain (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada or “S.L.”) is subject to the
prohibition contained in article 402 of the Spanish Royal Decree Law 1/2010, of 2 July, on Spanish companies
(Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2010, de 2 de julio, por el que se aprueba el Texto Refundido de la Ley de
_Sociedades de Capital (the “Spanish Companies Act”)), which states that a limited liability company cannot_
execute or secure a bond issuance or other issuance of securities.

The Spanish Companies Act prohibits financial assistance to stock companies (sociedades anónimas or S.A.)
in relation to the acquisition of their own shares or the shares of their direct or indirect holding company.

Therefore, the obligations under the Spanish Guarantee granted by a Spanish Guarantor:

    - shall not extend to any use of the proceeds of the Notes for the purpose of acquiring shares representing
the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of its direct or
indirect holding company, as it is the case of the Acquisition, or refinancing a previous debt incurred
for the acquisition of shares representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares
representing the share capital of its direct or indirect holding company, as it is the case of part of the
Existing Senior Facilities Agreement; and

    - shall be deemed not to be undertaken or incurred by the Spanish Guarantor to the extent that the same
would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of article 150 of Spanish Companies
Act, and, in that case, all provisions of such Spanish Guarantee shall be construed accordingly in the
sense that, in no case can any Spanish Guarantee given by the Spanish Guarantor secure repayment of
the above mentioned funds.

Therefore, the obligations and liabilities assumed by the Spanish Guarantor under the Spanish Guarantee
shall be deemed to have been given only in relation to the use of proceeds of the Notes which are not used neither
for (i) the funding of the Acquisition, (ii) the refinancing of the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, to the
extent that such funds were used for a previous acquisition of shares of the Spanish Guarantor or its direct or
indirect holding company, nor (iii) the payment of the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the above
transactions.

For the purposes of first paragraph above, a reference to a “holding company” of the Spanish Guarantor
shall mean the company (if any) which, directly or indirectly, owns the majority of the voting rights of such
Spanish Guarantor or that may have a dominant influence on such Spanish Guarantor. It shall be presumed that
one company has a dominant influence on another company when:

    - any of the scenarios set out in section 1 of article 42 of the Spanish Commercial Code (Código de
_Comercio) are met; or_

    - when at least half plus one of the members of the managing body of the Spanish Guarantor are also
members of the managing body or top managers (altos directivos) of the dominant company or of
another company controlled by such dominant company.

The holders of the Notes from time to time will not be the secured parties under the security interest,
governed by Spanish law, which will be granted to secure the obligations and liabilities under the Senior
Facilities Agreement. Under Spanish law, a security interest created as security for the benefit of third parties
who are not direct parties to the relevant agreement creating the security interest are unenforceable by such
parties. Notwithstanding, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a parallel debt structure (as an
abstract obligation independent from the obligation under the Notes) whereby, subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, all the Debtors (as defined therein), including the Issuer, undertake to pay to the
Security Agent any amount payable by them under the Notes. This allows the Security Agent to be the
beneficiary of such security interest governed by Spanish law. Upon enforcement of the security interest
governed by Spanish law, the price obtained from the auction shall be delivered by the notary public directly to
the Security Agent for its distribution amongst the creditors in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement. The use of parallel debt in Spanish deals is a new concept, and there has not been any court
precedent to ensure its validity and enforceability. Also, the registration of the security interests governed by
Spanish law may be rejected if the relevant registrar considers that this structure is not valid or enforceable.

**Sweden**

We have been advised by Swedish counsel that enforceability of a judgment rendered by a foreign court in
civil and commercial matters, is generally considered conditional upon that enforceability of such judgment is
expressly provided for under Swedish law or upon a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments. The United States and Sweden do not have a convention or treaty providing for the
reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (although the United States
and Sweden are both parties to the New York Convention on Arbitral Awards). This means that a judgment
rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability would not be directly
enforceable in Sweden.

In order to enforce any such judgment in Sweden, proceedings must therefore be initiated by way of civil
law action on the judgment debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in Sweden, or an administrative tribunal
or executive or other public authority of the Kingdom of Sweden. In such an action, a judgment rendered by any
federal or state court in the United States may be regarded as evidence in respect of, for example, factual
circumstances or the content of U.S. law.

**Turkey**

Pursuant to Articles 50-59 of the International Private and Procedure Law (Law no.5718), in order to
enforce a foreign court judgement, an enforcement proceeding must be initiated before a competent Turkish
court. To be recognized and enforced in these enforcement proceedings, the foreign judgment must meet all of
the following requirements:

    - there must be a relevant de jure or de facto reciprocity of recognition of judgments between the courts
of Turkey on the one hand, and the foreign jurisdiction where the judgment has been obtained on the
other. The legal basis for such reciprocity can be evidenced by (i) a treaty between Turkey and the
foreign jurisdiction providing for the reciprocal enforcement of court judgments, (ii) a provision in the
laws of the foreign jurisdiction permitting the enforcement in that jurisdiction of the judgments
rendered by Turkish courts or (iii) de facto enforcement in the foreign jurisdiction of the judgments
rendered by Turkish courts;

    - the foreign judgment must be final and binding, with no recourse to appeal (or similar review
processes) in the jurisdiction where the judgment has been obtained;

    - the subject matter of the dispute must not fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Turkey;

    - the foreign judgment must not be incompatible with a Turkish judgment between the same parties and
pertaining to the same issues. Moreover, and in certain circumstances, the foreign judgment must not
be incompatible with an earlier judgment obtained in the same foreign jurisdiction regarding the
relevant matter at hand and enforceable in Turkey (i.e. an earlier foreign judgment that satisfies the
enforceability criteria discussed here);

    - the judgment must not have been rendered by a foreign court that has deemed itself competent even
though it has no actual relationship with the parties or the subject matter at hand;

    - the judgment must be of a civil nature;

    - the foreign judgment must not violate any Turkish public policy rules; and

    - due process must have been followed in the jurisdiction where the foreign judgment has been obtained,
whereby the party against whom the enforcement of the judgment is sought, must have been “duly
served” or must have been made fully aware of the proceedings and given the full opportunity to
represent/defend itself in the trial or he/she should not object the enforcement request before Turkish
courts.

There is currently no treaty between the United States and Turkey providing for the reciprocal enforcement
of judgments. There is no published precedent confirming de facto reciprocity between United States and Turkey.
There is uncertainty as to enforceability of US court judgements in Turkey in the future since de facto reciprocity
is decided by the relevant court on a case-by-case basis and may vary based on each independent state.
Moreover, in practice, it would be difficult to execute a foreign court decision in Turkey, if the foreign court
decision does not include a clear monetary order.

In any suit or action against a Turkish Guarantor in the Turkish courts a foreign plaintiff may be required to
deposit security for court costs (cautio judicatum solvi), provided however that the court may at its discretion

277


-----

waive such requirement for security if the plaintiff is considered to be (i) a national of one of the contracting
states of the Convention Relating to Civil Procedures signed at The Hague on 1 March 1954 (ratified by Turkey
by Law No. 1574) or (ii) a national of a state that has signed a bilateral treaty with Turkey which is duly ratified
and contains, inter alia, a waiver of the cautio judicatum solvi requirement on a reciprocal basis.

**CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE**
**GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW**
**CONSIDERATIONS**

_The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited under applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity_
_and enforceability. The following is a brief description of limitations on the validity and enforceability of the_
_Guarantees and the Collateral and of certain insolvency law considerations with respect to the jurisdictions in_
_which Guarantees or Collateral are being provided or in which the Guarantors or providers of Collateral are_
_organized or have their registered office. The descriptions below do not purport to be complete or discuss all of_
_the limitations or considerations that may affect the Notes, the Guarantees or other security interests._
_Proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in_
_the jurisdiction of organization of a future Guarantor of the Notes and/or other jurisdictions where the relevant_
_entity conducts economic activity. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger_
_disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights_
_and to collect payment in full under the Notes, the Guarantees and the security interests on the Collateral._
_Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations and_
_considerations. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure” and “Risk Factors—_
_Risks Related to Our Financial Profile.” If additional collateral is required to be granted in the future pursuant_
_to the Indenture, such collateral will also be subject to limitations and enforceability and validity, which may_
_differ from those discussed below._

**European Union**

The Issuer, certain Guarantors and certain providers of Collateral are organized under the laws of Member
States of the European Union.

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (the “EU Insolvency
**Regulation”), which applies within the European Union (other than Denmark and other than in respect of certain**
insurance, credit institution and investment undertakings), the court that shall have jurisdiction to open
insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where
the company concerned has its “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where such company has its centre of main interests is generally a
question of fact on which the courts of different EU Member States, despite decisions of the ECJ on such matters,
may have differing and even conflicting views.

The term “centre of main interests” is not a static, but rather a fact and circumstances-based concept and
may therefore change from time to time. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation that a company has its centre of main interests in the Member State in which it has its
registered office, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the centre of main interests of a debtor
should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and
which “is therefore ascertainable by third parties.” In that respect, factors such as the location at which board
meetings are held and the location where the company conducts the majority of its business, including the
perception of the company’s creditors of the center of the company’s business operations, may all be relevant in
determining where the company has its centre of main interests, with the company’s centre of main interests at
the time of initiation of the relevant insolvency proceedings being not only decisive for the international
jurisdiction of the courts of a certain Member State, but also for the insolvency laws applicable to these
insolvency proceedings because each court would, subject to certain exemptions, apply its local insolvency laws
(lex fori concursus).

If the centre of main interests of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its
registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency
Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be
entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency
Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be
recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be
opened in another Member State. If the centre of main interests of a debtor is in one Member State (other than
Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than
Denmark) have jurisdiction to open secondary (or “territorial”) insolvency proceedings only in the event that
such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State within the meaning of Article 2(h)

279


-----

of the EU Insolvency Regulation. An “establishment” is defined as a place of operations where the company
carries on non-transitory economic activity with human means and goods. The effects of those secondary
insolvency proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor located in the territory of such other Member
State. If the main insolvency proceedings have been opened by the court of the EU Member State where the
centre of main interests of the debtor is situated, and are outstanding, then the secondary proceedings can only be
one of the winding-up proceedings listed in Annex B to the EU Insolvency Regulation. If the company does not
have an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open
secondary insolvency proceedings in respect of such issuer or guarantor under the EU Insolvency Regulation.
Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the company has its centre of main interests have not yet
been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can be opened in another Member State where the company has
an establishment only if either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the
company’s centre of main interests is situated as a result of conditions laid down by that Member State’s law; or
(b) the secondary insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor that is domiciled, habitually
resident or has its registered office in the Member State in which the company has an establishment or whose
claim arises from the operation of that establishment. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are
main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be
governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court which has assumed jurisdiction for
the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.

In the event that the Issuer or any provider of collateral experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be commenced,
or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations
of the Issuer and the collateral provided by the Issuer or any other company. The insolvency, administration and
other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially
different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the
potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.

The EU Insolvency Regulation does not contain specific rules dealing with the insolvency of a multinational
group of companies which generally means that separate proceedings must be opened for each individual
member of the group and that these proceedings may be entirely independent of each other and governed by
different jurisdictions. The lack of specific provisions for group insolvency may diminish the prospects of
successful restructuring of the group of companies as a whole and may lead to a break-up of the group in its
constituting parts. The European Commission has released a draft proposal for a regulation amending the EU
Insolvency Regulation providing, inter alia, for a coordination of the insolvency proceedings concerning
different members of the same group. It is currently unclear if and when, and whether in its proposed or modified
form, this proposal might be adopted as regulation.

**Austria**

Certain Guarantors are or may be organized under the laws of Austria, may have their centre of main
interests in Austria or may at least have assets located in Austria. In the event of insolvency, insolvency
proceedings may, therefore, be opened against such Guarantors in Austria which are governed by the Austrian
Insolvency Act (Insolvenzordnung).

Noteholders’ rights might also be affected by the Austrian Business Reorganisation Act
(Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz), which does not govern insolvency proceedings but regulates the
reorganization of companies in financial distress.

The Austrian Insolvency Act regulates on the one hand bankruptcy proceedings in which the debtor’s assets
or company as a whole are sold and the proceeds are distributed among its creditors. On the other hand it also
provides for restructuring proceedings enabling the debtor to discharge its liabilities through quota payments and
to continue its activities under certain conditions.

The Business Reorganization Act, which regulates reorganization proceedings for enterprises threatened by
insolvency, is not designed to assist creditors in satisfying their debts, but rather to support the reorganization of
the debtor’s enterprise. The insolvency laws of Austria may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as
the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions including in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain
post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings. As a result, your ability to recover payments
due on the Notes may be limited to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

**_Insolvency_**

In the event of insolvency of a Guarantor or provider of collateral organized under the laws of Austria and/
or having its centre of main interests in Austria at the time the application for the opening of insolvency
proceedings is filed, Austrian insolvency law would most likely govern such proceedings.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Austria.

**_Austrian Insolvency Proceedings_**

In respect of the insolvency of companies, the Austrian Insolvency Act provides the legal framework for
three forms of insolvency proceedings (actually one uniform proceeding with three names depending on the
procedural route taken):

    - bankruptcy proceedings (Konkursverfahren), for which a bankruptcy administrator (Masseverwalter) is
appointed;

    - restructuring proceedings without self-administration (Sanierungsverfahren ohne Eigenverwaltung),
for which a bankruptcy administrator is also appointed and in which only a few provisions differ from
those for a bankruptcy proceedings; and

    - restructuring proceedings with self-administration (Sanierungsverfahren unter Eigenverwaltung),
which are designed as a special form of restructuring proceedings and for which a restructuring
administrator (Sanierungsverwalter) is appointed to monitor the activities of the debtor. In such case,
certain transactions are either subject to the restructuring administrator’s approval or may be performed
only by the restructuring administrator.

While bankruptcy proceedings aim at the debtor’s liquidation (the sale of the whole insolvency estate and
distribution of sales proceeds), restructuring proceedings aim at the preservation of the debtor as a going concern.
To that end, a restructuring plan (Sanierungsplan) must be prepared by the debtor and presented to its unsecured
creditors for approval. Such restructuring plan presented in the course of restructuring proceedings with selfadministration must offer satisfaction of all preferred claims and at least 30% of the insolvency claims payable
within two years. In case of a restructuring plan to be adopted in the course of restructuring proceedings without
self-administration, the minimum quota is lowered to 20%.

If the adopted restructuring plan is fulfilled, the debtor is discharged of all its past debts.

A debtor is deemed insolvent if one or both of the following applies: (i) if it is illiquid, i.e. it is unable to pay
its debts as and when they fall due and payable, provided that such payment delay is not only temporary where
there is a high probability that liquid funds will be available in the near future (the cash flow test). Courts allow
the debtor a grace period, which (depending on the court) may take up to three months to overcome its payment
delays before they consider the debtor illiquid; and/or (ii) if the debtor is over-indebted, i.e. : liabilities on the
debtor’s balance sheet exceed the assets, in the presence of a negative going concern forecast (negative
_Fortbestandsprognose) (the balance sheet test). Insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzverfahren) must be opened by_
a court in the event that the debtor is insolvent.

The effective date of insolvency is the date on which the debtor is, as a matter of fact, insolvent. The
effective date is crucial with respect to a number of issues, including managing directors’ obligation to file for
the opening of insolvency proceedings and the beginning of hardening periods.

The debtor is obliged, “without culpable delay,” to apply for the opening of insolvency proceedings no later
than 60 days after the insolvency effective date. During this 60-day period, the managing directors may make
reasonable efforts to prepare for a filing of restructuring proceedings or agree with the creditors on an out-of
court settlement. Typically, the insolvency proceedings are opened immediately upon application by the debtor.
Further, in the case that a debtor is at imminent risk of being unable to pay its debts when they fall due (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit), the debtor may (but is not obliged to) apply for the opening of restructuring proceedings._
A creditor may also file for the opening of insolvency proceedings but will have to demonstrate that the debtor is
insolvent or over-indebted. In the case of an imminent risk of insolvency, a creditor may, however, not initiate
the opening of insolvency proceedings.

The initiation of insolvency proceedings brings about substantive and procedural law effects as of the
beginning of the day (0:00 a.m.) that follows the publication of the court’s order to open such proceedings in the

281


-----

official online insolvency data base (www.edikte.justiz.gv.at). As of this point in time, the managing directors
lose the power to dispose over the insolvency estate—except in respect to legal acts in the course of ordinary
business undertaken in restructuring proceedings with self-administration—and legal acts by the managing
directors performed thereafter are ineffective as far as the creditors are concerned. In particular, the following are
the most important effects:

Contracts may be terminated. As a general rule, bilateral agreements are not automatically terminated in
case of the opening of insolvency proceedings. However, in a case where a bilateral agreement has not been fully
fulfilled by both the debtor and the other party to such agreement, the insolvency administrator has the choice
whether to continue and fulfil such agreement or to prematurely terminate such agreement within a certain time
period to be set by the court upon application of one of the parties.

Further, any appointment as a legal representative (Vollmachtsnehmer) or as an agent (Auftragnehmer)
granted by a debtor will cease to be valid upon the opening of insolvency proceedings over its assets.

Additionally, the insolvency administrator has certain preferential rights to terminate employment contracts
in case the debtor’s enterprise or a part thereof is closed or downsized during insolvency proceedings.

A debtor’s contractual partner must not terminate contracts concluded with the debtor for a period of six
months if such termination could endanger the continuation of the debtor’s business.

Pursuant to section 25b para 2 of the Austrian Insolvency Act, a contractual stipulation providing for the
right to withdraw from the agreement or for an automatic termination in the event of opening of insolvency
proceedings (Insolvenzverfahren) against the other party is not enforceable by the debtor’s contractual partner.

Any individual enforcement action brought against the debtor’s assets by any of its unsecured creditors is
subject to an automatic stay upon the opening of insolvency proceedings.

The title owner (Eigentümer) or the economic owner (in case of a trust relationship (Treuhandschaft)) of an
asset in the possession of the debtor at the time of the opening of insolvency proceedings has a right of separation
(Aussonderungsrecht) with regard to its assets. Such separation assets (Aussonderungsgut) do not form part of
the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) and the relevant creditor can (subject to a six-month stay as described
below) require the surrender of its separation assets. During a period of six months after the opening of
insolvency proceedings, the owners’ claims for surrender of its separation asset are stayed (that is a legal respite
becomes effective) if such surrender would endanger the continuation of the business conduct of the debtor
provided that, among other things, such stay does not cause a severe personal or economic harm to the owner.

Creditor’s rights secured by a right in rem over the debtor’s assets or any part thereof (for example, by a
mortgage or pledge over bank accounts, receivables, movables) are not affected by the opening of insolvency
proceedings. This, however, requires prior perfection of the establishment of the security interest (subject to a
six-month stay as described below). Such secured creditors have a right of preferential satisfaction
(Absonderungsrecht) with regard to charged assets (Absonderungsgut) and are as such entitled to satisfy their
claims out of the enforcement proceeds with regard to such charged assets. To the extent the net enforcement
proceeds exceed the amount of secured claims, the excess proceeds are distributed to the unsecured creditors on a
_pro rata basis._

As is the case with the right to separation, the right of preferential satisfaction of a secured creditor may be
subject to a compulsory stay for a period of six months.

Secured creditors who are not only secured by a charged asset, but also have a direct claim for payment
against the debtor may participate with their claims which are not covered by the charged asset in the pro rata
distribution of the insolvency estate in a bankruptcy proceedings or in the restructuring plan.

The rights of a secured creditor depend on the type of its right of preferential satisfaction. If no compulsory
stay applies or once the six month period has expired, the secured creditor can assert its claim outside of
insolvency proceedings in regular court. The proceeds from the realization serve the preferred satisfaction of the
secured claims.

A creditor is entitled to exercise its rights of set-off and netting in the course of insolvency proceedings;
however, leaving aside certain derivatives and other financial/treasury transactions, such rights are restricted to

282


-----

claims that have been compensable at the time of the opening of insolvency proceedings. A creditor’s claim that
has not become due at the time of the opening of insolvency proceedings, as well as a creditor’s claim that is
subject to a condition, are compensable by operation of law.

As a general rule, the debtor’s enterprise (as well as its assets) must not be sold in the course of restructuring
proceedings since restructuring proceedings aim at the preservation of the debtor as a going concern. In contrast,
bankruptcy proceedings aim at the liquidation of the debtor through the sale of its assets.

A bankruptcy administrator is only appointed upon the opening of bankruptcy proceedings and restructuring
proceedings without self-administration whereby the managing directors lose control over the debtor. In case of
restructuring proceedings with self-administration the managing directors stay in control of the debtor; however,
a restructuring administrator having a right to veto certain transactions out of the ordinary business is appointed.
Under the supervision of the insolvency court and the creditors’ committee, the insolvency administrator is acting
in the interest of all creditors and its main functions are evaluating the merits of insolvency claims filed by
creditors; deciding on whether the debtor’s business may be continued; examining whether a restructuring plan is
in the common interest of all creditors; distribution of liquidation proceeds; and, in case of a bankruptcy
administrator, the management of the debtor’s business (for certain transactions not part of the ordinary business,
the consent of the creditors’ committee or insolvency court is required).

As a general rule, the insolvency estate consists of all of the debtor’s assets with a monetary value at the
time of the opening of insolvency proceedings and all assets which have been acquired during such proceedings.

**_Voidance Rights_**

In the event of insolvency proceedings, the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) (in case of
restructuring proceedings with debtor’s asset management (Sanierungsverfahren unter Eigenverantwortung) the
restructuring administrator (Sanierungsverwalter)) can contest legal actions and transactions which have taken
place within certain suspective periods prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings over the assets of the
debtor (each such period referred to herein as a “hardening period”) and which relate to the assets of the
insolvent (illiquid or over-indebted) debtor, provided that (i) the avoidance results in an increase of the
insolvency estate (Befriedigungstauglichkeit), (ii) the challenged legal action or transaction has caused a direct or
indirect discrimination of the other creditors (Gläubigerbenachteiligung), (iii) one of the special conditions
outlined below is fulfilled and (iv) the avoidance claim is filed within one year after the opening of the
insolvency proceedings.

Legal acts (Rechtshandlungen) may be contested:

    - if they have caused disadvantage (Benachteiligung) to the creditors of the debtor, and

    - if the debtor’s intention to cause disadvantage must have been known (where slight negligence (leichte
_Fahrlässigkeit) of the counterparty is sufficient) to the counterparty,_

provided that such legal acts have been carried out during a hardening period of two years. If the counterpart
had actual knowledge of such intention to cause disadvantage, such hardening period is extended to ten years.

In case the debtor and the counterpart are members of the same affiliated group, the burden of proof is eased
in favor of the contesting insolvency administrator since the respective creditor of the debtor must prove that it
did not know of the debtor’s intention to cause disadvantage to its creditors.

The intention to cause disadvantage is fulfilled not only if the satisfaction of another creditor is prevented
but also when it is delayed or aggravated.

Purchase, barter and delivery agreements (Kauf-, Tausch- und Lieferverträge) may be contested:

    - if they have caused disadvantage (Benachteiligung) to the creditors of the debtor; and

    - if the debtor’s intention to fraudulently convey its assets (Vermögensverschleuderungsabsicht) (e.g.,
selling the purchased shares for an unusual and unjustified low price) under such agreements must have
been known to the counterpart,

provided that such agreements have been concluded during a hardening period of one year.

Transactions free of charge (unentgeltliche Verfügungen) may be contested, provided that such transactions
have been concluded during a hardening period of two years.

283


-----

If any of the following acts in relation to the providing of security interests or the satisfaction of claims
occurred 60 days prior to or after the debtor had become insolvent (illiquid or overindebted) or insolvency
proceedings had been opened over the debtor’s assets:

    - creditor has obtained a security interest regarding, or the satisfaction of, a claim to which such creditor
was not entitled to receive in this way or at this time except in case such creditor has not been
preferentially treated as compared to other creditors of the debtor; or

    - the debtor has provided a creditor with a security interest or satisfied a claim with the intention to
preferentially treat (Begünstigungsabsicht) such creditor if such creditor knew or must have known of
the debtor’s intent to preferentially treat such creditors,

such legal acts of the debtor can be contested provided that such acts were undertaken within a hardening
period of one year.

If any of the following legal acts (Rechtshandlungen) were undertaken after the debtor had become illiquid
(zahlungsunfähig) or insolvency proceedings had been open over the debtor’s assets:

    - legal acts (Rechtshandlungen) providing a security interest to, or the satisfaction of, a claim vis-à-vis
an insolvency creditor and any legal transactions (Rechtsgeschäfte) entered into by the debtor with any
third party to the direct detriment (unmittelbarer Nachteil) of its other creditors, if such third party
counterpart knew or must have known of the debtor’s insolvency (illiquidity or over-indebtedness) or
the opening of insolvency proceedings; In case the debtor and the counterpart are members of the same
affiliated group, the burden of proof is eased in favor of the contesting insolvency administrator since
the respective creditor of the debtor must prove that it did not know of the debtor’s insolvency; or

    - any legal transactions (Rechtsgeschäfte) entered into by the debtor with any third party to the indirect
detriment (mittelbarer Nachteil) of its other creditors, if such third party counterpart knew or must
have known of the debtor’s insolvency (illiquidity or over-indebtedness) or the opening of insolvency
proceedings provided that the occurrence of such detriment for the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse)
was objectively foreseeable. Such indirect detriment to other creditors is in particular foreseeable in the
presence of an unfit restructuring concept (offensichtlich untaugliches Restrukturierungskonzept),

such legal acts of the debtor can be contested provided that such legal acts (Rechtshandlungen) were
undertaken within a hardening period of six months.

Outside of insolvency proceedings, creditors can use the rights of contestation granted to them by the
Austrian Act on Avoidance of Legal Transactions (Anfechtungsordnung). However, this act limits the right of
contestation to transactions similar to those mentioned above of the Austrian Insolvency Act.

The claim for contestation can be filed by any creditor whose claim against the debtor has not been satisfied
by the proceedings under the Austrian Enforcement Act (Exekutionsordnung) or is not likely to be satisfied by
such proceedings. The relevant point in time is not the formal opening of insolvency proceedings, but the filing
of the contestation claim with the competent court. The time period can be extended through notification
procedure by the court. The rights of contestation under the Austrian Act on Avoidance of Legal Transaction
may be exercised by any creditor.

**_The Austrian Business Reorganisation Act (Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz)_**

The Austrian Business Reorganisation Act (Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz) governs business
reorganizations, which are designed to enable businesses in temporary financial distress to continue to do
business after having undergone a reorganization procedure. Only the debtor may apply for the opening of a
reorganization procedure, provided, however, that it is still solvent at the time of its application. The relevant
criteria for the opening of a business reorganization procedure are the quota of own funds (Eigenmittelquote) of
less than 8% and a fictitious duration of debt redemption period (fiktive Schuldentilgungsdauer) of more than 15
years, each as defined in, and determined in accordance with, the Business Reorganization Act. Failure to timely
apply for the opening of reorganization proceedings may result in personal liability of the representatives of the
relevant company. Pursuant to section 19 of the Austrian Business Reorganization Act, a contractual stipulation
providing for the right to withdraw from an agreement or for its automatic termination in the event of the opening
of reorganization proceedings relating to the other party is not enforceable.

**_Equity Replacement Law_**

The Austrian Substitute Equity Act (Eigenkapitalersatz-Gesetz) contains detailed provisions regarding
equity replacing shareholder loans. It in particular stipulates that a loan granted by a “shareholder” to its
subsidiary which is in a financial crisis (i.e., the subsidiary is insolvent, over-indebted or the requirements of a
business reorganization procedure are met, see above at The Austrian Business Reorganisation Act
_(Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz)) is deemed to be recharacterized as equity. In a financial crisis such_
recharacterized shareholder loans (i.e., principal amount and any interest accrued thereupon) may not be repaid
and any security granted in connection with such loans may not be enforced until the borrowing/guaranteeing
subsidiary has been reorganized or restructured. This means in particular that in an insolvency the respective
claims of the shareholder lender are subordinated (i.e., there is no right for separation (Aussonderungsrecht) or a
right for preferential satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) for such claims). A “shareholder” is defined to be (i) a
shareholder with controlling participation, (ii) a shareholder with a participation of at least 25%, and (iii) any
person not holding a participation in the company but having a controlling influence (beherrschenden Einfluss)
with regard to the company. Furthermore, a person granting a loan/credit to a company is to be considered as
“shareholder” if (i) it holds a participation or other rights in a person other than the company receiving the loan/
credit which has a dominant (beherrschenden) influence regarding the company granted the loan/credit (indirect
controlling participation), or (ii) it indirectly holds a participation in the company receiving the loan/credit of at
least 33%, or (iii) it holds a controlling direct or indirect participation in a company which holds a participation
of at least 25% in the company receiving the loan/credit.

Prior to the enactment of the Austrian Substitute Equity Act, the Austrian Supreme Court had developed
even stricter rules on equity substituting shareholder loans. Following this, it is unclear whether, in addition to
the provisions of the Austrian Substitute Equity Act, such rules (or certain of its rules) developed by the Austrian
Supreme Court are still applicable/relevant and would be applied by Austrian courts.

**_Limitation on the Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees by Austrian Guarantors_**

_Capital Maintenance Rules_

Wittur Austria GmbH, Wittur GmbH (Austria) and Wittur Austria Holding GmbH are each incorporated in
the form of an Austrian company with limited liability (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung). Consequently,
the granting of guarantees as well as the assumption of certain obligations of other group companies by them is
subject to certain mandatory Austrian capital maintenance rules (“Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules”),
including, without limitation, section 82 et seq. of the Austrian Act on Limited Liability (Gesetz über
_Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung)._

Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules aim at preserving the capital of, among others, a company with limited
liability against unlawful distributions by such company to its shareholders. According to Austrian Capital
Maintenance Rules any direct or indirect distribution (a “Distribution”)—i.e., the entering into a business
transaction that provides for any value transfer, including, but without limitation, providing a guarantee or any
other security interest—to a shareholder, including to a third party upon request of a shareholder (e.g., to a
holding company (up-stream) or a sister company (side-stream)), without adequate consideration constitutes an
unlawful repayment of capital contributions (verbotene Einlagenrückgewähr) and, consequently, violates
Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules. Guarantees granted by an Austrian subsidiary in order to guarantee
liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered Distributions and may thus be held (in
whole or in part) invalid and unenforceable by Austrian courts if the granting of such guarantees were not at
arm’s length terms or for the Austrian subsidiary’s corporate benefit (see below).

A Distribution that does not provide for adequate consideration at first sight may, under certain
circumstances, not constitute a violation of the Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules if it is “commercially
justified (betrieblich gerechtfertigt).” Generally, a Distribution is deemed commercially justified (betrieblich
_gerechtfertigt) if a prudent business man (sorgfältig handelnder Geschäftsleiter) would have entered with an_
unrelated third party under the same circumstances into this particular transaction and at the same terms (so
called third party—or arm’s-length—test (Drittvergleich)). This needs, however, to be evaluated on a case by
case basis taking into account all particularities of the respective transaction and based on the assessment of the
overall benefit for the Austrian company; such corporate benefit may be e.g. the receipt of monetary
compensation or other benefits received by the Austrian company which may result from the overall transaction.

Any transaction violating Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules may be held (in whole or in part) null and
void by Austrian courts. Consequently, any direct or indirect shareholder (side-stream or up-stream) who has

285


-----

received any Distribution under such transaction may be liable to its Austrian (direct or indirect) subsidiary for
repayment of unlawfully received Distributions. The nullity may also affect a third party (e.g., noteholders) if
such third party knew or should have known (gross negligence) that the respective transaction was not permitted
pursuant to Austrian capital maintenance rules.

Consequently, to the extent a guarantee is provided by an Austrian subsidiary to guarantee liabilities of a
direct or indirect parent or sister company or any liability or obligation is assumed by an Austrian subsidiary for
the benefit of such parent or sister company, it is standard market practice to include limitation language in the
relevant transaction documents (e.g. indentures, purchase agreements, guarantees etc.). Pursuant to such
limitation language the scope of the guarantee / assumption of liability, as far as the Austrian subsidiary is
concerned is limited to the extent permissible under Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules. No case law is
available to confirm and it is thus not certain whether these limitations would be valid and enforceable under
Austrian law and achieve the desired effect of legally preserving the guarantees to the extent possible or whether
the guarantees could be deemed void in their entirety.

Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules are subject to ongoing court decisions and it cannot be ruled out that
future court decisions may further limit the access of creditors and/or shareholders to assets of Austrian
subsidiaries, including, but without limitation, guarantees of Guarantors organized under Austrian laws, which
could negatively affect our ability to make payment on the Notes.

**_Banking Law Restrictions_**

The Austrian Banking Act (Bankwesengesetz) enumerates certain banking activities which, if conducted on
a commercial basis (gewerblich) in Austria require a local Austrian banking license or an appropriate license
duly “passported” into Austria based on the European law directive 2013/36/EU and covering such activities. In
addition, the Austrian Securities Supervision Act 2007 (Wertpapieraufsichtsgesetz 2007), enumerates certain
activities which qualify as investment services and investment activities which, if conducted on a commercial
basis (gewerblich) in Austria require a local Austrian investment services license or an appropriate EU license
duly “passported” into Austria based on the European law directive 2004/39/EC, as amended, and covering such
activities.

Besides any entity licensed by the Austrian supervisory authority to conduct regulated activities within the
meaning of the Banking Act and the Securities Supervisory Act credit institutions or investment firms,
respectively, authorized in a member state of the European Economic Area (EEA), may conduct certain of the
regulated activities in Austria. Any such entity may conduct the relevant activities in Austria either by the
establishment of a branch office or by way of the freedom to provide services, insofar as such activities are
authorized under the legal provisions of the Member State of incorporation and the relevant notification
procedure in line with the European law directive 2013/26/EU or the European law directive 2004/39/EC,
respectively, and the relevant local laws have been complied with. Accordingly, any entity which intends to
conduct activities regulated by the Austrian Banking Act or the Securities Supervision Act in Austria or, from
outside of Austria, into Austria on a commercial basis, requires a respective license or successful completion of
EEA notification procedures. The conducting of such regulated activities in Austria without the necessary license
or successful completion of EEA notification procedures can trigger in particular administrative fines and civil
law sanctions. The Banking Act and the Securities Supervision Act, respectively, provide that whoever conducts
banking transactions (a) set out in Art. 4 para 1 no 1 of European law regulation 575/2013 (i.e. taking deposits
and granting credit) without the required authorization is guilty of an administrative offence and may be subject
to an administrative fine of up to EUR 5 million or up to twice the benefit derived from such violation, in case
the benefit can be quantified or (b) other banking/investment services transactions without the required
authorization is guilty of an administrative offence and may be subject to an administrative fine of up to EUR
100,000. Furthermore, the laws provide that whoever conducts such regulated activities unlicensed shall not be
entitled to any compensation connected with such activities (e.g. interests, commissions, fees, etc.); sureties
(Bürgschaften) and guarantees granted in connection therewith are ineffective. Furthermore, a civil law suits for
unfair competition by competitors are possible. The transaction (agreement) itself, however, remains valid.

**_Stamp Duty_**

Under the Austrian Stamp Duty Act (Gebührengesetz), stamp duty is triggered upon the creation of a
document (Urkunde; a term which has a technical meaning within the context of the Stamp Duty Act) on certain
dutiable transactions enumerated in the Stamp Duty Act. Dutiable transactions include, e.g., lease agreements,
sureties, assignments, mortgages.

286


-----

According to the Austrian Stamp Duty Act, stamp duty on, e.g.:

(a) sureties (Bürgschaft) amounts to 1% of the guaranteed amount (a guarantee may be treated as a surety
for stamp duty purposes if the guarantor under the guarantee does not explicitly waive all claims,
remedies or defences with respect to the underlying guaranteed transaction); and

(b) assignments amounts to 0.8% of the consideration for the assignment, or, in case of an assignment for
security (Sicherungszession), 0.8% of the higher of the secured amount and the value of the assigned
receivables. Assignments as security transaction (Sicherungszession) may—if certain prerequisites are
met—benefit from an exemption pursuant to the Austrian Stamp Duty Act.

Basically, Austrian stamp duty is triggered if a document on a dutiable transaction is created in Austria.
Under certain circumstances, the creation of a document on a dutiable transaction outside of Austria may trigger
stamp duty. In this case, stamp duty may generally be triggered if (i) the parties to the transaction are resident for
stamp duty purposes in Austria (Austrian residence, place of habitual abode, seat, place of effective management
or permanent establishment) and (ii) the transaction concerns an Austrian situated asset or a party to the
transaction is entitled or obliged to performance under the transaction in Austria.

If the creation of a document outside of Austria did not trigger Austrian stamp duty, stamp duty may be
triggered if the document (or a certified copy thereof) is imported into Austria and (i) the transaction concerns an
Austrian situated asset or a party to the transaction is entitled or obliged to performance under the transaction in
Austria, or (ii) a legally relevant action is taken in Austria based on the transaction or official use of the
document (or a certified copy thereof) is made in Austria.

Austrian stamp duty may also be triggered by a document that refers to a dutiable transaction in a qualified
manner (so called confirming document; rechtsbezeugende Urkunde). According to the Austrian Federal
Ministry of Finance, a confirming document within the present context is constituted if the parties to and the
nature of the transaction referred to may be derived from the document. Such document may (already) trigger
Austrian stamp duty if signed by one of the parties and sent to the other party or its representative (or, in case of a
transaction under which both parties are obliged to performance, a third party in order to furnish proof of the
underlying transaction). Further, stamp duty may be triggered by a so called substitute document (Ersatzurkunde;
e.g., a signed protocol on an orally agreed transaction) on a dutiable transaction or a document that incorporates
by reference a document on a dutiable transaction.

If Austrian stamp duty is triggered, pursuant to the Stamp Duty Act generally the parties to the transaction
are jointly and severally liable for the amount of Austrian stamp duty triggered. In case of a transaction under
which only one party is obliged to performance, the party in whose interest the document was created is liable for
the stamp duty (e.g., the beneficiary in case of a surety). In any case, the other party (as well as, if the competent
tax office is not duly notified of the dutiable transaction, the persons who would be responsible for such
notification) would be secondarily liable for the stamp duty triggered. Agreements between the parties as to who
shall bear stamp duty if triggered are not binding on the tax authorities but may be honored by the tax authorities
within their discretion.

If stamp duty was triggered and not duly paid or the competent tax office was not duly notified of a dutiable
transaction, the competent tax office may, within its discretion, increase the amount of stamp duty due by up to
100 per cent, depending on whether the taxpayer could have recognized that stamp duty was triggered, the
notification was made with slight or substantial delay, or provisions of the Stamp Duty Act have been infringed
for the first time or repeatedly.

**_Appointment of a Curator_**

Pursuant to the Act on Curators regarding Partial Debentures (Kuratorengesetz), a curator may be appointed
as representative for the holders of partial debentures (Teilschuldverschreibungen) by the competent court under
specific circumstances, in particular if rights of holders of such partial debentures might be endangered due to the
lack of common representation. Following this, in general and with regard to the scope of the representation by
the curator, the respective holders of such partial debentures may not exert their rights arising out of the partial
debentures on their own as such rights are then exerted by the curator; however, they are in general entitled to
accede to the respective legal proceedings initiated by the curator against the Issuers as intervenors
(Nebenintervenient).

287


-----

**England and Wales**

**_Applicable Insolvency Law_**

The UK guarantor is incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Accordingly, main insolvency
proceedings with respect to this entity would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency
law (unless that company’s centre of main interests for the purposes of the EU Insolvency Regulations on
insolvency proceedings (“COMI”) is (at the time such proceedings are commenced) in an EU member state
other than the United Kingdom in which case the laws of that jurisdiction will, subject to certain exceptions,
govern the relevant insolvency proceedings). Main proceedings are insolvency proceedings commenced in the
member state in which the debtor has its COMI and have effect throughout the EU. English insolvency law may
not be as favorable to investors’ interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which
investors are more familiar. In the event that the UK guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible
to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings.

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways,
including by the company, its directors or a creditor making an application for administration to the court, the
company, its directors or a holder of a “qualifying floating charge” appointing an administrator out of court by
filing a notice in court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company resolving to do
so (in the case of liquidation). One of the grounds on which a company may be wound up is if it is unable to pay
its debts, and may be placed into administration if it is, or is likely, to become unable to pay its debts, and the
administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes.

Under the Insolvency Act 1986, as amended (the “Insolvency Act”), a company is deemed to be unable to
pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that it is unable to
pay its debts as they fall due), if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (it is proved to the satisfaction of the
court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its
contingent and prospective liabilities), if it fails to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750
within the specified time or if it fails to satisfy in full a judgment debt (or similar court order).

The UK guarantor’s obligations under the Notes are secured by security interests over the Collateral.
English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a Guarantee against the UK
guarantor and the enforceability of security interests over the Collateral.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain
limitations on the UK guarantee and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of these laws could
adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the UK guarantee and/or the security
documents and/or the Collateral securing the Notes (as the case may be) and the UK guarantee and therefore may
limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of the UK guarantor.

**_Fixed versus Floating Charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security:
(a) an administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such
cash, or use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet certain, statutory administration expenses (which can
include the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging company) while in administration in
priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating
charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the charged assets; (c) general costs and expenses
(including the remuneration of the insolvency officeholders) properly incurred in a winding-up or administration
are generally payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets that are the subject of the
floating charge) in priority to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company
is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business,
meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third-party good
title to the assets free of the floating charge; (e) there are particular insolvency “clawback” risks in relation to
floating charge security (see “—Grant of Floating Charge”); and (f) floating charge security is subject to the
claims of certain preferential creditors (such as employee, where the floating charge is not a security financial
collateral arrangement, salary claims (up to a cap per employee), employee holiday claims and certain unpaid
pension contributions) and to ring-fencing for unsecured creditors up to the statutory limit
(see “—Administration and Floating Charges”).

Under English insolvency law, there is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests
expressed to be created by a security document could take effect as floating charges because the description

288


-----

given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed
rather than floating security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the chargee has the requisite
degree of control over the ability of the relevant chargor to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof
and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the
secured assets without the consent of the chargee, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question
constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

**_Administration and Floating Charges_**

The Insolvency Act empowers English courts to make an administration order in respect of an English
company or a company with its COMI in England in certain circumstances. An administration order can be made
if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and that the
administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. An administrator can also be
appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge, and different
procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. The purpose of an administration is comprised of
three parts that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not
reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than immediate
liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole
are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to secured or preferential
creditors.

During the administration, in general, no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or
continued against the company, or security enforced over the company’s property, except with leave of the court
or the consent of the administrator. Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their
security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of
the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral agreement” (generally, cash or
financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under
the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended). If an English company were to
enter administration, it is possible that, to the extent that it is not a financial collateral arrangement, the security
granted by it or the guarantee granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration. In addition, other
than in limited circumstances, a secured creditor will not be entitled to appoint an administrative receiver and any
already appointed must vacate office on the making of an administration order against the company in
administration. If the company is already in administration no other receiver may be appointed.

In order to empower the Shared Security Agent to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to
the company out of court, the floating charge granted by the relevant English obligor must constitute a
“qualifying floating charge” for purposes of English insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an
administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates
September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the Insolvency Act as amended by the Enterprise Act
2002 to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order to constitute a qualifying floating
charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision
applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports to
empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the
Insolvency Act. The Security Agent will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge
security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the
property of the relevant English company and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge.
The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception
relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the
Notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant company under the arrangement and the
arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, and is
generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and
not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying charge using the out of court procedure) in certain
circumstances. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of
part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator.

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver in certain circumstances) or liquidator of the
company will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating
charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors after making full provision for preferential creditors and

289


-----

expenses (floating charge realizations). Under current law, this applies to 50 per cent of the first £10,000 of net
property (the amount of a company’s property which would otherwise have been available for satisfaction of
claims of a holder of a debenture secured by or holders of floating charges created by the company) and 20 per
cent of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £600,000. Whether the assets that are
subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of the relevant English
company’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time.

**_Liquidation/Winding Up_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of the company are realized and
distributed by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act. At the
end of the liquidation process the company will be dissolved. In the case of a liquidation commenced by way of a
court order, there is a stay on the commencement or continuation of proceedings against the company except by
leave of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose (although security enforcement is not
affected).

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property, which is any
unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to
a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it imposes
continuing financial obligations on the company that may be detrimental to creditors.

**_Challenges to Guarantees and Security_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of
security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the company is placed into
administration or liquidation within a specified period of the granting of the guarantee or security. Therefore, if
during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, the administrator
or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by such company. The Issuer cannot be
certain that, in the event of the onset of a UK Subsidiary’s insolvency that is within any of the requisite time
periods set forth below, the grant of any security or Guarantee will not be challenged or that a court would
uphold the transaction as valid.

**_Onset of Insolvency_**

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and
invalid floating charges, depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In administration the onset of
insolvency is the date on which (a) where an administrator is appointed by administration order, the date on
which the administration application is made or (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at
court, or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory
liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a
voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows
administration, the onset of insolvency will be as for the initial administration.

**_Connected Persons_**

A connected person for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating
charges, is a party who is a director, shadow director, an associate of such director, or an associate, of the
relevant company. A party is associated with an individual if a relative of the individual or the individual’s
husband, wife or civil partner, or the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual or the
individual’s husband, wife or civil partner. A party is associated with a company if employed by that company. A
company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has
control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the
other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the
same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member
of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to charges and guarantees include, without
limitation:

**_Transaction at an Undervalue_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the court
for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator

290


-----

believes that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. It will
only be a transaction at an undervalue if, at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the English
company is unable to pay its debts (as that term is defined in the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be
challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two
years from the date the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction might be
subject to being set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person, if the
company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money
or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. A court, however, generally will not intervene
if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its
business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit
it. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order
as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into. In
any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was unable to
pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in
which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the
English company in such proceedings.

**_Preference_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the court
for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator
believes that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. It will only be a
preference if, at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the English company was unable to
pay its debts. The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or administration
proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected
person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the English company takes the
decision to grant the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction may constitute a preference if it has the
effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or
liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor,
guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If the court
determines that the transaction was a preference, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the
position to what it would have been in if the preference had not been entered into. For the court to determine a
preference, however, it must be shown that the English company was influenced by a desire to produce the
preferential effect. In any proceeding, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English
company was unable to pay its debts and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential
effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption that
the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must
demonstrate in such proceeding that there was no such desire.

**_Transaction Defrauding Creditors_**

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was made
for the purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a
company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim that person is making or
may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This provision may
be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction, whether or not the company is insolvent or
in liquidation or administration (with the leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and
is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators and, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial
Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. There is no statutory time limit under English insolvency law
within which the challenge must be made and the relevant company does not need to be unable to pay its debts at
the time of or as a result of the transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction
defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have
been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The
relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the
person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in
property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without
notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in
good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a
party to the transaction.

**_Extortionate Credit Transaction_**

An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. The court
can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by an English obligor up to three years before the day on
which the English obligor entered into administration or went into liquidation. A transaction is “extortionate” if,
having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to
require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect
of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing.

**_Grant of Floating Charge_**

Under English insolvency law, if an English company is unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a result
of) granting the floating charge then such floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money
paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English
company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest). The requirement
for the English company to be unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge
does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. If the floating charge is granted to a
connected person then the floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or
goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English company at the
same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest), whether the relevant English
company is solvent or insolvent at the time of grant. The transaction can be challenged if the relevant English
company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of one year (if the beneficiary is
not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the relevant English
company grants the floating charge. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral
agreement” under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended), the floating
charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph. An administrator, or a liquidator (as
applicable), does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid. Any floating
charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid except to the extent of the value of the
money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English
company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest), whether the
relevant English company is solvent or insolvent at the time of grant.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The grant of a guarantee or security by any of the English obligors in respect of the obligations of another
group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by
the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow
such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void
and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are
dealing with an English obligor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its
interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English obligor in question by virtue of
entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act
in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English obligor for
the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient
commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be
vulnerable to being set aside by a court.

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts,
any debt of a company payable in a currency other than British Pounds (such as euro in the case of the Notes)
must be converted into British Pounds at the “official exchange rate” prevailing at the date when the company
went into liquidation or administration. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. The “official
exchange rate” for these purposes is the middle market rate in the London Foreign Exchange Market at close of
business as published for the date in question or, if no such rate is published, such rate as the court determines.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

The Issuer, certain Guarantors and certain providers of Collateral are or may be incorporated or established
under the laws of Germany, have their registered offices in Germany and substantially all of their assets are
located in Germany (the “German Entities”). Consequently, any insolvency proceedings with regard to the

292


-----

German Entities are likely to be initiated in Germany and if the German Entities were held to have their centre of
main interests within the territory of Germany at the time the application for the opening of insolvency
proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency law would most likely govern such
proceedings subject to the EU Insolvency Directive (see also “—European Union”). The insolvency laws of
Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as
favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in
respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as security interests and
the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and therefore may limit your ability to recover payments due on the
Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.

**_German Insolvency Proceedings_**

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court
ex officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings.
Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of the over-indebtedness
(Überschuldung) of the debtor if the debtor is a legal person (juristische Person) or any company not having an
individual as its personally liable shareholder or in the event that the debtor is illiquid, i.e. unable to pay its debts
as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency
Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on
their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business is predominantly likely (positive
_Fortbestehensprognose). If a legal person (juristische Person), e.g., a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit_
_beschränkter Haftung—GmbH) or any company not having an individual as its personally liable shareholder, gets_
into a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the management of such company and, under certain
circumstances, its shareholders are obligated to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue
delay, however, at the latest, within three weeks after the mandatory insolvency reason (i.e., illiquidity and/or
over-indebtedness), occurred. Noncompliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damage
claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit)
is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the debtor currently is able to service its payment
obligations, but will presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis
period. However, only management of the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the
opening of insolvency proceedings in case of imminent illiquidity.

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite
the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency
proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists a reason for the insolvency on the part of the
relevant entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency
proceedings (if any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of
companies in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. The
German Federal Ministry of Justice (Bundesjustizministerium) has released a draft Bill to Facilitate the Handling
of Group Insolvencies (Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen). It is
currently unclear if and when, and whether in its current or modified form, this Bill might be adopted by
parliament.

The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take
preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings
_(Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce_
individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the court will also
appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has petitioned
for the appointment of a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) in preparation of a debtor-in possession
proceeding (Eigenverwaltung)—an insolvency process in which the debtor’s management generally remains in
charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a preliminary custodian—with this
petition not being obviously futile. Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations, the insolvency
court must or may appoint a preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) to form a view
on the profile of the officeholder to be appointed or even to make a suggestion for a particular individual to be
appointed by the court. In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an
individual, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible; i.e.,
incompetent and/or not disinterested). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of

293


-----

all creditor constituencies, it shall comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large and one for
the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The duty of the preliminary insolvency administrator is, in
particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s assets (which includes the continuation of the business
carried out by the debtor) and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the
insolvency proceedings. Additionally, the duty of the preliminary insolvency administrator is to verify the
existence of reason for insolvency. The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency
proceedings (eröffnetes Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, particularly if there are sufficient
assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be
sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties, such as creditors,
advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (usually the same person
who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court unless a debtor-inpossession proceeding (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence of a debtor-in-possession proceeding, the
right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency
administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to change the individual
appointed as insolvency administrator upon the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly _(erste_
_Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount_
of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and
(ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder (i.e., he or she is sufficiently qualified, businessexperienced and impartial). The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other
liabilities to continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify
as preferential claims against the estate (Masseforderung) which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an
unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the
available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim).

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate
in the insolvency proceedings by filing their claims with the insolvency administrator. German insolvency
proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in
the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of
the German Insolvency Code. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential
rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest, entitlement to enforce such
security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be
noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any movable assets in his, her or the
debtor’s possession that are subject to preferential rights (such as liens over movable assets
_(Mobiliarsicherungsrechte), or security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims_
that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In the absence of authoritative case
law, it is uncertain whether in an insolvency of the entity holding the pledged shares the secured creditors are
entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of pledged shares on their own or whether the insolvency
administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. If the
enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory
charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets
_(Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% (or more in certain circumstances) of the_
gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any), are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the
relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the
debtor the insolvency administrator has first to satisfy the preferential creditors of the insolvency estate
_(Massegläubiger) (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred_
by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other unsubordinated
claims (insolvency claims) (Insolvenzforderungen), will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there
is cash remaining in the insolvent estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims
against the estate have been settled and paid in full. Therefore, the proceeds resulting from the realization of the
insolvency estate of the debtor may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors of the German Entities or
under a guarantee granted by the German Entities in full after the secured creditors have been satisfied. Claims of
subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after
the claims of other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully
satisfied.

294


-----

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the
debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking
below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion of their
amounts if ranked with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency
creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors
due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines,
as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offense binding the debtor to pay
money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a
shareholder loan or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan.

While in ordinary insolvency proceedings the value of the debtor’s assets is realized by a piecemeal sale or,
as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the debtor’s business as a going concern, a different approach aimed at the
rehabilitation of the debtor can be taken based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted
by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions,
the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and
the approval of the insolvency court. The insolvency court may order the deemed approval of one or more
opposing creditor groups under certain conditions (cram down). The insolvency plan may derogate from the
provisions of the German Insolvency Code. In particular, it may contain provision regarding the discharge of
secured and unsecured creditors, the disposal of the insolvency estate as well as procedure. It may also create,
modify, transfer or terminate rights in rem such as property rights or security interests. If the debtor is a corporate
entity, the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can also be included in the
insolvency plan, for example, these can be transferred to third parties, including a transfer to creditors based on a
debt-to-equity swap. Thus, an insolvency plan could under certain circumstances provide for provisions
regarding the Notes, the Guarantees or the Collateral which are less favorable to the holders of the Notes than the
provisions of the German Insolvency Code, such as the release of the Collateral, the release of obligations under
the Notes or the contribution of the Notes in exchange for equity. Under certain conditions, such provisions could
be adopted against the votes of the affected holders of the Notes. Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings based on a reason for the insolvency other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent
illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate such process based on a debtor-in
possession proceeding and can demonstrate that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile, the court
may grant a period of up to three months to draw up an insolvency plan for the debtor business
(Schutzschirmverfahren). During this period, the creditors’ rights to enforce security may—upon application of
the filing debtor—be suspended. Under these circumstances, the insolvency court must appoint a preliminary
custodian to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian
with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible
to become a custodian (i.e., he or she is obviously not competent or impartial).

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses”
entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the
opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of
reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings _(insolvenzbezogene_ _Kündigungsrechte_ _oder_
_Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not_
to perform the contract. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law.

**_Voiding of Transactions and Voidance Periods_**

Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator or custodian may void (anfechten)
transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were
effected prior to the commencement of formal insolvency proceedings during applicable voidance periods.
Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully voided by the insolvency administrator or
custodian, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act must be
returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator’s or custodian’s right to avoid transactions can, depending on
the circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings.

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer based on and governed by the insolvency
laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders of the Notes as well as the granting of collateral for
or providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency
administrator or custodian under the rules of avoidance as set forth in the German Insolvency Code. In case the
validity or enforceability of the Notes or any collateral in favor of the Notes is avoided successfully, you may not

295


-----

be able to recover any amounts under the Notes or the collateral. If payments have already been made under the
Notes or collateral, the insolvency administrator or custodian may require that the recipients return the payment
to the insolvency estate and you would instead then only have a general unsecured claim under the Notes without
preference in insolvency proceedings (unless and to the extent the collateral would not be subject to avoidance in
which case such claim would be secured to that extent).

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (which term includes the granting of a
guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be
voided according to the German Insolvency Code in the following cases:

    - any act granting a creditor security or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) can be voided if the
transaction was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings, if at the time of the transaction the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig),
which means such debtor was unable to pay its debt when due and the creditor had knowledge thereof
or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed and the creditor had
knowledge thereof or of the debtor being illiquid (or knowledge of circumstances which imperatively
suggesting such illiquidity or filing);

    - any act granting a creditor security or satisfaction for a debt to which such creditor had no right, no
right at the respective time or no right as to the respective manner, can be voided if the transaction was
effected in the month prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; if the
transaction was effected in the second and third month prior to the filing, it can be voided if at the time
of the transaction (i) the debtor was illiquid or (ii) the creditor knew that the transaction would be
detrimental to the creditors of the debtor;

    - any legal transaction effected by the debtor which is directly detrimental to the creditors of the debtor
can be voided if the transaction was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition
for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor, if at the time of the legal transaction the
debtor was illiquid and the other party to the legal transaction had knowledge thereof or (ii) after a
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed against the debtor and the other party
to the legal transaction had knowledge thereof or of the debtor being illiquid;

    - if an act whereby a debtor grants security for a third-party debt is regarded as having been granted
gratuitously (unentgeltlich), such gratuitous transaction can be voided unless it was effected earlier
than four years prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the
debtor;

    - any act performed by the debtor during a period of ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after such filing can be voided if the debtor acted
with the intent to disadvantage its creditors and the beneficiary of the transaction had knowledge of
such intent at the time of the transaction, with such knowledge being presumed if the beneficiary knew
that the debtor was at least imminent illiquid and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors;

    - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party which directly
operates to the detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded earlier than
two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party
had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was
concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” includes, subject to certain
limitations, members of management or the supervisory board, general partners and shareholders
owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable
positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other
persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons;

    - any act that provides security or satisfaction for a claim of a shareholder for the repayment of a
shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or an economically equivalent claim can be voided (i) in the
event it provided security, if the transaction was effected within the last ten years prior to the filing of a
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter or (ii) in the event it provided
satisfaction, if the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter; or

    - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a
third party can be voided if the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition
for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and if a shareholder of the debtor had granted
security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge) (in which case the shareholder must compensate the
insolvency estate for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

296


-----

For purposes of the above, the knowledge of circumstances from which a compelling conclusion regarding
the debtor’s illiquidity or regarding the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings can be
drawn, will be considered tantamount to the actual knowledge of the debtor’s illiquidity or of the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or custodian voiding transactions according to the
German Insolvency Code described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order
(Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the relevant security
right in accordance with the German Law of Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency
proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the voidance periods
are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of voidance in the courts.

In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing funding to a debtor
or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s (impending)
insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time such funding was
provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof)
held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally
influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores
(Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any
circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security was close to collapse
(Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The Issuer and the original Guarantors are incorporated in the form of a German limited liability company
(Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) Consequently, the Guarantees and the grant of collateral by them is
subject to certain provisions of the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaft
_mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbHG”)._

As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from
disbursing its assets to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets minus
liabilities and liability reserves) is already less or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital
(Stammkapital). The granting of guarantees, share pledges and other security by a GmbH in order to guarantee or
secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company may be considered disbursements under Sections
30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant guarantees and to create security interests
to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and
31, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain
so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH or a limited liability
partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) with a GmbH as its sole general partner (Komplementär) (“GmbH & Co.
**KG”) incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the**
guarantees and security interests agree, subject to certain exemptions, to require payments under the guarantee or,
as the case may be, enforce the security interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such
payment or, as the case may be, enforcement does not result in the GmbH’s (or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its
general partner’s) net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the case may be, if the net assets are
already below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such amount to be further reduced. Accordingly, the
Indenture, security documents and other relevant documents relating to the Guarantees and the Collateral
provided by the Issuer and the German Guarantors or other German security providers will contain such
limitation language and the relevant Guarantees and Collateral will be limited in the manner described. This
could lead to a situation in which the respective security granted by a GmbH or GmbH & Co KG cannot be
enforced at all.

German capital maintenance rules are subject to ongoing court decisions. Future court rulings may further
limit the access of shareholders to assets of their subsidiaries constituted in the form of a GmbH or a GmbH &
Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make payments on the Guarantees, of the
secured parties to enforce the Collateral or of the beneficiaries of the Guarantees to enforce the Guarantees.

Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation
where a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own
payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or security granted

297


-----

by a German (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer. In such a case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in
an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. Moreover, according to a decision of the German Federal
Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of
contract if a creditor knows about the stressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will
only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled
out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of the Guarantees and/or the
Collateral by the Issuer and the German Guarantors.

In addition, enforcement of the Guarantees and security interests granted by subsidiaries of the Issuer may
be limited under its respective terms to the extent that it would lead to the illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the
Issuer granting such Guarantee or security interest.

**_Parallel Debt/Pledges_**

Under German law, certain “accessory” security interests (akzessorische Sicherheiten) such as pledges
(Pfandrechte) may only be validly created in favor of the creditor(s) of the secured claims and the pledgor will
need to notify the relevant debtor of a pledged claim of such pledge in order to create a valid pledge.
Furthermore, the validity, extent and enforceability of a pledge are strictly linked (“accessory”) to the validity,
extent and enforceability of the secured claims. In particular, a pledge may cease to exist if the claims secured by
the pledge are transferred to new creditor(s) by way of novation or at a time when no amounts are outstanding
under the secured claims. Therefore, the security interests granted as pledges have been created in favor of the
relevant Security Agent acting in its capacity as creditor of parallel debt obligations (the “Parallel Debt”). The
Parallel Debt mirrors the amount and is payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors under the Notes and the Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”). Payments in respect of the
Principal Obligations will also discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and vice versa. Although the relevant
Security Agent will have, pursuant to the Parallel Debt, a claim against us for the full principal amount of the
Notes, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to enforce such security except through the relevant Security
Agent and will bear some risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the relevant Security
Agent. It is widely believed that a Parallel Debt can effectively be secured by a pledge. However, there are no
published court decisions confirming the validity of the Parallel Debt structure and of the Collateral granted
under German law to secure such Parallel Debt, and hence there is no certainty that German courts will give
effect and uphold such Collateral.

To the extent that parts of the Parallel Debt refer to certain future claims of certain creditors against the
Issuer or certain Guarantors and to the extent these creditors and/or the nature and/or basis of their claims is not
known and/or specifiable at the time of the Issuer or certain Guarantors granting the abstract acknowledgement
of debt, it is uncertain whether the Parallel Debt relating thereto will be recognized by a German court.

In addition, since German law does not generally allow for an appropriation of pledged assets by the
pledgee upon the occurrence of an enforcement event, an enforcement of a share pledge governed by German
law usually requires the sale of the relevant Collateral through a formal disposal process involving a public
auction. Certain waiting periods and notice requirements may apply for such disposal process.

**_Creditor Liability_**

The beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of the
guarantee or security could moreover become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German
Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if for example the creditor were to
act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of
the legal principle of contra bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of
the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee or security is close to
collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. Under such circumstances, the
granted security interests and/or Guarantees may also be invalid.

**Italy**

**_Certain Italian Insolvency Laws_**

Wittur Italia Holding S.r.l. and Wittur S.p.A. are incorporated in the Republic of Italy and, in case of an
insolvency event affecting any of these entities, insolvency or restructuring proceedings may be initiated in Italy
to the extent that the centre of main interests (“COMI”) of the companies provided for under EU Regulation

298


-----

1346/2000 is not located elsewhere. In Italy, the courts play an important role in the insolvency process and
in-court procedures may be materially more complex and time-consuming than in equivalent situations in
jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy. In the event that any of
Wittur Italia Holding S.r.l. and Wittur S.p.A. experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with
certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency, and/or restructuring proceedings would be commenced
(depending on the actual location of the COMI), or the outcome of such proceedings. Certain provisions of
Italian law have been amended or have entered into force only recently and, therefore, may be subject to further
implementation and/or interpretations and have not been tested to date in the Italian courts.

The two primary aims of Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 (the main Italian bankruptcy legislation),
as reformed and currently in force (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”), are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and
restructure its business protecting, where possible, the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction
of creditors’ claims. In case of the extraordinary administration procedure (governed by Legislative Decree
No. 270 of July 8, 1999, or, upon certain eligibility criteria of the debtor, Legislative Decree No. 347 of
December 23, 2003, converted, with modifications, into Law No. 39 of February 18, 2004, an additional primary
aim is to maintain employment. These aims have often been balanced by selling businesses as going concerns
and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian
Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation,
and a focus on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy
restructuring options.

Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency
(insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more
creditors. Insolvency occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they become due.
This must be a permanent, and not a temporary, status of insolvency in order for a court to hold that a company is
insolvent.

In cases where a company is in distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with
its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible to being reviewed by
a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions.

The restructuring and bankruptcy alternatives set forth are available under Italian Bankruptcy Law to
companies which are (i) facing financial difficulties, (ii) in a state of temporary crisis or (iii) insolvent.

**_Out-of-Court Reorganization Plans (piani di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the_**
**_Italian Bankruptcy Law_**

Out-of-court restructuring agreements are based on restructuring plans (piani di risanamento) prepared by
companies in order to restructure their indebtedness and to ensure the recovery of their financial condition. An
independent expert appointed by the debtor has to verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the
truthfulness of the business data provided by the company.

The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable. Unlike in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement
proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans pursuant to Article 67,
Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement
proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that,
should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out for the
implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (i) are not subject to clawback action and
(ii) are exempted from certain potentially applicable criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor
publication in the companies’ register are needed (although publication in the companies’ register is possible
upon a debtor’s request and would allow for certain tax benefits) and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or
disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring
agreement.

**_Debt Restructuring Agreements with Creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to_**
**_Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law_**

Out-of-court agreements for the restructuring of indebtedness entered into with creditors representing at
least 60% of the outstanding company’s debts can be ratified by the court. An expert appointed by the debtor

299


-----

must assess the truthfulness of the debtor accounts and financial reports provided by the company and declare
that the agreement is feasible and, particularly, that it ensures that the debts of the nonparticipating creditors can
be fully paid within the following time frames: (i) 120 days from the date of ratification of the agreement by the
court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the nonparticipating creditors as at the date of the
sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (ii) 120 days from the date on
which the relevant debts fall due, in case of receivables which are not yet due and payable to the nonparticipating
creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only
a debtor who is insolvent or in a state of crisis (i.e., facing distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) can
initiate this process and request the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement
entered into with its creditors.

The agreement with creditors is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its
publication. Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or
continue any interim relief or enforcement actions over the assets of the debtor and cannot obtain any security
interest (unless agreed) in relation to pre-existing debts. Pursuant to the Law Decree No. 78 of May 31, 2010,
such moratorium can be requested, pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, by
the debtor from the court during negotiations with creditors (i.e. prior to the above-mentioned publication of the
agreement), subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions. The moratorium request must be published in the
companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the
completeness of the documentation, sets the date for a hearing (to be held within 30 days of the publication to
assess whether the conditions for granting the moratorium are in place and, if they are, orders that no interim
relief or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over
the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which the restructuring agreement has
to be filed. The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame,
an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed with the court, without prejudice
to the effect of the moratorium.

The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the
debt restructuring agreement. The agreement and the attached plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the
prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party and may
contain, refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring
agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the
agreement in the companies’ register. The court will, after having settled the oppositions (if any), validate or
reject the agreement by issuing a decree, which may be appealed within 15 days of its publication.

Pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court, pending the sanctioning
(omologazione) of the agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 1, or after the filing of the instance
pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6, or a petition for a concordato preventivo, also pursuant to Article 161,
paragraph 6, may authorize the debtor (i) to incur new “pre-deductible indebtedness,” provided that the expert
appointed by the debtor declares the aim of the new financial indebtedness results in a better satisfaction of the
creditors, and (ii) to pay debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, already payable and due, provided
that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of company’s activities and to ensure the
best satisfaction for all creditors.

**_Court Supervised Pre Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (“concordato preventivo”)_**

A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis, but has not been declared insolvent by the court,
has the option to seek an arrangement with its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall
indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of
bankruptcy proceedings. Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any
of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding
€0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenues (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate
amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in
excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo
(together with, inter alia, the proposed agreement and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the
composition proposal and the truthfulness of the debtor accounts and financial reports provided by the company).
The petition for concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the companies’ register. From the date
of such publication to the date on which the court definitively validates the concordato preventivo, all

300


-----

enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose claims arose before the publication of the petition
for the concordato preventivo) are stayed. During this time, all enforcement, precautionary actions and interim
measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. Pre existing creditors cannot obtain
security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date
on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the companies’ register are ineffective against
such pre existing creditors.

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring of debts
and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner (including through extraordinary transactions, such as the
granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds
convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities; (ii) the assignment of the assets of the
company to a third party which undertakes the obligation to satisfy the creditors in certain percentages; (iii) the
division of creditors into classes; and (iv) to a certain extent, different treatments for creditors belonging to
different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred
payment of certain taxes.

The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary
petition for a concordato preventivo (“domanda di preconcordato” o “concordato con riserva”) pursuant to
Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law introduced by the Law Decree No. 83 of June 22, 2012,
converted, with modifications, into Law No. 134 of August 7, 2012. The debtor company may file such petition
with the Court along with (i) its financial statements of the latest three financial years and, pursuant to the recent
Law Decree No. 69 of June 21, 2013, as converted into law No. 98 of August 9, 2013 (the “Law Decree
**69/2013”), (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the**
right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all the other documents requested by the law within a period
assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition (extendible
for further 60 days by Court decision, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension). Before the expiry
of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant
to Article 182 bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). Pursuant to the Law Decree 69/2013, the court, if it accepts
such preliminary petition, may appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the
company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities referred under Article 173 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g. concealment of part of assets, fraudulent omission to report one or more claims,
declaration of non-existent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), shall report it to the court, which,
upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo, and, upon request of one or
more creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, adjudicate the
company in bankruptcy.

The debtor company may not file such pre application where it had already done so in the previous two
years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed or the validation of a debt
restructuring agreement with creditors having occurred. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the
documentation referred above contains also the periodical information requirements (relating also to the financial
management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the composition
proposal and the relevant plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the
term established by the court. The debtor company shall file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial
position, which is published, the following day, in the companies’ register. Non-compliance with these
requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon
request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the
adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company
appear to be clearly inappropriate to the drafting of the composition proposal and the relevant plan, the court
may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the
filing of additional documents.

Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with
creditors, the distressed company may (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity and (ii) seek the court’s
authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its extraordinary activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising
from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company in the time frame above are “pre-deductible” claims
(crediti prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and
security interests granted are exempted from the clawback action provided under Article 67 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law. The plan attached to the composition proposal may provide for (i) the continuation of the
debtor company’s business as a going concern, or (ii) the transfer of the business to one or more companies
(concordato con continuità aziendale). The said plan may also provide for the sale of any assets which are no

301


-----

longer necessary to run the business. In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully
describe the costs and revenues which are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a
going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the
independent expert—in addition to assessing the feasibility of the agreement and the truthfulness of the debtor
accounts and financial reports—shall also certify that the continuation of the business is in the creditors’ interest.

The composition agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment
of certain taxes.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to
supervise the procedure and one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’ meeting.
During the implementation of the proposal, the company continues to be managed by its director/directors, but
he/they is/are supervised by the appointed judicial officers and the judge (who shall authorize all transactions that
exceed the ordinary course of business).

The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved by the majority (by
value of claims) of the creditors entitled to vote and, if creditors are divided in classes, by the majority of the
creditors included in the majority of the classes. Creditors who have not voted will be deemed to approve the
_concordato preventivo proposal if they fail to notify their objection via telegraph, fax, mail or e mail to such_
proposal within 20 days from the closure of the minutes of that creditors’ meeting. Secured creditors are not
entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the
_concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured_
assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the
part of their debt affected by the proposal. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is
filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a
dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless approve the concordato preventivo if it deems that
the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo
than would otherwise be the case.

After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the
dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order.

If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the
public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company
bankrupt.

**_Extraordinary Administration for Large Insolvent Companies (“amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi_**
**_imprese in stato di insolvenza”)_**

The extraordinary administration proceedings governed by Legislative Decree No. 270 of July 8, 1999
applies to very large insolvent companies and is supervised by the Ministry of the Economic Development
(“Ministero dello sviluppo economico”—the “Ministry”). The proceedings apply exclusively to companies able
to continue their business (also) during the insolvency proceedings and having (i) at least 200 employees in the
last financial year and (ii) debts of no less than 2/3 of both the net equity and the total revenues of the last
financial year.

The proceedings is split into two phases under the control of different authorities.

The first phase starts with the declaration by the Court (with the assistance of the Ministry of Economic
Development) of the insolvency status of the company upon company’s, public prosecutor’s, creditors’ request or
_ex officio. As a consequence of the declaration of the insolvency, the Court appoints one or three judicial_
receivers for the evaluation of the possibility of rescuing the business through one of the following alternative
paths:

(a) selling the company’s going concern (and the company’s remaining assets), on the basis of a business
plan lasting no more than one year (the “Sale Plan”); or

(b) restructuring the company’s debt on the basis of a restructuring plan lasting no more than two years
(the “Restructuring Plan”).

302


-----

Performing the extraordinary receivership proceedings through a Sale Plan can be considered similar to
liquidating the assets under a bankruptcy proceedings, whereas a Restructuring Plan is performed mainly through
composition with creditors proceedings, which are very similar to the Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with
Creditors and the Post-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors.

Within thirty days from the filing of the judicial receivers report, the court is requested to:

(i) admit the company to the extraordinary receivership proceedings, as far as the court believes it is
possible to rescue the company’s business through a Sale Plan or a Restructuring Plan; or, conversely,

(ii) adjudicate the insolvent company in bankruptcy.

With the admission referred under (i) above starts the second phase of the extraordinary receivership. The
second phase is managed by one or three extraordinary receivers (commissari straordinari) (the “Commissioner/
**s”) who are appointed and supervised by the Ministry of Economic Development. A surveillance committee is**
appointed by the Minister of the Economic Development.

The Commissioner/s is/are requested to draft and file the Sale Plan or the Restructuring Plan (jointly, the
“Plans”) with the Ministry of Economic Development within the following 60 days. Such term could be
extended for a further 60 day period. The Plans are subject to the approval of the Ministry of Economic
Development and, afterwards, must be implemented by the Commissioner/s under the Ministry’s supervision.

The main effects of the extraordinary receivership proceedings can be summarized as follows:

(i) the outstanding claims vis-à-vis the company are frozen as of the date of the declaration of the
insolvency status of the company and shall be paid in accordance with the statutory priorities provided
by the law (as would occur in a bankruptcy proceedings);

(ii) individual creditors (including secured creditors) enforcement actions are barred but creditors secured
by pledge may be authorized by the Court to sell the pledged assets;

(iii) the company is managed by the Commissioner/s and continues to carry on its ordinary business
activities; and

(iv) the agreements entered into by the insolvent company remain effective and may not be terminated by
the counterparties on the basis of the default of the insolvent company. Conversely, the Commissioner/
s is/are entitled, at its/their discretion, to terminate any agreement already executed by the insolvent
company, unless the obligations arising from such agreement have already been fulfilled by one of the
parties thereto.

If during the one-year period (in case of Sale Plan) or the two-year period (in case of Restructuring Plan) the
Commissioner/s or the court deems that the Plans are no longer feasible, the court adjudicates the company in
bankruptcy.

Unlike the other insolvency proceedings, the Legislative Decree No. 270 of July 8, 1999 provides that all
insolvent business entities (also other than companies) controlled by, controlling, or under the common control
of, the company first admitted to extraordinary receivership, are admitted to extraordinary receivership, even if
not eligible, rather than declared bankrupt, provided that:

(a) such other “group” entities may be reorganized on a “stand alone” basis; or

(b) the objectives of the selected plan may be better pursued by a common management of the “group”
insolvency.

The procedures remain separate, but the extraordinary receiver(s) is the same.

For the sake of completeness, please note that, further to the latest financial crisis involving major Italian
groups, the Legislative Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003 (converted, with modifications, into Law No. 39
of February 18, 2004) introduced a new extraordinary receivership proceedings (the so called “Marzano
**Extraordinary Receivership Proceedings”) which applies to very large insolvent companies having,**
individually or as a group established for at least one year:

(i) no less than 500 employees in the last financial year; and

(ii) debts, including those arising from the issuance of guarantees, in an aggregate amount of at least EUR
300 million.

303


-----

The Marzano Extraordinary Receivership Proceedings: (i) allow quicker admission of the insolvent
company to the extraordinary receivership proceedings and (ii) is more subject to the supervision of the Ministry
than to the control of the court.

**_Bankruptcy (fallimento)_**

A request to declare a debtor company bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings for the judicial
liquidation of the debtor company’s assets (fallimento) can be filed by the debtor company itself, by any of its
creditors and, in certain cases, by the public prosecutor. The bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy
court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if
any of the following thresholds are met (i.e., the company has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate
amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, or gross revenues (ricavi lordi) in an
aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years or total indebtedness in
excess of €0.5 million). On the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings:

    - subject to certain exceptions, creditors are prevented from individually taking any legal actions against
the debtor and no individual payments of credit are allowed. Ally credits are considered overdue and
accrual of interests on the creditors’ claims is suspended. Creditors must file their claims against the
debtor by submitting a proof of claim before the competent bankruptcy court within the term assigned
to them, and the designated judge (giudice delegato) may decide whether to admit the said claims into
the bankruptcy liabilities. Under certain circumstances secured creditors may enforce against the
secured property as soon as their claims are admitted into bankruptcy liabilities as preferred claims.
Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interests and expenses.
Any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s
other unsecured debt. The secured creditor may sell the secured asset only after it has obtained
authorization from the designated judge (giudice delegato) that, after hearing the bankruptcy receiver
(curatore fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee (comitato dei creditori), decides whether to
authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing, terms and conditions;

    - the administration of the debtor company and the management of its assets pass from the debtor
company to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare);

    - any act of the debtor company done after the declaration of bankruptcy (including payments) is
ineffective against the creditors;

    - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage
to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to
creditors; and

    - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy
declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general
rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts where some or
all of the obligations have not been performed by each of the parties, certain contracts are subject to
specific rules expressly provided for by the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court appointed bankruptcy receiver, a
designated judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative
of any one of the creditors, but is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor for the satisfaction of
the creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority.
The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets
include real property. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a priority of payment to certain preferential
creditors, including employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such priority of payment
is provided under mandatory provisions of Italian law (and, as a consequence, it is untested and it is unlikely that
priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be
recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by
applicable law).

**_Post-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (“concordato fallimentare”)_**

A bankruptcy proceeding can terminate prior to the liquidation of all its assets ant the distribution of the
relevant proceeds among the creditor through a post-bankruptcy composition with creditors. The relevant
proposal can be filed, by one or more creditors or third parties, from the declaration of bankruptcy. The debtor or
its subsidiaries are only permitted to file such proposal after one year following such declaration, and no later

304


-----

than two years following the decree giving effectiveness to the bankruptcy liabilities (stato passivo). Secured
creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive
their security or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market
value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote
only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal.

The proposal may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatment
among the classes), the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner.

The concordato fallimentare proposal must be submitted to the bankruptcy receiver and to the creditors’
committee and—should the proposal split the creditors in different classes—it must also be reviewed by the
bankruptcy court. Then, the concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the majority of the creditors
admitted to vote and if creditors are divided in different classes, by the majority of the creditors included in the
majority of the classes. Final court ratification is also required.

**_Statutory Priorities_**

The statutory priority given to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from priorities
established in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Neither the debtor nor
the court can deviate from the rules of statutory priority by proposing their own priorities of claims or by
subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles (as a consequence it must be
noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements may
not be enforceable against an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities
provided by law). The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds
derived from the sale of the entire bankruptcy assets of part thereof, or from a single asset. Article 111 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following
order: (i) for payments of “pre deductible” claims (crediti prededucibili) (i.e., claims defined as “pre-deductible”
claims by a specific provision of law or arose in or with a view to the insolvency proceedings, such as costs
related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and
(iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims (creditori chirografari). Under Italian law, the highest
priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors including, inter
_alia, a claim whose priority is legally acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing, mentioned above),_
the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security authorities, and claims for employee wages. The
remaining priority claims are those of “privileged” creditors (creditori privilegiati) having a priority in payment
in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgagees (creditori ipotecari) and pledgees
(creditori prignoratizi).

Privileged claims are paid out of the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interest and expenses. Any
outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured
debt.

**_Certain Limitations on Enforcement_**

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and
security interests given by it during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”) could be subject to
potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or
clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law. For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences
of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Italian Insolvency Laws” above.

If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any
amounts received must be refunded to the receiver. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or
guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not
be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can
be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a
guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to revoke or
declare ineffective pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (azione revocatoria ordinaria) the said
guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of
credit.

305


-----

An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to
the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings:

    - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor,
or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently
designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and

    - that, in the case of non gratuitous act, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the
act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the
fraudulent design.

Furthermore, under fraudulent conveyance and other provisions of Italian law, a court could void or
invalidate all or a portion of the obligations of a guarantor under the relevant guarantee and, if payment had
already been made under that guarantee, require the recipients of that payment to return the payment to the
relevant guarantor, if the court found that, inter alia:

(i) the relevant guarantor gave such guarantee with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its current or
future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or when the beneficiary of the
guarantee was aware that the relevant guarantor was insolvent when it gave the relevant guarantee;

(ii) the relevant guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for its guarantee
or the relevant guarantor was insolvent at the time the guarantee was given;

(iii) the relevant guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant guarantor or not to be in
the best interest or for the corporate benefit of the relevant guarantor; or

(iv) the guarantor giving such guarantee was aware, or should have been aware, that the transaction was to
the detriment of the creditors.

If a court decided either that a guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such guarantee, or held it
unenforceable for any other reason, the beneficiary of the guarantee may cease to have any claim with respect to
the relevant guarantor. The same would also apply to any security interest.

In any case, it should be noted that: (i) under article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, all transactions for no
consideration, depending on certain circumstances, are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the
bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration; and (ii) under article 65 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are
ineffective vis-à-vis creditors (and could therefore be clawed back), if performed by the bankrupt entity in the
two-year period prior to the declaration of insolvency.

Payments or grants of securities and/or other transactions are exempted from claw back or avoidance
provisions when made in accordance with (a) out-of-court restructuring plans pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph
3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, (b) agreements to restructure indebtedness (“accordi di ristrutturazione dei
_debiti”) under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or (c) court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition_
with creditors (“concordato preventivo”), including concordato con continuità aziendale and concordato con
_riserva._

In addition, it should be noted that the Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 contains
conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to
insolvency proceedings within the E.U.

**_Corporate Benefit and Financial Assistance Issues under Italian Law_**

Under Italian law, the entry into of a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the granting
of a guarantee) by a company must be permitted by the applicable laws and by its by laws (statuto sociale) and is
subject to compliance with the rules on corporate benefit and corporate authorization. If a security interest or a
guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition, financial assistance issues may also be triggered.

_Corporate Benefit_

An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee) must
receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for it. The concept of a real and adequate benefit is not
specifically defined in the applicable legislation and is determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis.

306


-----

As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand alone basis,
although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such
company belongs may also be taken into consideration.

As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate corporate benefit could render the transaction (including
granting a security interest or a guarantee) ultra vires and potentially affected by conflict of interest and the
related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges
and annulment. Civil liabilities also may be imposed on the directors of the company if it is assessed that they did
not act in the interest of it and that the acts they carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the
company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also lead to
civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over the Italian grantor or having
knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the transaction (including the
security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be declared null and void if the lack of
corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally
against the interest of the company.

The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to upstream/crossstream/downstream security
interest or guarantees granted by Italian companies.

In relation to security interests or guarantees, while corporate benefit for a downstream security or guarantee
(i.e., a security or a guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the
relevant grantor) can usually be easily proved, it is more complex to prove the existence of a real and adequate
benefit for an upstream or cross stream security or guarantee (i.e., a security interest or a guarantee granted to
secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) to be
granted by an entity organized under the laws of Italy. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an Italian
grantor of security or guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. In
particular, in case of upstream and cross stream security interests or guarantees for the financial obligations of
group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through
intercompany loans from other members of that group.

_Financial Assistance_

Save for specific exceptions, it is unlawful under Italian laws for a company to give financial assistance
(whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or subscription by a
third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian
company, and any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void.
Financial assistance to refinance indebtedness incurred by a company to purchase or subscribe for its own shares
or quotes or those of its direct or indirect parent company might also be considered as falling within the scope of
Italian financial assistance provisions.

More specifically, Italian rules on financial assistance, provided under articles 2358 and 2474 of the Italian
Civil Code, prohibit the grant by the Guarantors organized in Italy (the “Italian Guarantors”) of guarantees in
respect of indebtedness incurred for the acquisition (or the refinancing of the acquisition) of such Guarantors’
own shares or quotas, or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls such Guarantors. In light of these
rules, the liability of each Italian Guarantor under its guarantee of the Notes is expressly limited to an amount
corresponding to the principal amount of the financial indebtedness of the relevant Italian Guarantor to be repaid
through the proceeds of the Notes. This “virtual tranching” structure (i.e., whereby the relevant portion of the
proceeds of the Notes which do not constitute “acquisition debt” and, therefore, do not fall within the prohibition
under Italian financial assistance rules, are identified, but not actually separated into a separate tranche of
financial indebtedness) is untested in Italian courts. Therefore, it may be deemed insufficient for clearly
distinguishing and separating the non-“acquisition debt” portion of the proceeds of the Notes distributed to
Italian Guarantors, and it may result in the Guarantees violating the provisions of articles 2358 and 2474 of the
Italian Civil Code. If an Italian court determined that such a violation had occurred, it would result in the
guarantees by the Italian Guarantors being null and void, which would mean that holders of the Notes would
have no recourse to the assets of the Italian Guarantors and no claim against the Italian Guarantors in an
insolvency or other scenario.

Subject to the foregoing, the Guarantees by the Italian Guarantors (Wittur Italia Holding s.r.l. and Wittur
S.p.A.) are expected to be limited to €5.0 million and €1.0 million, respectively (based on a Completion Date of
March 31, 2015). The limitation of the Italian Guarantees will be calculated as a percentage of the intercompany
proceeds loans used to refinance existing indebtedness of our Italian subsidiaries and could be higher or lower,
depending on the amount of outstanding local debt on the actual Completion Date. However, we cannot provide
any assurances that holders of the Notes will be able to recover even these amounts under such Guarantees, as

307


-----

payment under each Guarantee is contractually subordinated to all the senior indebtedness of such Guarantor,
including such Guarantor’s obligations under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations.

**Spain**

One of the Guarantors, Wittur Elevator Components, S.A.U. (the “Spanish Guarantor”), is incorporated
under the laws of Spain. In the event of insolvency, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Spain. The
insolvency laws of Spain may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States,
the United Kingdom or other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Spain. In the event that we, or
any of our subsidiaries, experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to know with certainty in which
jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such
proceedings.

Pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that has jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in
relation to a company is the court of the member state (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has
its “centre of main interest” as the term is used in article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Where a
company conducts business in more than one member state of the European Union, the jurisdiction of the
relevant courts may be limited if the company’s “centre of main interests” is found to be in a member state other
than its place of incorporation. There are a number of factors that are taken into account to ascertain the centre of
main interests, which should correspond to the place where the company conducts the administration of its
interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties. The point at which this issue will be
determined is at the time when the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. The determination of where the
Issuer or any of the Guarantors has its “centre of main interests” would be a question of fact on which the courts
of the different European Union member states may have differing and even conflicting views. It should also be
noted that a limited number of final decisions have been taken in cases that have been brought before the
European Court of Justice in relation to questions of interpretation or the effects of the EU Insolvency Regulation
throughout the European Union. Furthermore, “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change
from time to time.

The Law 22/2003, of July 9, on Insolvency (Ley 22/2003, de 9 de julio, Concursal, ), as amended from time
to time (the “Spanish Insolvency Law”) regulates court insolvency proceedings in Spain. Insolvency
proceedings in Spain, which are known as “concurso de acreedores”, are applicable to all persons and entities,
except public entities.

The debtor may file for insolvency (or file with the insolvency court a communication under 5 Bis of
Spanish Insolvency Law informing that it has commenced negotiations with its creditors to agree a refinancing
agreement or an advanced proposal of settlement agreement (convenio), to obtain an additional period of three
months to negotiate with its creditors[5]) as a protective measure in order to avoid the attachment of its assets or
suspension of certain enforcement actions that could be taken by its creditors.

These proceedings may lead either to a composition agreement (convenio de acreedores) with creditors
(which may include the restructuring of the business of the debtor) or to the liquidation of the assets of the
debtor.

Insolvency is considered voluntary (concurso voluntario) if filed by the debtor. A debtor (and, in the case of
a company, its directors (órgano de administración)) is required to apply for insolvency proceedings when it is
not regularly able to meet its current payment obligations on a general basis (insolvencia actual). The debtor is
also entitled to apply for such insolvency proceedings when it expects that it will shortly be unable to meet its
current payment obligations on a general basis (insolvency inminente). The debtor is obliged to file a petition for
insolvency within two months after it becomes aware, or should have become aware, of its state of insolvency. It
is presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its insolvency, unless otherwise proved, if any of the
circumstances that qualify as the basis for a petition for mandatory insolvency occur.

Insolvency is considered mandatory (concurso necesario) if filed by other than the debtor, such as creditors
and other interested third parties. Under Spanish Insolvency Law, creditors may also apply for a debtor’s
insolvency if they can prove to the court, inter alia: (i) a generalized default on payments of its current
obligations when due by the debtor; (ii) a seizure of assets affecting or comprising the generality of the debtor’s
assets; (iii) a misplacement, “fire sale” or ruinous liquidation of the debtor’s assets; or (iv) a generalized default
on certain tax, social security and employment obligations during the applicable statutory period (three months
prior to the filing of the relevant insolvency request).

5 There is one month to file for insolvency after the three-month negotiation period has elapsed.

308


-----

Upon a filing for insolvency proceedings, the court issues an insolvency order containing an express request
for the creditors of the insolvent debtor to declare all debts owed to them by the debtor, providing original
documentation to justify such debts, within a period of one month after the announcement of the insolvency
declaration in the Spanish Official Gazette (Boletín Oficial del Estado). Based on the documentation provided by
the creditors and documentation held by the debtor, insolvency administrator draws up a list of acknowledged
creditors (together with a list of assets of the insolvent company) and classifies them according to the categories
established under the law:

    - debts benefiting from special privileges, representing security interests on certain assets (in essence, in
_rem sureties). The amount of debt benefiting from special privileges is limited to the collateral assets as_
valued according to certain criteria described in the Spanish Insolvency Law. The rest (deficiency
claim) will have the ranking that would have corresponded to it if had not been secured by an in rem
security. The value of the in rem security will be that resulting from deducting from nine-tenths of the
fair value (as defined in the Spanish Insolvency Law) of the asset or right over which the security is
granted, any outstanding debts enjoying a preferential security over the same asset. The value cannot be
less than zero or greater than the value of the privileged claim or the value of the maximum mortgage
or pledge liability which might have been agreed. Privileged creditors can be subject to the
composition agreement in the event that a special majority is achieved. Further, unless subject to Royal
Decree-law 5/2005, the enforcement of the security interests securing these credits is subject to certain
restrictions derived from a waiting period that may last up to one year unless the relevant charged asset
is not necessary for the debtor’s professional or business activity. In the event of liquidation, they are
the first to collect payment against the assets on which their debt is secured;

    - debts benefiting from general privileges, including, among others, labour, tort and public debts.
General privileges for public debt (other than debt relating to tax withholdings and certain social
security obligations, which are recognized in full) are recognized for one-half of the amount of the
debt. General privileges are also recognized for half of the amount of debt held by the first creditor to
apply for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor (should that application be successful). Despite the
transitory regime of the Spanish Insolvency Act which currently applies (discussed below), as a general
principle new monies granted under a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the
requirements set forth in Article 71.bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Law
in the amount not admitted as a debt against the insolvency estate (“crédito contra la masa”) will also
be recognized as credits with general privilege. Creditors whose debt benefits from general privileges
can be affected by the composition agreement in the event that a special majority is achieved. In the
event of liquidation, they collect payment after the full payment of the claims against the insolvency
estate (créditos contra la masa) out of the assets of the debtor which are not subject to security;

    - ordinary debts (non-subordinated and non-privileged creditors). Creditors of ordinary debt will be paid
after claims benefiting from general privileges have been completely paid up and on a pro rata basis
vis-à-vis each other and together with the amount (deficiency claim) not covered by the proceeds
obtained in the foreclosure of the assets securing the special privileged credits. If the debtor achieves a
composition agreement, the ordinary credits will be affected; and

    - subordinated debts (classified as such by virtue of the underlying credit agreement or pursuant to law).
Subordinated debts include, among others, debts held by parties in special relationships with the debtor
(insiders), such as, in the case of a legal entity, debts held by the directors (either appointed directors or
_de facto directors (administradores de hecho o de derecho)), general attorneys (apoderados generales)_
of the debtor, group companies, their common shareholders, and any direct or indirect shareholders
holding more than 5% (for companies which have issued securities listed on an official secondary
market) or 10% (for companies which have not issued securities listed in an official secondary market)
of the debtor’s share capital. However, creditors who have directly or indirectly capitalized their credit
rights pursuant to a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth
in Article 71.bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Law shall not be considered
as being in a special relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor resulting from
such refinancing arrangement. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the assignees of debt
formerly owned by any of the abovementioned persons which acquired such debt within the two year
period the insolvency declaration are presumed to be persons specially related to the insolvent debtor
and, therefore, their claim shall be subordinated. Subordinated creditors are not entitled to vote on the
composition agreement (convenio) and, although they are bound by it, in practice usually have very
limited chances of collection, as a result of the ranking established by law.

For the sake of completeness, we should also refer to claims against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la
_masa). Claims against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la masa) are not considered part of the debtor’s_

309


-----

general debt insolvency claims (créditos concursales) and are payable when due according to their own terms
(and, therefore, apart from privileged claims are paid before other debts under insolvency proceedings). Claims
against the insolvency estate include, among others, (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll, (ii) costs and
expenses of the insolvency proceedings, (iii) certain amounts arising from services provided by to the insolvent
debtor under reciprocal contracts and outstanding obligations that remain in force after insolvency proceedings
are declared and deriving from obligations to return and indemnify in cases of voluntary termination or breach by
the insolvent debtor, (iv) those amounts that derive from the exercise of a claw-back action within the insolvency
proceedings of acts performed by the insolvent debtor and correspond to a refund of consideration received by it
(except in cases of bad faith), (v) certain amounts arising from obligations created by law or from the noncontractual liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of insolvency and until its conclusion, (vi) certain
debts incurred by the debtor following the declaration of insolvency; (vii) in case of liquidation, the credit rights
granted to the debtor under a composition agreement in accordance with article 100.5 of the Spanish Insolvency
Law, and (viii) 100% of the new funds lent under a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the
requirements set forth in article 71.bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Law, provided
that it has been entered into after March 9, 2014; and (ix) 100% of the new funds lent by persons being in a
special relationship with the debtor in the context of a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with
the requirements set forth in article 71.bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Law,
provided that such arrangement has been entered into after March 9, 2014 and provided further that such new
funds do not result from a share capital increase. As from March 10, 2016 only 50% of the new funds referred to
in subsection (viii) will be considered as claims against the insolvency estate, and funds referred to in subsection
(ix) will no longer be considered as claims against the insolvency estate.

As a general rule, the debtor in a voluntary insolvency retains its management power, but is subject to the
intervention of the insolvency administrator (administrador concursal) (receiver), who is appointed by the court.
In the case of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor’s management will be replaced by the
insolvency trustee. However, the court has the power to modify this general regime subject to the specific
circumstances of the case.

A declaration of insolvency does not affect agreements with reciprocal obligations pending performance by
either the insolvent party or the counterparty (executory contracts), which remain in full force and effect, and the
obligations of the insolvent debtor will be fulfilled against the insolvent estate. The court can nonetheless
terminate any such contracts at the request of the insolvency trustee, the company itself or the non-debtor when
such termination is in the interest of the insolvency estate or if there has been a breach of such contract. The
termination of such contracts may result in the insolvent debtor having to return or indemnify its counterpart,
being this claim classified as a claim against the insolvency estate.

Although the creditors may be able to accelerate the maturity of claims based only on the declaration of
insolvency (declaración de concurso) if so agreed, they cannot terminate executory contracts (except if expressly
permitted by specific laws, i.e. agency law). Any provision to the contrary will be null and void.

Additionally, the declaration of insolvency determines that interest accrual is suspended, except credit rights
secured with an in rem right, in which case interest accrues up to the value of the security, and except for any
wage credits in favor of employees, which will accrue the legal interest set forth in the corresponding Law of the
State Budget (Ley de Presupuestos del Estado).

Pursuant to article 55 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law, enforcement actions in process shall be
suspended from the date of the declaration of the insolvency proceedings; notwithstanding the dealing of the
respective claims within the insolvency proceedings.

Additionally, once the insolvency proceedings are declared, singular, judicial or extrajudicial enforcements
may not be initiated against the debtor, nor may administrative or tax demands for payment to be collected
coercively against the assets of the debtor be continued (although certain exceptions apply).

Notwithstanding the foregoing and pursuant to articles 55 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law referred to
above, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and creditors, the law extends the jurisdiction of the court
dealing with insolvency proceedings, which is, then, legally authorized to handle any enforcement proceedings or
interim measures (medidas cautelares) affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor or
administrative law).

Pursuant to article 56 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, creditors with a security in rem against the insolvent
debtor’s assets which are necessary for his professional or business activity, may not enforce the security until a
composition agreement is reached whose content does not affect exercise of that right, or until one year elapses
from declaring the insolvency proceedings open without the winding-up having commenced. This does not apply
if the security interest is subject to Royal Decree-law 5/2005.

310


-----

Furthermore, the enforcement proceedings of security in rem already commenced shall be suspended from
the date of the declaration of the insolvency proceedings in the same terms set forth in article 55 of the Spanish
Insolvency Law.

Under the Spanish Insolvency Law, there is no automatic “claw-back date”, meaning there are no prior
transactions that automatically become void as a result of the initiation of insolvency proceedings. Rather,
insolvency administrators (or creditors if the insolvency administrator rejects to do so) may only challenge
transactions that could be deemed as having “damaged” the insolvency estate, provided that such transactions
have taken place within two years prior to the declaration of insolvency (transactions taking place earlier than
two years before the insolvency proceedings has been declared may be rescinded subject to ordinary Spanish
Civil Code based actions).

Those transactions that are classified as “ordinary” transactions in the course of the business of the debtor
are not subject to challenge. The Spanish Insolvency Law does not define the meaning of “patrimonial damage.”
“Damage” does not refer to the intention of the parties but to the consequences of a given transaction on the
debtor’s interest which results on the damage to the insolvent debtor’s estate (absence of reasonable equivalent
value) or the prejudice to the equality of the treatment among creditors which drives insolvency proceedings (par
_condition creditorum). In any case, the Spanish Insolvency Law refers to certain transactions that are deemed by_
operation of law as damaging to the company’s estate: damage exists (as a non-rebuttable presumption), among
others, in case of donations and early payment of non-secured obligations maturing after the insolvency
declaration; and damage is deemed to exist (as a rebuttable presumption), among others, where a transaction is
entered into with a party having a special relationship with the debtor, early payment of secured obligations
maturing after insolvency declaration, and when rights in rem have been created in order to protect already
existing (non-secured) obligations. In cases in which damage is not presumed, proof of damage is required.

If the claw-back action is successful, reciprocal restitution of the consideration will be ordered, along with
any benefit and interest accrued (as long as the avoided agreement is an executory contract). When it is no longer
possible to return the item received, the cash equivalent of its value must be delivered. The obligation arising
from the action for restoration is considered a credit against the insolvency estate (provided that the agreement is
an executory contract), unless the third party is held to have acted in bad faith, in which case the credit due to the
restoration will be considered as subordinate.

Specific types of refinancing agreements are protected from claw-back actions, including the guarantees and
security interest granted in execution of such agreements. Article 71 bis and 4th Additional Provision of the
Spanish Insolvency Law provides the requirements for such refinancing agreement to be protected from clawback.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance Laws_**

Under Spanish law, in addition to the insolvency claw-back action, the insolvency administrator and any
creditor may bring an action to rescind a contract or agreement (acción rescisoria pauliana) against the debtor
and the third party which is a party to such contract or agreement, provided that the same is performed or entered
into fraudulently and the creditor cannot obtain payment of the amounts owed in any other way. Although case
law is not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted that the following requirements must be met in order for a
creditor to bring such action:

    - the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took place after
such debt was created;

    - the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third party;

    - such act was fraudulent;

    - there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages
suffered; and

    - debtor’s insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the debtor’s
estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim.

The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements under
Spanish law for the action to rescind to succeed. Pursuant to Article 1,297 of the Spanish Civil Code:
(i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration, and (ii) transfers for
consideration carried out by parties who have been held liable by a court (sentencia condenatoria) or whose
assets have been subject to a writ of attachment (mandamiento de embargo) will be considered fraudulent. The
presumption referred to in (i) above is a iuris et de iure presumption (i.e. it cannot be rebutted by evidence),
unlike the presumption indicated in (ii) above, which is a iuris tantum presumption (i.e. it is a rebuttable
presumption).

311


-----

If the rescission action were to be upheld, the third party would be liable to return to the debtor the
consideration received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor. Following that, the
creditor would need to carry out the actions necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor. If the
consideration received by the third party under the contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the third party must
indemnify the creditor for such damages.

**_Enforcement of Civil Liabilities—Spain_**

A final and conclusive judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors outside of Spain (and,
in particular, duly rendered by certain U.S. Courts or any other appellate court in the United States), but other
than in a country bound by the provisions of EU Regulation number 1215/2012 of the Council on jurisdiction and
enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, would be recognized and enforced by the courts of
Spain (unless such judgment contravenes principles of Spanish public policy and/or there is a material
contradiction or incompatibility with a judgment rendered or judicial proceedings outstanding in Spain) pursuant
to the following regimes:

    - According to the provisions of any applicable treaty (there being none currently in existence between
Spain and the United States for these purposes).

    - In the absence of any such treaty, if it could be proven that the jurisdiction in which the foreign
judgment was rendered recognizes Spanish judgments on a reciprocal basis (positive reciprocity) and
provided that certain minimum conditions are met (among others, that the matter is not exclusively
subject to Spanish jurisdiction, does not infringe public policy and does not contradict a previous
Spanish judgment). If it could be proven (usually by the defendant) that the foreign jurisdiction in
which the judgment was obtained does not recognize judgments issued by Spanish courts, then the
Spanish courts would not recognize such foreign judgment in Spain (negative reciprocity).

    - In the absence of any such treaty and where reciprocity has not been evidenced (and, according to
certain court precedents, even if positive reciprocity has been evidenced), the judgment would be
enforced in Spain through the enforcement proceeding (exequatur) if it satisfies all of the following
requirements in compliance with article 954 of the Royal Decree, of February 3, 1881, regarding the
Civil Procedure (Real Decreto de 3 de febrero de 1881, de promulgación de la Ley de Enjuiciamiento
_Civil) (the “Spanish Civil Procedure Law”) as interpreted by case law:_

       - the judgment is rendered as a result of an action in personam as opposed to an action in rem;

       - the judgment is not contrary to Spanish public policy;

       - the documentation prepared for the purposes of requesting the enforcement (carta ejecutoria)
meets all the legal requirements under the law of the United States in order to be considered an
authentic judgment and it also meets all requirements under the laws of Spain to be admitted (a
copy of the judgment is provided that is literal, authentic, sworn-translated into Spanish and
apostilled);

       - there is no pending proceeding between the same parties and in relation to the same issues in
Spain;

       - there is no judgment rendered between the same parties and for the same cause of action in Spain
or in another country, provided that in this latter case the judgment has been recognized in Spain;

       - where rendering the judgment, the courts rendering it did not infringe an exclusive ground of
jurisdiction provided for in Spanish law or based their jurisdiction on exorbitant grounds and the
choice of court is not fraudulent;

       - the rights of defense of the defendant were protected where rendering the judgment, including, but
not limited to, a proper service of process carried out with sufficient time for the defendant to
prepare its defense;

       - the legal action has to be taken with acknowledgment and appearance of the defendant in the
proceeding unless the defendant is considered as a strategic or willful default defendant
(demandado en rebeldía estratégica o voluntaria) in accordance with the relevant case law of the
Spanish Supreme Court (Tribunal Supremo) (e.g., decisions dated March 14 and May 17, 2007);
and

       - the obligation that the petitioner tries to execute has to be lawful in Spain.

312


-----

The United States and Spain are not party to any treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, any party
wishing to have a U.S. ruling recognized or enforced in Spain, which would not directly be recognized or
enforced in Spain, must file an application seeking declaration of enforceability of the U.S. resolution
(exequatur) with the relevant Spanish Judge of First Instance (Juzgado de Primera Instancia) or Commercial
Court (Juzgado de lo Mercantil) for which purpose the abovementioned requirements must be met.

The Spanish courts may express any such order in a currency other than euro in respect of the amount due
and payable by the Issuer or a Guarantor, but in case of enforcement in Spain, the court costs and interest will be
paid in euros.

Any judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors in any country bound by the provisions
of EU Regulation number 1215/2012 of the Council on jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments in civil and
commercial matters would be recognized and enforced in accordance with the terms set forth thereby.

The enforcement of any judgments in Spain entails, among others, the following actions and costs:
(a) documents in a language other than Spanish must be accompanied by a sworn translation into Spanish
(translator’s fees will be payable); (b) certain professional fees are required for the verification of the legal
authority of a party litigating in Spain, if needed; (c) certain court fees must be paid, and (d) the procedural acts
of a party litigating in Spain must be directed by an attorney-at-law and the party must be represented by a court
agent (procurador). In addition, Spanish civil proceedings rules cannot be amended by agreement of the parties
and will therefore prevail notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Notes.

**Sweden**

**_Insolvency Proceedings under Swedish Law_**

Under Swedish law, a debtor company may be subject to one of two types of insolvency proceedings,
bankruptcy pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act (1987:672), as amended (the “Swedish Bankruptcy Act”),
and reorganization pursuant to the Swedish Company Reorganization Act (1996:764), as amended (the “Swedish
**Reorganization Act”).**

In addition, any other party resident in the EU may be subject to Swedish law insolvency proceedings if it
has, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, its centre of main interest in Sweden. With regard to the parties
incorporated under the laws of Sweden any insolvency proceedings applicable to such party including any and all
of its assets (in Sweden and abroad) will, as a starting point and by virtue of Article 4 of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, be governed by Swedish insolvency law (lex fori concursus).

The insolvency laws of Sweden may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other
jurisdictions, including, inter alia, the priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as
security interests and the duration of the insolvency proceedings. Hence, Swedish law may limit the ability of
creditors to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under the laws of
other jurisdictions. The following sections include a brief and limited description of certain aspects of the
insolvency laws of Sweden.

**_Bankruptcy pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act_**

_General_

Pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act, if a company is unable to rightfully pay its debts as they fall due
and such inability is not merely temporary, it is deemed insolvent and can be declared bankrupt following a
bankruptcy petition filed with the court by the debtor or by a creditor of the debtor.

When declared bankrupt, a receiver in bankruptcy (konkursförvaltare) is appointed by the court and will
work in the interest of all creditors with the objective of realizing the debtor’s assets and distributing the proceeds
among the creditors. The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings is to wind up the company in such a way that the
company’s creditors receive as high a proportion of their claims as possible. The receiver in bankruptcy is
required to safeguard the assets and can decide to continue the business or to close it down, depending on what is
deemed preferable for all the creditors. In general, the receiver in bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the
debtor as soon as possible and to distribute the proceeds in accordance with statutory rules. In the interim, the
receiver will take over the management and control of the company and the company’s directors and/or
managing director will no longer be entitled to represent the company or dispose of the company’s assets. All
creditors (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the bankruptcy estate) wishing to assert claims
against the company that is declared bankrupt need to participate in the bankruptcy proceedings.

313


-----

_Effect of Bankruptcy on the Bankruptcy Debtor’s Contracts_

The declaration of bankruptcy does not automatically terminate existing contracts; instead, the receiver may,
in relation to certain contracts, in its discretion choose to have the bankruptcy estate itself become party to any
such existing contracts. A clause in such a contract which provides that the contract is terminated by reason of a
bankruptcy petition or similar proceeding is likely to be deemed unenforceable. If the estate enters into such a
contract and performance by the counterparty is due, the counterparty may generally demand that the estate
perform its obligations as well or, if a grace period has been granted, request that the estate, without unreasonable
delay, provides acceptable security for its performance. If performance by the counterparty is not due, the
counterparty may request security where this is necessary in order to protect the counterparty against loss. If the
estate does not enter into the contract within a reasonable time after the counterparty’s demand or if it does not
comply with the counterparty’s request to provide security, the counterparty may terminate the contract.

_Order of Priorities_

When distributing the proceeds, the receiver must follow the mandatory provisions of the Swedish Rights of
Priority Act (1970:979), as amended (the “Swedish Rights of Priority Act”), which states the order in which
creditors have a right to be paid. As a general principle, in bankruptcy proceedings competing claims have equal
right to payment, in relation to the size of the amount claimed, from the debtor’s assets. However, preferential or
secured creditors, where such preference follows by law, have the benefit of payment before other creditors.
There are two types of preferential rights: specific and general preferential rights. Specific preferential rights are
vested in certain specific property (see below) and give the creditor right to payment out of such property. Such
preferential and secured creditors may also under certain circumstances enforce the security in accordance with
the Swedish Enforcement Act (1981:774), or if the security is provided by way of a pledge on movable assets
(handpanträtt), enforcement through private enforcement procedures as permitted pursuant to the Swedish
Bankruptcy Act. General preferential rights cover all property belonging to the insolvent company’s estate in
bankruptcy, which is not covered by specific preferential rights. Claims that do not carry any of the
abovementioned preferential rights or exceed the value of the security provided for such claim (to the extent of
such excess), are non-preferential and are of equal standing as against each other.

**_Limitations on Enforceability due to the Swedish Reorganization Act_**

_General_

The Swedish Reorganization Act provides companies facing economic difficulty with an opportunity to
resolve these difficulties without being declared bankrupt. A petition for company reorganization may be
presented by the debtor or a creditor of the debtor. If a creditor petitions for company reorganization, the debtor’s
consent to the reorganization is required. Prerequisites for an approval of a petition for company reorganization is
that it can be assumed that the debtor is unable to pay its due debts or such inability will occur shortly and there
is a possibility that the reorganization will be successful in resolving the company’s financial difficulties.
Corporate reorganization proceedings may as a main rule continue for an initial period of three months from
commencement but may, under certain conditions, be extended for up to one year.

_Administrator_

An administrator (rekonstruktör) is appointed by the court and supervises the day-to-day activities and
safeguards the interests of creditors as well as the debtor. However, the debtor remains in full possession of the
business except that, for important decisions such as paying a debt that has arisen prior to the order of
reorganization, granting security for a debt that arose prior to the order, undertaking new obligations or
transferring, pledging or granting rights in respect of assets of a substantial value for the business, the consent of
the administrator is required. However, the absence of such consent does not affect the validity of the transaction.

_Reorganization Plan, Creditors Meeting and Creditor’s Committee_

Upon an order by the court under the Swedish Reorganization Act, the administrator must notify the
creditors of the reorganization proceedings and will draw up a reorganization plan specifying the proposed action
to be taken to resolve the debtor’s problems. A creditors’ meeting will be held at which the creditors will be
given the opportunity to express their opinions as to whether the reorganization should continue. Upon the
request of any of the creditors, the court shall appoint a creditors’ committee of at most three persons. The
administrator shall, if possible, consult with the creditors’ committee prior to taking any important decisions.

_Moratorium_

The corporate reorganization proceedings do not have the effect of terminating existing contracts with the
debtor. Furthermore, the opening of corporate reorganization proceedings entails limitations on the contracting

314


-----

party’s right to terminate a contract, e.g. due to the debtor’s delay in payment. Such limitations are similar to
what is stated above in respect of a bankruptcy estate’s right to enter into existing contracts. However, the
limitations are not applicable where a creditor has security over, inter alia, financial instruments or receivables
originating from a loan granted by a credit institution. During the reorganization procedure, the debtor’s business
activities continue as normal. However, the procedure includes a suspension of payments to creditors and the
debtor cannot pay a debt that arose prior to the order of reorganization without the consent of the administrator
and such consent may only be granted should there be exceptional reasons for doing so and any petition for
bankruptcy in respect of the debtor will be stayed. A moratorium also applies to execution in respect of a claim
or enforcement of security during corporate reorganization proceedings unless the security assets are in the
physical possession of the secured creditor or any agent acting on behalf of such creditor, which is the case with a
Swedish law share pledge over the shares in a Swedish limited liability company where the share certificates of
such company have been physically delivered to the agent.

The debtor may apply to the court requesting public composition proceedings (offentligt ackord), which
means that the amount of a creditor’s claim may be reduced. The proposal for a public composition must meet
certain requirements such as that a sufficient proportion of the creditors which are allowed to vote, in respect of a
sufficient proportion of the outstanding claims, vote in favor of such public composition. Creditors with set-off
rights and secured creditors will not participate in the composition unless they wholly or partly waive their setoff rights or priority rights. Should the security not cover a secured creditor’s full claim, the remaining claim
will, however, be part of a composition. A creditors’ meeting is convened to vote on the proposed composition.
The public composition is a binding proceeding on all creditors that were entitled to participate, i.e. also creditors
who have not attended the creditors meeting will be bound.

**_Liquidation due to Capital Deficiency_**

Pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551), as amended (the “Swedish Companies Act”),
whenever a company’s board of directors has a reason to assume that, as a result of losses or reductions in the
value of the company’s assets or any other event, the company’s equity is less than half the registered share
capital, the company’s board of directors shall prepare a special balance sheet (Sw. kontrollbalansräkning) and
have the auditors examine it. The same obligation arises if the company in connection with enforcement pursuant
to Chapter 4 of the Swedish Enforcement Code (1981:774) is found to lack sizable assets. If the special balance
sheet shows that the equity of such company is less than half of the registered share capital, the board of directors
shall, as soon as possible, issue notice to call a shareholders’ meeting which shall consider whether the company
shall go into liquidation (initial shareholders’ meeting). The special balance sheet and an auditor’s report with
respect thereto shall be presented at the initial shareholders’ meeting.

If the special balance sheet presented at the initial shareholders’ meeting fails to show that, on the date of
such meeting, the equity of the company amounts to the registered share capital and the initial shareholders’
meeting has not resolved that the company shall go into liquidation, the shareholders’ meeting shall, within eight
months of the initial shareholders’ meeting, reconsider the issue whether the company shall go into liquidation
(second shareholders’ meeting). Prior to the second shareholders’ meeting, the board of directors shall prepare a
new special balance sheet and cause such to be reviewed by the company’s auditors. The new special balance
sheet and an auditor’s report thereon shall be presented at the second shareholders’ meeting. A shareholders’
resolution on liquidation of the company shall be registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office
(Bolagsverket), which shall appoint a liquidator. Should the shareholders not resolve on such voluntary
liquidation where required (which are where (i) a second shareholders’ meeting is not held within the period of
time stated above, or (ii) the new special balance sheet which was presented at the second shareholders’ meeting
was not reviewed by the company’s auditor or fails to show that, on the date of such meeting, the equity of the
company amounts to at least the registered share capital), the court may put the company into compulsory
liquidation and appoint a liquidator. The liquidator takes over management and control of the company and shall
sell the company’s assets and settle the company’s debts with the proceeds. The liquidator shall give notice to the
company’s unknown creditors and creditors that have not lodged their claims with the liquidator within six
months following such notice will have forfeited their rights to their claims.

If the board of directors fails to comply with the requirements relating to liquidation due to capital
deficiency (such as failure to prepare a special balance sheet and have the auditors examine it in case there are
reasons to assume that the company’s equity is less than half of its registered share capital), the members of the
board of directors may be liable for obligations incurred by the company during the period of such failure to act.
Also, any person who conducts business on the company’s behalf with knowledge of the board of directors’
failure to act may incur a similar liability. Liability shall however not be incurred by any person (including any
member of the board of directors) who proves that he or she was not negligent.

315


-----

**_Limitations on the Validity and Value of a Guarantee or Security Interest_**

_Corporate Benefit Rules_

If a Swedish limited liability company provides any security interest or guarantee without receiving
sufficient corporate benefit in return, such security interest or guarantee will, according to the Swedish
Companies Act, in whole or in part, constitute a transfer of value from a Swedish limited liability company (a
“Swedish Company”) which would be unlawful if: (i) the Swedish Company would lack cover for its restricted
equity capital after such value transfer (i.e., at the time the guarantee is provided or the security is granted); or
(ii) if it would not be considered prudent by the Swedish Company to undertake the value transfer after having
taken into consideration the equity requirements imposed by the nature, scope and risks relating to the Swedish
Company’s business or the Swedish Company’s need to strengthen its balance sheet, liquidity or financial
position.

This could be the case if, at the time the guarantee or security interest for the obligations of a third party is
provided, (i) the obligor of such obligation could be deemed unable to fulfill its obligation to indemnify the
Swedish Company if the guarantee is utilized or the security enforced and/or (ii) a Swedish company provides
any security interest or guarantee in respect of debt owed by a non-subsidiary of that Swedish company without
receiving sufficient corporate benefit in return.

The guarantees provided by a Swedish Company are limited in accordance with the above restrictions
relating to corporate benefit and are subject to limitation language limiting the liability of such entities
thereunder if required by the abovementioned restrictions relating to the distribution of assets.

_Financial Assistance_

The Swedish Companies Act also prohibits a Swedish Company from providing a guarantee or security
interest for a loan that is provided to facilitate the acquisition of shares in the Swedish Company or any other
superior member of the same Swedish group of companies and a Swedish Company may not provide a guarantee
or any security for the obligations of a parent or sister company, unless the parent company of the group, to
which the company and such parent or sister company belongs, is domiciled within the EEA.

The guarantees provided by a Swedish Company are limited in accordance with the above restrictions
relating to financial assistance in respect of the acquisition of shares in a Swedish Company or any other superior
member of the same Swedish group of companies and are subject to limitation language limiting the liability of
such entities thereunder if required by the abovementioned restrictions relating to such financial assistance.

**_Challengeable Transactions_**

In Swedish bankruptcy and, if certain conditions are met, company reorganization proceedings, transactions
can (in certain circumstances and subject to different time limits) be recovered. The goods or monies shall then
be re-distributed to the bankruptcy estate or the company subject to company reorganization. Broadly, these
transactions include, among others, situations where the debtor has conveyed property fraudulently or
preferentially to one creditor to the detriment of one or more of its other creditors before the initiation of the
relevant insolvency proceedings, created a new security interest, granted a guarantee or security that was either
not stipulated at the time when the secured obligation arose or not perfected without delay after such time and the
delay is not considered to be ordinary or paid a debt that is not due or that is considerable compared to the value
of the debtor’s assets or which is made by using unusual means of payment.

In the majority of situations, a claim for recovery can be made concerning actions which were made during
the three months preceding the commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings, notably in relation to
such granting of security where perfection is delayed. In certain situations longer time limits apply and in others
there are no time limits. These include, among others, situations where the other party to an agreement or other
arrangement is deemed to be a closely related party to the debtor, such as a subsidiary or parent company.

_Foreign Currency_

Swedish courts may award judgments in currencies other than Swedish kronor, but the judgment debtor has
the right to pay judgment debt, even though denominated in a foreign currency, in Swedish kronor at the rate of
exchange prevailing at the date of payment.

316

**Turkey**

**Bankruptcy**

One of the Guarantors, Wittur Asansör Sanayi ve Ticaret AS¸, is incorporated under Turkish law. In the
event of bankruptcy/insolvency, proceedings may be initiated in Turkey (Please note that in Turkish practice, the
term “bankruptcy” may be used in preference to insolvency when dealing with corporate insolvency). The
bankruptcy/insolvency laws of Turkey may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the
United States, the United Kingdom or other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar. Please find below a
general description of such laws.

Bankruptcy proceedings under Turkish law are governed by the Turkish Execution and Bankruptcy Law
No. 2004 (“Turkish Execution and Bankruptcy Law”). Along with the Turkish Execution and Bankruptcy
Law, the Turkish Commercial Code also defines the conditions of insolvency and sets forth the rules for filing
for bankruptcy.

Insolvency can be defined as a debtor’s inability to cover its debts, while bankruptcy is a status to be
determined by commercial courts, which announces the debtor’s inability to cover its debts by its assets. A
company may be bankrupt under several circumstances. Insolvency is one of the grounds for bankruptcy. A
company is deemed insolvent if its assets are not sufficient to cover its liabilities, or if the company is in financial
difficulty in making timely payments of its debts.

Any creditor may initiate a bankruptcy claim against a debtor which can be subject to the bankruptcy regime
at the execution office in the district of the debtor (“Execution Office”). Upon application of the creditor, the
execution officer sends a payment order to the debtor. If the debtor does not object to the payment order, it will
become final and the creditor must bring a case before the competent commercial court for declaration of the
debtor’s bankruptcy. If the debtor objects to the payment order within the term stipulated for each proceeding,
bankruptcy proceedings will cease and the creditor must bring a claim to the commercial court for annulment of
objection and declaration of debtor’s bankruptcy.

**_Direct Bankruptcy_**

In some cases, referred to as “direct bankruptcy proceedings,” a debtor may be declared bankrupt without a
payment order. Direct bankruptcy can be demanded by the creditors or the debtor.

A creditor can apply for direct bankruptcy where (inter alia):

    - the debtor engages or attempts to engage in fraudulent acts breaching the rights of its creditors;

    - the debtor conceals its property during compulsory execution by way of attachment;

    - the debtor has suspended its payments;

    - ten days have passed since the announcement of the termination of a restructuring project;

    - a concordat is not approved, the concordat period is cancelled, or the concordat is completely
dissolved;

    - the creditor’s claim based on a court decision has not been paid although its payment has been
demanded pursuant to an order of execution; or

    - the debtor company’s debts exceed its current assets.

Direct bankruptcy may also take place at the debtor’s request. A debtor can apply to a court to declare itself
bankrupt. This can occur in two circumstances:

_Voluntary Bankruptcy_

When the board of directors of a debtor discovers from the previous year’s annual balance sheet the erosion
of 1⁄2 of the sum of the company’s share capital and statutory reserves, then the board of directors must
immediately call an extraordinary general assembly meeting together with a proposal for remedial measures to be
submitted to general assembly’s approval in order to strengthen the debtor’s financial status. When a company
suffers losses which reduce its paid up share capital and statutory reserves by two-thirds, the board of directors is
required to call an extraordinary general assembly meeting. At this meeting, the shareholders must resolve either
to compensate the company in cash for the accumulated loss or to decrease the company’s paid-up share capital

317


-----

to one-third of its existing share capital. If any of these resolutions is not adopted at the meeting or if a meeting is
not convened at all, the company would be deemed dissolved pursuant to the Turkish Execution and Bankruptcy
Law and the Turkish Commercial Code.

If the shareholders do not take one of these steps, the board of directors is required to file a lawsuit before
the relevant commercial court to request the court to declare the company bankrupt. If the board of directors fail
to take such action, the directors shall be personally and jointly and severally liable for any and all real damages,
incurred by the creditors and the shareholders of such company.

_Mandatory Bankruptcy_

The debtor must apply to a court for bankruptcy if:

    - an attachment is ordered against a debtor which results in the debtor losing one-half of its assets; and

    - the debtor’s remaining assets are insufficient to meet its other debts which will be due and payable
within one year.

**_Avoidance of Transactions_**

According to the Turkish Execution and Bankruptcy Law, the bankruptcy administration (as defined below)
may bring an action before the commercial court to request that certain transactions of the debtor be set aside and
reversed. In certain exceptional cases, also individual creditors may bring an action of avoidance if they have not
been satisfied in full or the bankruptcy administration has agreed to such action.

The action of avoidance is brought against the debtor and the other party to the challenged transaction.
Three types of voidable transactions are (i) transactions made at an undervalue, (ii) inappropriate transactions and
(iii) transactions that constitute an intentional creditor defraud.

_Undervalue Transactions_

Contracts under which the consideration is materially less than the relevant market price may be declared
void by a court if they were entered into within two years prior to the commencement of insolvency/bankruptcy.

_Inappropriate Transactions_

The following transactions are considered inappropriate and may thus be set aside if they were entered into
within one year prior to insolvency/bankruptcy: (a) the provision of security by the debtor where the debtor
provided security to secure debt already existing and had not agreed earlier to do so; (b) any benefits granted by
the debtor not granted in cash or by other usual means of payment; (c) any repayment of debt which is not yet
due; and (d) transfers and registrations in relation to the land register strengthening the other party’s contractual
position.

However, the court may not set aside such transactions where the party benefiting from the transaction is
able to prove that, when entering into the transaction, it acted in good faith as regards the debtor’s financial
condition.

_Creditor Defraud_

Transfers made by the debtor intentionally against the creditors’ interests may also be set aside if made
within five years before the bankruptcy petition was filed. To have such transfers declared void by a court, the
claimant, i.e. usually the bankruptcy administration has to prove that the transferee, when entering into the
transaction, knew or should have known the debtor’s financial condition and also knew or should have known
that the debtor acted in violation of the principle of good faith.

**_Effects of Bankruptcy Proceedings_**

Upon initiation of bankruptcy proceedings, the court may order protective measures which the court deems
necessary for the protection of creditors. The execution/bankruptcy office is required to execute the court’s
orders. In addition, the court may require a written guarantee from the creditor(s) who demand protective
measures to secure compensation for the debtor for losses resulting from the protective measures, in case of

318


-----

improper bankruptcy proceedings. If the debtor has not objected to the payment order or claim resulting from the
court order, the court will not normally require a guarantee. A creditor who initiates the proceeding is liable for
the expenses that may arise in the period up to the initial creditors’ meeting. Such creditor may also require the
issuance of a property register of the debtor’s current assets at the time of the initiation of the court proceedings.

**_Decision on Bankruptcy_**

Under Turkish Law commercial courts decide whether debtor is bankrupt. For ordinary and special
bankruptcy proceedings before the commercial court, the bankruptcy petition must be published in nationwide
circulation newspapers as well as in the Commercial Register Gazette. Within fifteen (15) days from the
publication of a bankruptcy petition, other creditors may involve themselves in the proceedings, either by filing a
claim for dismissal or acceptance of bankruptcy demand. If there is no objection filed, or objections that have
been filed are dismissed, the commercial court will grant a depository injunction requiring the debt with accrued
interest and expenses to be paid by the debtor within seven (7) days from the delivery of depository injunction to
the debtor. If debtor pays or deposits such amount to the court, the bankruptcy case will be dismissed. If the
debtor does not, the debtor will be declared bankrupt by the court and the creditor who petitioned for the
bankruptcy must post security for costs and all notification expenses required for legal remedies of bankruptcy
decision in the period up to the initial creditors meeting. After the deposit of this amount with the commercial
court by the creditor, the court declares the debtor’s bankruptcy. This decision can be appealed within ten
(10) days.

For direct bankruptcy proceedings the same procedures apply as for ordinary proceedings, provided that the
court may issue a bankruptcy decision without a depository injunction option.

After the notification of the bankruptcy decision to the bankruptcy office, the bankruptcy office must send a
notification to the relevant authorities about bankruptcy decision immediately. The relevant authorities are; title
deed registry, commercial register, customs administration, the postal administration, the local chamber of
commerce, the chamber of industry and stock exchange, local notaries, banks, public administration, tax
administration, Ministry of Commerce, Turkish Banks Association, Capital Markets Board and other relevant
authorities.

**_Declaration of Bankruptcy_**

_Effect of the Declaration of Bankruptcy on a Debtor’s Assets_

All attachable assets of debtor are included in the bankruptcy estate (iflas masasi). These assets can include
the debtor’s movable and immovable properties, cash, receivables, joint or several title shares, right of usufruct,
inheritance share, fiscal rights on intellectual property. Pledged assets of the debtor are included in bankruptcy
estate but subject to the pledgee’s right of preference.

_Effect of the Declaration of Bankruptcy upon a Debtor_

The main effect of bankruptcy proceedings on the debtor is that all unpaid debts of the debtor become due
by the declaration of bankruptcy.

Bankruptcy proceedings do not limit the debtor’s capacity to act. Debtors have the power of disposition on
the assets which are not included in the bankruptcy estate. Although the debtor still remains the owner of assets
included in the bankruptcy estate, it does not have the right to dispose of them. After the declaration of
bankruptcy any disposition by the debtor of any asset in the bankruptcy estate is null and void.

Since a bankruptcy proceeding is a full proceeding (külli takip) and all the creditors are treated equally,
there is no need to have separate execution proceedings. For that reason at the bankruptcy proceedings any
execution claim brought against the debtor stops and no new execution proceeding, can be initiated.

Pending lawsuits involving the debtor as plaintiff or defendant which involve assets included within the
bankruptcy estate are suspended pending the bankruptcy proceedings.

**_Liquidation of Assets_**

After the declaration of a debtor’s bankruptcy, the attachable assets and the receivables of the debtor are
treated as part of the bankruptcy estate. The bankruptcy office takes the necessary measures to convene the initial
creditors’ meeting to nominate candidates to act as bankruptcy administration. The responsibility of the

319


-----

bankruptcy administration is to realize the assets of the debtor and to assure collection of the debts for the
creditors. The bankruptcy administration may also continue to operate the debtor and sell the business as an
going concern.

**_Creditors’ Committee_**

Within ten days of the publication of the ordinary liquidation announcement, the creditors are summoned to
the initial creditors’ meeting which decides on the administration and liquidation of the bankruptcy estate. The
main task of the creditors’ meeting is to elect the bankruptcy administration.

**_Bankruptcy Administration_**

Pursuant to Article 223 of the Turkish Execution and Bankruptcy Law, the bankruptcy administration is a
body of three members. The bankruptcy administration is the legal representative of the bankruptcy estate. The
main duties of the bankruptcy administration are directing and liquidating the bankruptcy estate under the
supervision of the bankruptcy office. Unless otherwise agreed by the creditors committee, members of the
bankruptcy administration represent the bankruptcy estate jointly. Members are liable for damages arising from
their default actions. They cannot enter into a contract on their own.

**_Postponement of Bankruptcy_**

The company (inter alia) can request the postponement of bankruptcy by presenting a recovery project
(iyilestirme projesi) to the commercial court. Upon the request of postponement of bankruptcy, the court appoints
a trustee to issue an inventory and act as board of directors or approve board of directors’ resolutions. The court
evaluates the reliability of the postponement request according to the information and documents which must be
presented to the court. The court may decide in one of three ways:

    - The court may dismiss the postponement of bankruptcy request on the ground that the conditions of the
bankruptcy do not exist and debtor is not bankrupt.

    - The court may find the request reasonable and order the postponement of bankruptcy. By this decision,
the court takes necessary measures to protect the assets of the debtor. The effect of this decision is that
no execution proceeding may be initiated against the debtor’s assets, proceedings which have been
initiated before the postponement decision stop. Bankruptcy can be postponed for at most one year.
This period can be extended by the terms stipulated by the court according to the trustee’s report.
However the period of postponement of bankruptcy cannot exceed five (5) years.

    - The court may reject the postponement request or determines the impossibility of the recovery at the
end of the postponement term, and declares the debtor bankrupt.

**_Main Practical Problems_**

Implementation duration is the major problem under Turkish bankruptcy law. Collection and registry of
receivables to bankruptcy estate, sale processes, liquidation, objections of creditors to other creditors’ rankings
are the main reasons for an extended timetable. In practice, an ordinary bankruptcy proceeding may take
approximately five years. Turkish insolvency procedures and in particular, the provisions of the Execution and
Bankruptcy Law are not favorable to creditors’ interests in terms of priority of creditors’ claims and term of
bankruptcy procedures. Therefore, it may limit the creditors’ ability to recover payments due on the Notes.

**_Distribution of Assets: Priority Claims and Ranking_**

After the liquidation process is completed, the collected cash is distributed to the creditors. The bankruptcy
administration issues a table for the distribution of the assets which reflects the following required order:

(i) first step is taken by payment of public debts from the amount obtained from liquidation of pledged
assets;

(ii) at second step, expenses related to the storage and realization of all pledged assets are allocated from
the foreclosure amount; and

(iii) pledged receivables are paid from the remainder of the pledged assets.

320


-----

After the satisfaction of the pledgees, any amount remaining is added to the bankruptcy estate and used for
the satisfaction the claims of the unsecured creditors. Such claims are satisfied in the following ranking as set out
under the Turkish Execution and Bankruptcy Law:

(i) employment related debts owed to employees; debts owed to the associations and the premises
established for the purposes of founding or supporting relief funds for the employees;

(ii) debts arising from guardianship and tutorship;

(iii) debts defined as “privileged debts” in specific laws (e.g. public debts); and

(iv) all other non-privileged debts.

**_Security Agent and Parallel Debt_**

It is uncertain as to whether Turkish law would recognize and give effect to a guarantee provided to a
security agent or trustee. The effectiveness of the grant of such guarantee to a security agent or trustee has not
been tested in a Turkish court.

**Limits on Enforceability of any Guarantee given by a Turkish Guarantor**

Pursuant to Article 380 of the Turkish Commercial Code, a Turkish company is not permitted to advance
funds, provide loans or security or a guarantee to a third party to facilitate the acquisition of its own shares and
any such transaction will be void. Since the guarantee to be provided by the Turkish Guarantor for the obligation
of the Issuer under the Notes is for the purpose of facilitating the acquisition of shares of the Target, which is not
the Turkish Guarantor, there is good argument that the provision of such guarantee does not fall within the
provision of Article 380 and therefore is valid and binding under Turkish law. However, this Article 380 has not
been tested in the Turkish courts and so it is possible that a Turkish court might decide that this guarantee falls
within the provisions of Article 380 and is therefore void.

Pursuant to Article 202 et seqq. of the Turkish Commercial Code, the parent company may not use its
domination in such manner to cause damages to the affiliated company. Accordingly, the affiliated company
cannot be forced or directed to assume liabilities or debts such as taking over a business or assets, a transfer of
debt, a transfer or reduction of profits, the creation of an encumbrance over its assets, the provision of surety and
a guarantee or aval (guarantee of bills), unless the resulting loss is equalized and compensated within the relevant
activity year or an equivalent right of claim is given to the affiliated company by the end of that operating year,
stating when and how the loss will be equalized. Otherwise, the shareholders and the creditors of the affiliated
company may claim from the parent company and the directors of the parent company to compensate the losses
of the affiliated company.

**Stamp Tax**

Pursuant to the Turkish Stamp Tax law (Law No. 488), subject to certain exemptions, each executed original
of any agreement which results in legal consequences in Turkey is subject to ad valorem stamp tax at a rate of
0.948% of the maximum amount referred to in the relevant agreement, subject to a cap of TL 1,702,138.00
(approx. US$ 725,060—as of 22 January 2015). The Financing and the relevant documentation thereunder are
not subject to any of the exemptions under the Turkish Stamp Tax law (Law No. 488) and consequently Turkish
stamp tax is payable on each executed original of the documents to which the Turkish Guarantor will be a party.
The non-payment of any Turkish stamp tax which is payable in relation to an agreement does not invalidate that
agreement and may be paid later with penalties and interest. The Guarantee provided by Wittur Asanso¨r San. V
Tic. A.S., our subsidiary in Turkey, will be limited to a maximum amount of €2.5 million. However, we cannot
provide any assurances that holders of the Notes will be able to recover even this amount under such Guarantee,
as payment under each Guarantee is contractually subordinated to all the senior indebtedness of such Guarantor,
including such Guarantor’s obligations under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations.

3 Estimates and judgements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying
assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in
which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

In preparing these consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in
applying the group’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those
that applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013.

4 Changes in the composition of the Group

As of September 30, 2014, the Group’s consolidated financial statements included, besides Wittur International
Holding GmbH, a total of 26 subsidiaries.

The trading of the following entities was transferred to Wittur GmbH, Wiedenzhausen, Germany during 2013
and thereafter became dormant and were liquidated during 2014:

Wittur kft., Budapest, Hungary
Wittur s.r.o., Hustopece, Czech Republic

5 Significant events and transactions

Wittur Hydraulic Drives s.r.l., Bagnatica, Italy was sold in September 2013. Land and building, owned by Wittur
S.p.A, Colorno in which Wittur Hydraulic Drives s.r.l. operated, was subsequently sold to the new owners of the
hydraulic drives business in January 2014.

To improve customer focus in eastern European countries, Wittur Sp. z o.o., Warsaw, Poland has moved to Rest
of World region from Europe & Africa.

6 Seasonality or cyclicality of interim operations

The financial results of the interim financial statements of the Group are not materially affected by seasonal or
cyclical events.

7 Financial risk management

The financial liabilities used by the Company mainly comprise bank loans and overdrafts, finance leases, debts
from supply and performance and hire purchase contracts and other loans granted. The main purpose of these
financial liabilities is the financing of the Group’s business activities. Various financial assets such as trade
receivables and cash which result directly from said business activities continue to be available to the Group.

The Group is exposed to the following risks from financial instruments:

 - credit risk,

 - liquidity risk, and

 - market risk

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management
information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements; they should be read in conjunction with
the Group’s annual financial statements as at December 31, 2013.

There have been no changes in the risk management department or in any risk management policies since the
year end.

The tables above do not include the shareholder loan, which matures in 2040. The carrying amounts are
KEUR 70,521 (December 31, 2013: KEUR 68,160). The fair values of the shareholder loan are KEUR 227,208
(December 31, 2013: KEUR 293,798).

For finances lease liabilities, it is assumed that their carrying amounts approximate their fair values.

For financial instruments with current maturities including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
payable as well as other receivables and payables it is assumed that their carrying amounts approximate their fair
values.

The fair values of non-current financial instruments are calculated as the present values of the estimated future
cash flows using market interest rates for discounting.

The fair values of non-current financial liabilities with variable interest rates are estimated to be equal to their
carrying amounts since the interest rates agreed and those available on the market do not significantly differ.

9 Additional disclosures on financial instruments (continued)

The following tables provide the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Group’s non-current assets and
liabilities.

The different hierarchy levels have been defined as follows:

Level 1 input are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the
measurement date. A quoted market price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value
and is used without adjustment to measure fair value whenever available, with limited exceptions.

Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in
active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs
other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and inputs that are derived principally from
or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (‘market-corroborated inputs’).

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are used to measure fair
value to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there
is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. An entity develops unobservable
inputs using the best information available in the circumstances, which might include the entity’s own data,
taking into account all information about market participant assumptions that is reasonably available.

The Group’s policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of fair value hierarchy levels as at the end of
the reporting period. There have been no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the interim
period.

For IFRS a different deprecation period for software was used based on the actual useful life of the assets. The
different deprecation periods used under German GAAP and IFRS resulted in a negative effect on equity
amounting KEUR -16 as of Dec. 31, 2012 (Jan. 01, 2012: KEUR -16).

In the consolidated financial statements of Wittur Group according to German GAAP goodwill is amortised over
a period of 15 years and transaction costs related to the acquisition of Wittur Group in 2010 have been
capitalized as part of the goodwill.

According to IFRS goodwill is not amortised. Instead, goodwill arising in a business combination is allocated to
cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and an impairment test

of the cash-generating units is performed at least annually. Transaction costs related to the acquisition have not
been capitalized as part of the goodwill, instead are expensed under IFRS.

Different treatments on goodwill resulted in an equity effect of KEUR 26,432 as of Dec. 31, 2012 (Jan. 01, 2012:
KEUR 3,366) and an effect on the net result of KEUR 23,065 in 2012.

Trade receivables and other receivables

General allowances for doubtful accounts receivable recognised in the consolidated financial statements
according to German GAAP are not permitted according to IFRS and have been released for accounting under
IFRS. The explained effects increased receivables and equity by KEUR 171 as of Dec. 31, 2012 (Jan. 01, 2012:
KEUR 171).

Inventories

The pure administrative surcharges in the consolidated financial statements according to German GAAP
recognised as a markup percentage during the intercompany profit-elimination on group level have been
eliminated for IFRS. This had an equity effect of KEUR -2,148 as of Dec. 31, 2012 (Jan. 01, 2012: KEUR
-2,364) and impact on the net result of KEUR 216 in 2012.

Non-controlling interests

The minority interests at Wittur Group do classify as puttable instruments according to IFRS and have been
reclassified from equity recognised under German GAAP to liabilities for the IFRS consolidated financial
statements. The reclassification had an effect on equity of KEUR -550 as of Dec. 31, 2012 (Jan. 01, 2012: KEUR
-580) and impact on net result of KEUR 30 of 2012.

Interest-bearing loans and borrowings

In the consolidated financial statements of Wittur Group according to German GAAP bank loans are recognised
at their nominal amount. For IFRS the effective interest method according to IAS 39 is applied. Under this
method a financial liability is recognised initially at fair value less transaction costs that are directly attributable
to the issue of the financial liabilities. Subsequently the liabilities are measured at amortised cost. The transaction
costs are amortised as interest expense through profit and loss with an increase in the liability. The effective
interest method leads to an effect on equity of KEUR 5,614 at Dec. 31, 2012 (Jan. 01, 2012: KEUR 7,272) and an
effect of KEUR -1,658 on net result in 2012.

Derivatives

In order to limit the interest rate risk arising from loans that bear a variable interest rate Wittur Group entered
into interest caps and swaps. Under IFRS the swaps and caps are measured at fair value through profit and loss.
As of Jan. 01, 2012 the fair value of the caps and swap increases liabilities by KEUR 945 with and negative
effect on equity, because no provision for the derivatives was recognised in the consolidated financial statement
according to German GAAP. As of as Dec. 31, 2012 the derivatives were also recognised in the consolidated
statements according to German GAAP and resulted in an impact on net result of KEUR 945.

Provisions for pensions and other employee benefits

For determinating the defined benefit obligations of the provisions for pensions and other employee benefits
different discount rates under German GAAP and IFRS must been used.

1.3 Explanation of transition to IFRS (continued)

Provisions for pensions and other employee benefits (continued)

Under IFRS actuarial gains and losses resulting from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial
assumptions have been recognised directly in equity.

The different treatments had an effect on equity of KEUR -1,907 as of Dec. 31, 2012 (Jan. 01, 2012:
KEUR -308) and an impact of KEUR 325 on net result and of KEUR -1,535 on comprehensive income in 2012.

Finance lease

Under IFRS, some leases with the Group as lessee are classified as finance leases which were treated as operating
leases under German GAAP. For IFRS those leased assets have been capitalised and a lease liability is
recognised. The lease expenses recognised under German GAAP are reversed for IFRS and allocated to the
repayment of the lease liability und an interest portion. This had an inpact on equity of KEUR 187 as of Dec. 31,
2012 (Jan. 1, 2012: KEUR 135) and an effect on net result from the depreciation of leased assets and interest
expenses amounting KEUR 52 in 2012.

Deferred taxes

The adjustments as described above resulted in additional differences between the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities in the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements and their tax basis. Deferred taxes were recognised on
temporary differences. This resulted on a positive impact on equity of KEUR 4,117 as of Dec. 31, 2012 and
KEUR 2,153 as of Jan. 1, 2012 and a positive effect on net result of KEUR 1,845 in 2012.

Current taxes

In HGB 2012 a current taxes adjustment was reversed in P&L as no longer required, however this was adjusted
in equity within the IFRS opening balance sheet, therefore impacting IFRS net result of KEUR-347 in 2012.

Exchange differences on translation of foreign operations

According to IFRS exchange differences on translation of foreign operations are recognised in the other
comprehensive income amounting KEUR - 556 as of Dec. 31, 2012.

Consolidated statement of cash flows

Differences between HGB and IFRS in the consolidated statement of cash flows mainly arise from the allocation
of cash in- and outflow to operating, investing and financing activities.

1.4 Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statement comprises the statement of Wittur International Holding GmbH and its
subsidiaries as at December 31, 2013. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the
Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its
activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that currently are exercisable are taken into account. The
financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that
control commences until the date that control ceases. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed
when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group. Internal Group profit and loss, expenses
and revenues as well as receivables and liabilities between consolidated companies are eliminated.

1.5 Consolidated companies

The Group’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2013 include, besides Wittur International
Holding GmbH, a total of 28 subsidiaries. In 2013 two companies were merged and one company was sold. For

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

2 Estimates and judgements

2.1 General provisions

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying
assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in
which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

The assumptions and estimates principally relate to the consolidation of business combinations, the assessment of
the recoverability of the carrying amount of intangible assets (in particular goodwill), the group-wide
determination of useful lives of material assets, taxation and the recognition of deferred tax assets and the
measurement and recognition of provisions for pensions and other provisions. Assumptions and estimates are
based on premises derived from knowledge at the time.

Within the scope of business combinations, general estimates are also made when determining the fair values of
the assets acquired. In principle fair value is determined based on the prognosis of future cash flow.

2.2 Economic useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets

The applied economic lives of non-current assets are based on estimates of the management. The Group reviews
the estimated economic useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at the end of every
financial year.

2.3 Taxation

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to routine tax audits and also a process whereby tax computations
are discussed and agreed with the respective authorities. Whilst the ultimate outcome of such tax audits and
discussions cannot be determined with certainty, management estimates the level of provisions required for both
current and deferred tax on the basis of professional advice and the nature of current discussions with the tax
authority concerned.

2.4 Estimates and assumptions

The key assumptions concerning the future economic situation and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at
the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.

Impairment of non-financial assets

The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting
date. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and at other times when such indicators exist. Other
non-financial assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying amounts may not be
recoverable.

Deferred tax assets

Management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised based
upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future tax
planning strategies. For further details refer to note 5.8 Income taxes.

Fair value of financial instruments

The Group measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives, and non-financial assets such as investment
properties, at fair value at each balance sheet date. Also, fair values of financial instruments measured at
amortised cost are disclosed in Note 7 Additional disclosures on financial instruments.

**Wittur International Holding GmbH**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

2 Estimates and judgements (continued)

2.4 Estimates and assumptions (continued)

Fair value of financial instruments (continued)

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use
when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair
value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use
the asset in its highest and best use.

The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are
available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of
unobservable inputs.

The fair values of the derivatives are presented in the balance sheet on a gross basis.

Pension and other post-employment benefits

The carrying amount of defined benefit pensions plans and other post-employment benefits are based on actuarial
valuations. The actuarial valuations involved making assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return
on assets, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long term nature of
these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. The net pension liability at December 31, 2013
is KEUR 8,785 (2012: KEUR 9,597). Further details are given in note 5.22 Provisions for pensions.

Other provisions

Such provisions are recognised when it is considered probable that economical, legal, ecological and
decommissioning obligations will result in future outflows of economic benefits, when the costs can be estimated
reliably and the measures in question are not expected to result in future inflows of economic benefits. The
estimate of future costs is subject to many uncertainties, including legal uncertainties based on the applicable
laws and regulations and with uncertainties regarding to the actual conditions in the different countries and
operating locations. In particular, estimates of costs are based on earlier experiences in similar cases, the
conclusions of expert opinions commissioned by the Group, current costs and new developments that have a
bearing on the costs. Any changes to these estimates could have an impact on the future results of the Group. At
December 31, 2013, the carrying amount of recognised other provisions were KEUR 8,191 (2012: KEUR 7,358).

3 Significant accounting policies

The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently by all Group entities.

3.1 New accounting standards and interpretations

Wittur Group applied all effective standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and the IFRIC for
preparation of the consolidated financial statements if their application was required as of December 31, 2013.

3.1 New accounting standards and interpretations (continued)

The following standards and interpretations have been issued by the IASB prior to the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements and must be adopted for reporting periods starting January 1, 2014 or at a later
date. Wittur Group will adopt them at their mandatory effective date and has analyzed the effects caused by the
implementation.

1) The original regulations of the IASB required an application starting in fiscal year 2013. In the Official
Journal of the European Union, L360 dated December 29, 2012, however, the European Commission
enacted an initial application date for the amendments for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2014.

IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements” will prescribe a new harmonized consolidation model. IFRS 10 no
longer distinguishes between traditional subsidiaries (IAS 27) and special-purpose entities (SIC-12). According
to IFRS 10 the pivotal criteria of consolidating an entity is having its control. IFRS 10 defines control if an
investor has the power over an investee, is exposed to variable returns and is able to use power to affect its
amount of variable returns. IFRS 10 will replace SIC-12 “Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities” as well as
the requirements relevant to consolidated financial statements in IAS 27 “Consolidated and Separate Financial
Statements.”

Based on the current structure of Wittur Group and its economic relations there are no changes expected that will
affect the results of operations, financial positions or cash flows.

IFRS 11 “Joint Arrangements” will replace IAS 31 “Interests in Joint Ventures” and SIC-13 “Jointly Controlled
Entities – NonMonetary Contributions by Venturers.” IFRS 11 governs the accounting for joint ventures and

joint operations. Proportionate consolidation for joint ventures will no longer be permissible as a result of the
discontinuation of IAS 31. Amended IAS 28 “Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures” will now govern the
application of the equity method when accounting for investments in both associates and joint ventures. In case
of a joint operation, the share of assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues is directly recognised in the
consolidated financial statements and annual financial statements of the joint operator.

Based on the current structure of Wittur Group and its economic relations there are no changes expected that will
affect the results of operations, financial positions or cash flows.

IFRS 12 “Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities” will prescribe the information to be disclosed in the notes to
the financial statements about interests in subsidiaries, associates, joint arrangements and non-consolidated
structured entities. The objective of these disclosures is to enable the users of an entity’s financial statements to
understand the nature of its interests in other entities, the risks associated with them, and the effects of the
interests on its financial position and results of operations.

Wittur Group does not expect major changes in presentation of the results of operations, financial positions or
cash flows caused by the implementation.

IAS 27 “Separate Financial Statements” was renamed and adapted together with the enacting of IFRS 10 and will
now exclusively govern the accounting for subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in their separate annual
financial statements and the corresponding notes.

Wittur Group does not expect effects on the results of operations, financial positions or cash flows caused by the
implementation.

IAS 28 “Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures” was renamed and adapted together with the enacting of
IFRS 11. IAS 28 will govern the accounting of investments in associates and joint ventures which are in the
scope of IFRS 11 using the equity method.

Wittur Group does not expect effects on the results of operations, financial positions or cash flows caused by the
implementation.

IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation” was amended to specify the requirements for offsetting financial
instruments. To meet the new offsetting requirements in IAS 32, an entity’s right to set off must not be
contingent on a future event and must be enforceable both in the normal course of business and in the event of
default or insolvency of the entity and all counterparties. It is further specified that a gross settlement mechanism
also complies with the offsetting requirements according to IAS 32, provided no major credit liquidity risks
remain, and receivables and payables are processed in a single settlement step, making it equivalent to a net
settlement.

Wittur Group does not expect major changes in the results of operations, financial position or cash flows caused
by the implementation.

IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” was amended to modify the disclosures on recoverable amounts of impaired
assets. The disclosures were initially amended as a consequence of the release of IFRS 13 “Fair Value
Measurement” and now clarify that the disclosure of information about the recoverable amount of impaired
assets is limited to the recoverable amount of impaired assets that is based on fair value less costs of disposal.

Wittur Group does not expect major changes in the results of operations, financial position or cash flows caused
by the implementation.

IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” was amended to allow hedge accounting to
continue in a situation where a derivative, which has been designated as a hedging instrument, is novated to
effect clearing with a central counterparty as a result of laws or regulation, if specific conditions are met.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

3 Significant accounting policies (continued)

3.1 New accounting standards and interpretations (continued)

The accounting and presentation of the derivatives hold at Wittur Group are not affected by the amended
Standard. Wittur Group therefore does not expect changes in the results of operations, financial position or cash
flows.

IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” will govern the classification and measurement of financial assets and will
replace IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”. IFRS 9 defines two instead of four
measurement categories (IAS 39) for financial assets, with classification to be based partly on the company’s
business model and partly on the characteristics of the contractual cash flows from the respective financial asset.
In the case of equity investments that are not held for trading, an entity may choose at initial recognition to
recognize future changes in their fair value in other comprehensive income. The disclosure requirements under
IFRS 7 concerning the first-time application of IFRS 9 were amended at the same time.

Wittur Group does not expect major changes in results of operations, financial position or cash flows caused by
the implementation of the new standard.

IFRIC Interpretation 21 “Levies” will clarify how an entity should account for liabilities to pay levies imposed
by governments, other than income taxes, in its financial statements. The discussed question is when the entity
should recognize a liability to pay a levy. IFRIC 21 is an interpretation of IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent
Liabilities and Contingent Assets”. IAS 37 sets out criteria for the recognition of a liability, one of which is the
requirement for the entity to have a present obligation as a result of a past event (obligating event). The
interpretation now clarifies that the obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity
described in the relevant legislation that triggers the payment of the levy.

Wittur Group does not expect changes in results of operations, financial position or cash flows caused by the
implementation of the interpretation.

3.2 Foreign currencies

The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in euros (KEUR), which is also the parent
company’s functional currency. For each entity the Group determines the functional currency and items included
in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. The Group uses the direct
method of consolidation and has elected to recycle the gain or loss that arises from this method.

Transactions and balances

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group entities at their respective functional
currency spot rate at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency spot rate of exchange ruling at the
reporting date. Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss
with the exception of monetary items that are designated as part of the hedge of the Group’s net investment of a
foreign operation. These are recognised in other comprehensive income until the net investment is disposed of, at
which time, the cumulative amount is classified to profit or loss. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange
differences on those monetary items are also recorded in other comprehensive income.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the
exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss
arising on translation of non-monetary measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of gain or loss
on change in fair value in the item (i.e., the translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is
recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).

Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation subsequent to 1 January 2012 and any fair value
adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and
liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.

3.2 Foreign currencies (continued)

Transactions and balances (continued)

Prior to 1 January 2012, the date of transition to IFRS, the Group treated goodwill and any fair value adjustments
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition as assets and liabilities of the parent.
Therefore, those assets and liabilities are non-monetary items already expressed in the functional currency of the
parent and no further translation differences occur.

Group companies

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into euros at the rate of exchange prevailing at the
reporting date and their income statements are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. The exchange differences arising on the translation are recognised in other comprehensive income.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of other comprehensive income relating to that particular
foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.

3.3 Revenue

Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of
returns, trade discounts and volume rebates. Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of
ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and
possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the
goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.

3.4 Intangible assets

Purchased intangible assets

Purchased intangible assets are recognised at cost or, if acquired in a business combination, at their respective
fair values. They are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful lives. With the exception of goodwill no
intangible asset with indefinite useful life is recognised. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are subject
to an annual impairment test and not to scheduled amortisation.

3.4 Intangible assets (continued)

Purchased intangible assets (continued)

Scheduled amortisation of intangible assets may take place over the following useful life period:

**Useful life**
**in years**

Intangible assets 3 – 20

Research and development costs

Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with purpose of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and
understanding, is recognised in profit or loss when incurred.

Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and
processes. Development expenditure is capitalized only if development costs can be measured reliably, the
product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the
Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. When the excess is negative (badwill) it is
recognised immediately in profit or loss. Capitalized goodwill is not subject to amortisation. It is assessed
annually for impairment and can be assessed more frequently, if there might be any indication for impairment
during the year.

3.5 Property, plant and equipment

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed
assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets
to a working condition for their intended use and the costs of dismantling and removing the items.

If parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate
items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the
proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised net within
other operating income or other operating expenses in profit or loss.

The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the
item, if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its
cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.

Depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of
an item of property, plant and equipment. Leased assets under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of
the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the
end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are
reviewed at each reporting date.

3.6 Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalized as part of the cost of the
asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of
interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.

3.7 Impairment of intangible assets and of property, plant and equipment

The carrying amounts of the Group’s intangible assets and items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed
at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists,
the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill the recoverable amount is estimated at least once in a
year at the same time.

The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of the attributable fair value less the costs to sell and value in
use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to
the asset. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the difference is recognised as an impairment
loss in the income statement. For the impairment test, assets are reflected at the lowest level for which cash flows
are separately identifiable. If the cash flow for an asset is not separately identifiable, the impairment test is
conducted on the basis of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. Goodwill is allocated to
CGU’s to perform an annual impairment test on goodwill. The allocation is made to those CGU’s or groups of
CGU’s that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose identified
according to operating segment.

An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs
are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGUs and then to reduce the
carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed even in case of subsequent increase in value. In respect
of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any
indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed, if there has been a
change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined,
net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

3.8 Investment Properties

IAS 16 and IAS 40 permit investment properties to be carried at historical cost less provisions for depreciation
and impairment.

3.8 Investment Properties (continued)

Investment properties are derecognised either when they have been disposed of or when they are permanently
withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from their disposal. The difference between the
net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in the income statement in the period of
derecognition.

The estimated useful live for the current and comparative periods is as follows:

**Useful life**
**in years**

Investment properties 25

3.9 Inventories

Inventories include raw materials and supplies, work in progress, semi-finished goods, finished goods and
merchandise.

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realisable value. The cost of inventories includes expenditure
incurred in acquiring the inventories, production costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing
location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost of inventories includes
direct material and production costs and an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating
capacity.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of
completion and selling expenses.

3.10 Income taxes

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in profit or loss except
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the reporting date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation
purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets
or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable
profit or loss, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will
not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognised for taxable temporary differences
arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they
reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are offset, if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets and
they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different tax entities,
but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be
realised simultaneously.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will
be available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine
the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future
taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.

3.10 Income taxes (continued)

A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date
and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

3.11 Financial instruments

Financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets,
loans and borrowings, trade and other payables as well as other financial liabilities.

_Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits._

Financial assets are recognised initially at fair value and, for instruments not at fair value through profit or loss,
any directly attributable transaction costs. Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the
trade-date – the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Subsequent measurement depends
on the categorisation of the financial instrument as described below:

_Loans and receivables comprise trade receivables and other financial assets and are measured at amortised cost_
less any impairment losses. Impairment losses on trade receivables are recognised using separate allowance
accounts. Amounts charged to the allowance account are generally written off when there is no expectation of
recovering additional cash.

_Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss: An instrument is classified at fair value through profit_
or loss, if it is held for trading or is designated as such upon initial recognition. Financial instruments are
designated at fair value through profit or loss if the Group manages such investments and makes purchase and
sale decisions based on their fair value in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or
investment strategy. Upon initial recognition attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss when
incurred. Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value and changes therein
are recognised in profit or loss. The Group does not apply the fair value option but has derivatives which fall into
the sub-category held for trading.

Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or
have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Financial liabilities are measured at fair value on initial recognition. For all financial liabilities not subsequently
measured at fair value through profit or loss, the transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are also
recognised. Trade payables and other financial liabilities are generally measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is shown in the Group’s balance sheet only if, at the
relevant balance sheet date, there is a legitimate claim to offset the amounts accounted for against each other and
if it is intended that a settlement be made on a net basis or that the liability in question be extinguished at the
same time by realising the asset concerned.

3.12 Financial income and expenses

Financial income comprises interest income on funds invested and changes in the fair value of derivative
financial instruments. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest
method.

Financial expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions, changes
in the fair value of derivative financial instruments, impairment losses recognised on financial assets. All
borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.

3.13 Impairment of financial assets

The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of
financial assets is impaired. An impairment exists if one or more events that has occurred since the initial
recognition of the asset (an incurred ‘loss event’), has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the
financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. Objective evidence of impairment
may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty,
default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other
financial reorganisation and observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future
cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.

3.14 Provisions for pensions and other employee benefits

Pensions for provisions and other employee benefits are carried as liabilities in accordance with IAS 19.67 using
the projected unit credit method. The Group accounts for actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive
income. The same applies to past service costs. The amount which has to be accounted for as a liability from a
defined-benefit pension plan comprises of the cash value of the defined-benefit pension obligation less the fair
value of the plan assets which exist for the direct fulfilment of obligations. Actuarial valuations for the
obligations are drawn up annually on the balance sheet date. An actuarial valuation is made on the basis of
various assumptions. These include the calculation of the discount rates for unaccrued interest, future wage and
salary increases, the mortality rate and future pension increases. Because the valuation and the assumptions on
which it is based are complex and long-term, a performance-related obligation reacts very sensitively indeed to
any change in said assumptions. All assumptions are thus reviewed on each annual financial statement date.

3.15 Other provisions

A provision is recognised, if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation
that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the
obligation. If the effect of discounting is material, provisions are measured at their present value. The amount
assumed to flow out in the subsequent year is recognised as current portion of the provision.

3.16 Leases

Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as
finance leases. Upon initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair
value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is
accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease payments made
under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability.

Rental and lease payments made by the Group under operating leases are recognised in other operating expenses
as they incur.

3.17 Government grants

Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all
attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income
on a systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed.
When the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as income in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the
related asset.

When the Group receives grants of non-monetary assets, the asset and the grant are recorded at nominal amounts
and released to profit or loss over the expected useful life in a pattern of consumption of the benefit of the
underlying asset by equal annual instalments. When loans or similar assistance are provided by governments or
related institutions, with an interest rate below the current applicable market rate, the effect of this favourable
interest is regarded as a government grant.

4 Financial risk management

The financial liabilities used by the Company mainly comprise bank loans and overdrafts, finance leases, debts
from supply and performance and hire purchase contracts and other loans granted. The main purpose of these
financial liabilities is the financing of the Group’s business activities. Various financial assets such as trade
receivables and cash which result directly from said business activities continue to be available to the Group.

The Group is exposed to the following risks from financial instruments:

    - credit risk,

    - liquidity risk, and

    - market risk

This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives,
policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the Group’s management of capital.

The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set
appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.

4.1 Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group, if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to
meet its contractual obligations. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit
exposure.

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is mainly influenced by the individual characteristics of each customer. The
Group only concludes business transactions with creditworthy third parties. All customers wishing to conclude
business transactions with the Group on credit are subjected to a test of their creditworthiness. In addition to that,
the receivables are monitored continuously, so that the Group is not exposed to any substantial risks of nonpayment. In the case of transactions which are not carried out in the country of the operative unit concerned no
credits are granted without prior approval from the head of accounts receivable controlling. There are no
substantial concentrations of non-payment risks in the Group. The Group does not see a credit risk for financial
assets that are neither past due nor impaired.

4.2 Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due,
e.g. settlement of its financial debt and paying its suppliers. The Group’s approach of managing liquidity is to
ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both
normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s
reputation.

The Group continuously monitors the risk of a liquidity bottleneck using a liquidity planning tool. It is the aim of
the Group to maintain a balance between ongoing coverage of the need for funds and the guarantee of flexibility
by the use of overdrafts, loans, finance leases and hire purchase contracts.

Beyond effective working capital and cash management, the Group mitigates liquidity risk by having undrawn
credit facilities.

repayment of the shareholder loan of KEUR 70,000 in 2013 plus undiscounted payments on interest on it of
KEUR 869,136.

4.3 Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market prices. Market risk comprises the following types of risk: foreign currency exchange rate risk
and interest rate risk. Financial instruments exposed to market risk include interest-bearing loans and derivative
financial instruments.

Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net
investments in foreign operations. Foreign currency exposures of individual affiliates are managed and optimised
against the functional currency of the respective entity.

4.3 Market risk (continued)

Foreign exchange risk (continued)

Foreign currency risks exist as there are sales and purchases in different currencies. Management is in process to
analyse the underlying risks and to implement adequate instruments to mitigate these risks.

Foreign currency risks the Group is exposed to result from its operating activities. Although Group entities
mainly operate in their individual functional currency, some Group entities are exposed to foreign currency risks
based on planned payments in a currency other than their functional currency.

Foreign currency risks are presented by application of sensitivity analyses required by IFRS 7. These show the
effects of hypothetical changes of relevant risk variables on result before tax as a consequence of upward
revaluation and devaluation of EUR against CNY and EUR against TRY which are material for the group. All
other currencies are not material. In the scope of these analyses are financial instruments being denominated in a
currency that is not the functional currency and being of a monetary nature. According to the requirements of
IFRS 7 differences resulting from the translation of financial statements into the Group’s presentation currency
are not taken into consideration. No effects, except for those from result before tax, resulted on shareholders’
equity. As hedge accounting is not applied, there are no effects on other comprehensive income.

Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk of fair values and / or cash flows being negatively affected by changes in interest
rates.

The Group is exposed to interest rate risks from loans with variable interest rates. Interest rate risks are presented
by way of sensitivity analyses in accordance with IFRS 7. These show the effects of changes in market interest
rates on finance income and expense. The interest rate sensitivity analyses are based on the following
assumptions:

Changes in the market interest rates of all non-derivative financial instruments with fixed interest rates that are
carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk as defined in IFRS 7.

Interest rate changes also impact profit or loss because of interest rate derivatives.

5.8 Income taxes (continued)

The following table shows the amount of the deferred taxes before netting to be expected to be recovered or
settled prior / after more than 12 months:

KEUR **Dec. 31, 2013** Dec. 31, 2012

Deferred tax assets:

   - Deferred tax assets to be recovered after more than 12 months **10,268** 9,658

   - Deferred tax asset to be recovered within 12 months **2,102** 3,109

**12,370** **12,767**

Deferred tax liabilities:

   - Deferred tax liability to be recovered after more than 12 months **16,168** 21,069

   - Deferred tax liability to be recovered within 12 months **259** 789
**16,427** **21,857**

Deferred taxes are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will be
realisable. Country-specific tax rates were used in each case to calculate deferred taxes.

The following table reconciles the expected income tax expense to the actual income tax expense presented in the
consolidated financial statements. The effective tax expense results from the application of an income tax rate of
26.3% (2012: 26.3%) to consolidate profit for the period (before taxes) in accordance with IFRS. The income tax
rate is made up of corporation tax at 15% (2012: 15%), a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% (2012: 5.5%) and trade tax
at 10.5% (2012: 10.5%). The tax rate applied is the German tax rate.

**Income taxes** **-9,268** **-5,102**

Effective income tax rate **53.0%** 92.9%

The non-deductible expenses result mainly from non-deductible interest (thereof Germany 2013: KEUR 2,324;
2012: KEUR 2,666) and non-refundable withholding taxes (thereof Germany 2013: KEUR 485; 2012:
KEUR 257 and Italy 2013: KEUR 1,150; 2012: KEUR 1,951).

The Group has tax losses of KEUR 26,470 (2012: KEUR 26,261) that are available for offset against future
taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose. Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carryforward of KEUR 21,892 (2012: KEUR 23,496) to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit

through future taxable profits are expected. The deferred tax assets amounting to KEUR 5,120 (2012:
KEUR 5,615) have been recognised in respect of these losses. The Group did not recognise income tax assets in
respect of losses amounting to KEUR 4,578 (2012: KEUR 2,765). Losses amounting to KEUR 171 (2012: nil)
expire in 2014.

Apart from tax loss carry forwards, no deferred tax assets on interest carry forwards amounting to KEUR 25,394
(2012: KEUR 16,739) were recognised in Germany as it is not probable that these interest carry forwards can be
utilised.

**Total Goodwill** **95,053** **95,053** **95,053**

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least once a year by comparing the carrying amounts of the regions to which
goodwill is allocated with their value in use. Value in use is determined using the discounted cash flow method
based on the current three year planning for the region concerned. The principal planning assumptions are
expected market trends in relation to the company’s development, changes in production and other cost, changes
in discount rates. Assumptions are based on general market forecasts, current developments and past experience.
The long-term growth rate used are a maximum of 1% p.a.. Cash flows are forecasted on the basis of revenue and
cost projections for each region to which goodwill is allocated. The discount rate applied is the pre-tax weighted
cost of capital for 2013 by region is as follows:

**Dec. 31,**
**2013/2012**
**Analysis of pre-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital**
Europe & Africa **8.6%**
Eurasia **14.9%**

Goodwill is impaired if the region’s value in use is less than its carrying amount. The value in use of all CGUs
exceeded their carrying values at the impairment test date. Reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions
would not cause a goodwill impairment.

**Other comprehensive income** **-4,339** **-93** **-4,431**

Capital management

The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to maintain a capital structure that contributes to the
creation of shareholder value. Wittur aims to manage its capital in a way that supports the profitable growth of
operations by securing an adequate liquidity and capitalization of the group at all times ensuring the ability to
meet the financial obligations.

In order to achieve this overall objective, the Group’s capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure
that it meets financial covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans and borrowings that define capital
structure requirements. Breaches in meeting the financial covenants would permit the bank to immediately call
loans and borrowings. There have been no breaches in the financial covenants of any interest-bearing loans and
borrowing in the current period.

The Group considers both capital and net debt as relevant components of funding, hence, part of its capital
management. The Group manages the equity as capital under IFRS amounting to KEUR -1,702 (2012: KEUR
-4,893).

The Group includes within net debt: interest bearing loans and borrowings from banks and finance leases; less
cash and short-term deposits, excluding discontinued operations.

The assets employed in Wittur’s business consist principally of net working capital, fixed assets, and investments
which are funded by equity and net debt. Cash flow from operations is the principal source of Wittur’s financing.
External funding, as well as cash and cash equivalents, are managed centrally by the Group Treasury according
to the Group Treasury Policy. Liquid assets are invested only in counterparties with high creditworthiness and
deposits to ensure continuous access to the funds.

No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended
31 December 2013 and 2012.

No Group companies were subject to minimum capital requirements requested by external parties.

5.21 Interest bearing loans and borrowings

Wittur entered into a Senior Facility Agreement dated December 6, 2010. Wittur initially received two term
facilities (A, B) with a nominal amount of KEUR 72,500 each at December 22, 2010. The maturity of facility A
is December 6, 2016; the maturity of facility B is December 6, 2017. At September 5, 2013 the Senior Facility
Agreement was amended. Wittur received a term facility (C) with a nominal amount of KEUR 60,000 at the
reporting date. The maturity of facility C is December 7, 2018. The repayment of facility C is done at the
termination date. The facility loans are bearing a variable interest rate based on the 1 month- EURIBOR interest
rate plus a margin rate. The effective interest rates are in the range of 3.23% to 4.48% (2012: 3.11% to 4.36%).

The amount of borrowing costs capitalized during the year 2013 for facility (C) was KEUR 2,878.

Together with the term loan facilities an additional revolving credit facility including ancillary facilities of
KEUR 30,000 max. was granted. The total revolving credit facility is split in an initial revolving credit facility
and ancillary facilities. These credit and ancillary facilities are concluded with different banks. The revolving
credit facilities are bearing a variable interest rate. The interest rate is based on an interest reference rate plus a
margin.

The Senior Facility Agreement contains financial covenants as leverage cover, interest cover, CAPEX limitation
and cash flow cover. Wittur is in compliance with all these covenants.

The following collateral was provided under the above mentioned Senior Facility Agreement:

    - Pledging of bank accounts (2013: KEUR 19,998, 2012: KEUR 22,372)

    - General assignments concerning all receivables, including insurance benefits (2013: KEUR 85,179,
2012: KEUR 77,924)

    - Mortgages (KEUR 46,000 in 2013 and 2012)

    - Assignments of assets (2013: KEUR 378,832, 2012: KEUR 389,538)

Given the positive economic situation in key markets, the position of the individual Group companies in the
respective markets and positive results of operations, it is currently not expected that the collateral will be
utilized.

5.22 Provisions for pensions

Defined contribution plans

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as employee benefit expense
in the profit or loss when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as asset to the extent that a cash
refund or a reduction in future payments is available.

Beside statutory pension funds, e.g. the German statutory pension insurance scheme (“Deutsche
Rentenversicherung”), the Group operates no employer-financed defined contribution plans. The Group has paid
and expensed KEUR 640 during 2013 (2012: KEUR 586) for German statutory pension insurance scheme.

Defined benefit plans

The Company operates various defined benefit pension schemes. Beneficiaries of these plans are employees in
different countries, in particular in Germany, Austria, Italy and Turkey.

The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows:


Dec. 31,
2012

KEUR


**Dec. 31,**
**2013**


Present value of funded Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO) **12,419** 12,289 10,043
Fair value of plan assets **-3,634** -2,691 -2,218

**Net liability** **8,785** **9,598** **7,825**

Of the figure shown for total benefit obligations as of December 31, 2013, KEUR 4,563 relates to the defined
benefit plans in Germany, KEUR 3,814 to the plans in Austria, KEUR 2,718 to the plans in Italy and KEUR 951
to the plans in Turkey.

The expected contributions to be made within the next 12 months (next annual reporting period) out of the
defined benefit plan obligations are KEUR 424 (2012: KEUR 541).

The plan assets consist of a liability insurance for the German defined benefit plan. There is no market price
quotation in an active market with respect to the liability insurance. The fair value is based on actuarial
calculations.

The amounts recognised in the income statement concerning defined benefit plans were as follows:

KEUR **2013** **2012**

Current service cost 1,278 761
Interest cost 323 404

**Total** **1,601** **1,165**

The Projected Unit Credit method was used for the valuation of pension provisions. The principal assumptions
used in determining pension provisions for the Group’s plans are shown below:

**Dec. 31,** Dec. 31, Jan. 1,
**2013** 2012 2012
Discount rate:
Germany **3.40%** 3.00% 4.75%
Austria **3.40%** 3.00% 4.75%
Italy **3.40%** 3.00% 4.75%
Netherlands **3.40%** 3.00% 4.75%

Netherlands **0.00%** 0.00% 0.00%
Turkey **5.60%** 5.62% 5.00%

As biometric bases, the 2005G mortality tables by Klaus Heubeck are used for Germany and Austria, the
RG48 tables and C.N.R. of the University of Rome (reduced by 30%) are used for Italy, and the CSO80 and
EVK00 tables (adjusted by 50%) are used for Turkey.

The defined benefit plans for employee termination payments are in accordance with Turkish social
legislation, Italian TFR legislation and Austrian severance legislation (Abfertigungsrückstellung). The benefits of
the plans in Austria and Turkey are dependent on the final salary and respective length of service. The benefits of
the Italian plan are dependent on salary.

The German defined benefit plan considers only one retired person. Therefore the expected wage and salary
trends for Germany are 0% and are agreed on an individual basis.

For financial instruments with current maturities including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
payable as well as other receivables and payables it is assumed that their carrying amounts approximate their fair
values.

The fair values of non-current financial instruments are calculated as the present values of the estimated future
cash flows using market interest rates for discounting.

The fair values of non-current financial liabilities with variable interest rates are estimated to be equal to their
carrying amounts since the interest rates agreed and those available on the market do not significantly differ.

The following table provides the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Group’s non-current assets and
liabilities.

The different hierarchy levels have been defined as follows:

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the
measurement date. A quoted market price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value
and is used without adjustment to measure fair value whenever available, with limited exceptions.

Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in
active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs
other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and inputs that are derived principally from
or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (‘market-corroborated inputs’).

Level 3 inputs inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are used to measure
fair value to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which
there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. An entity develops
unobservable inputs using the best information available in the circumstances, which might include the entity’s
own data, taking into account all information about market participant assumptions that is reasonably available.

The Group’s policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of fair value hierarchy levels as at the end of
the reporting period. There have been no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during 2012 and 2013.

Total management remuneration for 2012 amounted to KEUR 3,803.

10 Share-based payment

Executive managers working within the Group were allowed to buy shares indirectly as Limited Partners of a socalled Partnership.

If and to the extent that a manager ceases his employment before the occurrence of an exit event (so-called leaver
event), the executive manager grants the General Partner of the Partnership the right to purchase and acquire all
of his shares (leaver shares). The purchase price for the leaver shares will be determined, depending on the
reasons for and time of leaving, as the higher or lower of the fair market value of the leaver shares or the cost of
investment plus interest on these equity instruments.

As the reporting entity has no obligation to settle the entitlements at any time (neither in case of an exit nor in
case of a leaver event), the award is accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transaction according to
IFRS 2. Since the executive managers had to pay the fair market value of the shares in course of the accession, no
quantifiable benefits were granted. Therefore, no expenses have to be recognised at any time.

**IFRS consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2013**
**Wittur International Holding GmbH**

The following auditor’s report (Besta¨tigungsvermerk) has been issued in accordance with Section 322 of the
German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) on the consolidated financial statements and group management
report (Konzernlagebericht) of Wittur International Holding GmbH as of and for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2013. The group management report is neither included nor incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum.

**Auditor’s Report**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Wittur International Holding GmbH,
Wiedenzhausen, comprising the balance sheet, the statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in
equity, cash flow statement and the notes to the consolidated financial statements, together with the group
management report for the business year from January 1 to December 31, 2013. The preparation of the
consolidated financial statements and the group management report in accordance with the IFRSs, as adopted by
the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § (Article) 315a Abs.
(paragraph) 1 HGB (“Handelsgesetzbuch”: German Commercial Code) is the responsibility of the parent
Company’s Managing Directors. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements and on the group management report based on our audit.

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 317 HGB and German
generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der
Wirtschaftspru¨fer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany) (IDW). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net assets, financial
position and results of operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the applicable
financial reporting framework and in the group management report are detected with reasonable assurance.
Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the Group and expectations as
to possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness of
the accounting-related internal control system and the evidence supporting the disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements and the group management report are examined primarily on a test basis within the
framework of the audit. The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements of those entities included in
consolidation, the determination of the entities to be included in consolidation, the accounting and consolidation
principles used and significant estimates made by the Company’s Managing Directors, as well as evaluating the
overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Our audit has not led to any reservations.

In our opinion based on the findings of our audit the consolidated financial statements comply with the IFRSs as
adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315a Abs. 1 HGB
and give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group in
accordance with these requirements. The group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial
statements and as a whole provides a suitable view of the Group’s position and suitably presents the
opportunities and risks of future development.

We issue this opinion on the basis of our duty-bound audit of the financial statements concluded as of March 19,
2014, and our supplementary audit referring to the changes to the disclosure of the maturity structure of warranty
provisions, to disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements concerning pension provisions and
the ultimate controlling party as well as additional disclosures with respect to IFRS 7 and management
remuneration for 2012. We refer to the enterprise’s reasons for the changes as stated in the changed notes to the
financial statements, section 1.2. The supplementary audit did not lead to any reservations.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Financial Year**
**from January 1 through December 31, 2012 (continued)**

In accordance with Section 296 (2) HGB, the following indirect equity investments are not fully consolidated,
but rather are stated at acquisition costs or at the lower fair value, since they are of minor importance in terms of
providing a true and fair view of the Group’s net assets, financial positions and results of operations.

Equity Net income/

2001 through December 31, 2001; inactive) 29.92 -161,065.02 72,081.66

In financial year 2012, the companies Wittur Reorganisation GmbH, Munich, and Wittur IT Holding s.r.l., Italy,
ceased to exist as a result of intra-Group mergers.

LLeca S.A., Buenos Aires, Argentina was liquidated in financial year 2012.

Capital Consolidation

Capital consolidation is carried out in accordance with Section 301 (1 + 2) HGB (revaluation method).
Accordingly, the carrying amounts of the investments are offset against the Group’s share in the equity capital of
the consolidated subsidiaries at the time of their first-time inclusion in the consolidated financial statements.

Provisions are stated pursuant to Section 253 (1) Clauses 2 and 3 as well as Section 253 (3) HGB, while deferred
taxes are valued in accordance with Section 274 HGB.

Assets-side differences are initially allocated - in full or in part - to the assets of the individual subsidiaries. Any
remaining assets-side differences are reported as goodwill and are amortized over a period of five years using the
straight-line method pursuant to Section 309 (1) HGB in conjunction with Section 253 (3) HGB
(cf. Section D.I.1).

Debt Consolidation

All loans and other receivables, provisions and liabilities arising between the companies included in the
consolidated financial statements were offset against each other. Differences arising from valuation allowances
for and discounting of Group receivables, from differences in the measurement of receivables and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies (lower/higher of cost or market principle respecting amounts denominated in
foreign currency with residual terms of more than one year), and from provisions for intra-Group risks have been
offset in profit and loss. Contingent liabilities are eliminated in the same way.

Consolidation Measures in the Income Statement

Sales revenues and other revenues from the supplying of goods and services between the companies included in
the consolidated financial statements are offset in the consolidated income statement against the respective
expenses attributable to them.

Elimination of intra-Group Results

Intra-Group results from the sale of tangible assets within the Group are eliminated in case of materiality.
Inventories from supplies provided by consolidated Group companies that are to be included in the consolidated
financial statements are stated at their intra-Group acquisition or manufacturing costs. The intra-Group results
arising in this context are eliminated.

Currency Translation

In accordance with Section 308a HGB, the modified closing rate method is used for foreign currency translation
of the individual local financial statements denominated in foreign currency. In this context, the asset and

F-83


-----

**Wittur International Holding GmbH, Wiedenzhausen**

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Financial Year**
**from January 1 through December 31, 2012 (continued)**

liability items stated in a consolidated subsidiary’s balance sheet denominated in a foreign currency are translated
at the spot exchange middle rate applicable as of the balance sheet date, except for shareholders’ equity, which is
translated into euros using historical rates. The items stated in the income statement are translated into euros
using average rates. Any translation differences are reported under consolidated shareholders’ equity as
shareholders’ capital difference from currency translation.

Period Allocation of Deferred Taxes

The tax deferrals recorded in the consolidated financial statements for deferred taxes concern temporary
differences that are expected to reverse in future financial years.

They result from the commercial valuation of assets, liabilities and deferred items and their tax-based valuation
in the individual balance sheets of the consolidated companies pursuant to Section 274 HGB and from adjusting
the individual local financial statements included in the consolidated financial statements to the Group’s uniform
accounting and valuation, and from consolidation in the consolidated balance sheet pursuant to
Section 306 HGB.

The valid tax rates applicable in the respective countries are used for determining the tax deferrals. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are not netted.

Deferred items pursuant to Sections 274 and 306 HGB are combined in accordance with Section 306 Clause 6
HGB.

C. Accounting and Valuation Principles

Accounting and valuation is based on the provisions stipulated in the German Commercial Code (HGB)
respecting large corporations and on the uniform accounting and valuation principles of the Parent Company.

The realization and imparity principles are being observed; assets are stated no higher than their acquisition or
manufacturing costs. It is only with respect to receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies which
have a residual term of up to one year that the acquisition costs and the realization principle pursuant to
Section 256 a Clause 2 HGB are not observed.

Acquired intangible assets are stated at cost and, to the extent depreciable, are amortized over their expected
useful lives net of scheduled amortization or are written down to the expected permanent lower fair value.

The Company makes use of the option provided for under Section 248 (2) HGB to capitalize internally generated
intangible assets. The internally generated intangible assets are reported at manufacturing cost and are amortized
over the anticipated useful life net of scheduled amortization or written down to the expected permanent lower
fair value. Total research and development costs are shown in the notes to the consolidated financial statements
under Section D.I.2.

Tangible assets are stated at acquisition or manufacturing costs and, to the extent depreciable, are depreciated net
of scheduled depreciation or are written down to the expected permanent lower fair value.

Financial assets are reported at acquisition cost or at the permanent lower fair value.

The tangible assets are depreciated over their expected useful lives on a straight-line basis or are written down to
the expected permanent lower fair value. As a general rule, additions to property, plant and equipment are
depreciated on a prorated basis. Low value items of up to EUR 410.00 are fully written down in the year of
addition.

Raw materials and supplies are stated at cost or the lower fair value; the lower fair values are mainly determined
on the basis of the conditions prevailing in the procurement market, while also accounting for the possible use of
the inventories.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Financial Year**
**from January 1 through December 31, 2012 (continued)**

Write-downs for inventory risks resulting from the period of storage and reduced recoverability are recorded to
an adequate and sufficient extent.

Finished goods and work in progress are stated at manufacturing costs. The manufacturing costs comprise
production materials, direct labor costs, cost of materials, manufacturing overhead costs as well as appropriate,
proportionate administrative overheads. Sufficient write-downs that were updated in this financial year were
recorded with regard to slow moving and technically outdated goods. The goods were measured without loss in
accordance with the conditions prevailing in the sales market.

Merchandise is reported at cost or the lower market prices.

Receivables and other assets are stated at nominal value. Adequate individual value adjustments have been
recorded for all items that are subject to risk; general valuation allowances that were updated in this financial
year were set up to account for the general credit risk.

Bank balances are recognized at nominal value or the lower fair value.

Prepaid expenses include payments made for circumstances that will first be reported as expenses in the
following years.

The projected unit credit method was used for the valuation of pension provisions. The expected wage and salary
trends for Germany stand at 0%, since only one person that is retired is concerned in this context. The
assumptions listed in the following Table served as the basis of calculation:

**Salary**
**trend** **Mortality table** **Inflation rate** **Interest rate**
Wittur GmbH, Austria 2.5% 2005 G Mortality — 5.06%
Wittur Deutschland Holding GmbH Tables of Klaus Heubeck 2005 G
0% Mortality — 5.06%
Wittur S.p.A., Italy Tables of Klaus Heubeck RG48
0% (official Italian mortality tables) 2.0% 5.06%
Wittur Hydraulic Drives s.r.l., Italy 0% 2.0% 5.06%
Wittur B.V., Netherlands 0% Forecast table 2010 – 2060 — 5.06%
Wittur Asansör Sa- nayi ve Ticaret,
Ltd.Sti., Turkey 3.0% Evk00 5.62% 7.92%

The discount rate of 5.06% used as of December 31, 2012 corresponds to the discount rate published by the
German Federal Reserve Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank) for obligations with a residual maturity of 15 years
pursuant to the Regulation on the Discounting of Provisions (Rückstellungsabzinsungsverordnung –
RückAbzinsV). The Company thus made use of the relief provisions for provisions concerning pension
obligations pursuant to Section 253 (2) Clause 2 HGB, as permitted by law.

Other provisions take into account all recognizable risks and uncertain liabilities as well as anticipated losses
from pending transactions. The provisions were stated at the settlement amounts – including price and cost
increases – required by sound business judgment to meet future payment obligations. Long-term provisions were
discounted on the basis of the average market interest rate of the past seven years in accordance with their
respective residual term.

Liabilities are stated at the respective settlement amount.

Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies with a residual term of up to one year are recognized at
the spot exchange middle rates applicable as of the balance sheet date. Assets and liabilities with a residual term
of more than one year are stated at the exchange rate applicable on the date of their occurrence, unless a
depreciated or appreciated exchange rate at the balance sheet date requires that receivables be written down or
that a higher valuation be applied with regard to liabilities, respectively.

Liabilities arising from deferred compensation that constitute long-term liabilities similar to pension
obligations have been offset against assets that exclusively serve the purpose of meeting such pension obligations

and which represent plan assets within the meaning of Section 246 (2) Clause 2 HGB. In accordance with a
confirmation, the netted present value of the plan assets amounts to EUR 2,690,715.86 as of December 31, 2012
(2011: KEUR 2,218). The acquisition costs of the plan asset stood at EUR 2,690,715.86 as of December 31, 2012
(2011: KEUR 2,218). Accordingly, the respective settlement amount corresponded to the plan assets’ present
value. The netted expenses and income amounted to EUR 69,943.05 in financial year 2012 (2011: KEUR 52).

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are used at Wittur to limit risks from changes in interest rates. Since no
valuation unit has been formed for these derivative financial instruments, the reporting is done on the basis of the
imparity principle, which means that provisions are created for negative market values; while positive market
values are not reported.

For acquired options, the entire option premium is capitalized as an asset and is subject to the strict lower of price
or market value principle for reporting on the balance sheet date. A liability is recognized for still outstanding
option premiums.

The market value is calculated on the basis of the market data applicable on the balance sheet date with the aid of
the recognized option price models (for interest options) and by discounting anticipated future cash flows over
the remaining term (for interest rate swaps).

3. Receivables and Other Assets

The asset value of the Employers’ Pension Liability Insurance in the amount of KEUR 2,691 (2011:
KEUR 2,218), which was netted with the liabilities arising from deferred compensation, has a term of more than
one year as of December 31, 2012.

In total, there are receivables in the amount of KEUR 7,291 which have a residual term of more than one year as
of December 31, 2012 (2011: KEUR 6,991).

4. Provisions

The provisions item is structured as follows:

**2012** 2011
**KEUR** KEUR
Pension provisions **1,242** 1,253
Severance payment provisions **6,887** 6,289
Tax provisions **4,544** 6,609
Other provisions **23,072** 17,078

Total provisions **35,745** 31,229

Other provisions are mainly comprised of provisions for vacations, other personnel- related provisions and
provisions for warranty commitments.

5. Deferred Taxes

The consolidated financial statements contain deferred taxes that are attributable to temporary differences
between the commercial and the tax accounts (2011: deferred tax assets in the amount of KEUR 5,088 and
deferred tax liabilities amounting to KEUR 25,716). They are composed of the following:

Deferred Deferred
tax tax
assets liabilities
KEUR KEUR

- Individual local financial statements included in the consolidated financial statements (HB I) 3,342 335

- Adjustments to the Group’s uniform accounting and valuation (HB II) 4,929 21,169
Total 8,264 21,504

The significant temporary differences between the commercial and the tax balance sheet that result in deferred
tax assets concern provisions and value adjustments in Turkey that need not be taken into account for tax
purposes and severance payment provisions at Wittur GmbH in Austria that are not tax-deductible. The
significant deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2012 are due to the disclosure of hidden reserves during the
initial consolidation, which accounts for deferred tax liabilities in the amount of EUR 19.0 million, and to
differences in the depreciation/amortization regulations concerning commercial law and tax law. The hidden
reserves, in turn, are comprised of the revaluation of tangible assets and inventories, the valuation of the
customer base and brand rights, and, to a smaller extent, of the knowledge on the technologies employed.

In total, carry-over losses of KEUR 27,491 (2011: KEUR 20,109) were classified as not recoverable and
therefore not reported as deferred tax assets.

The local tax rates used for the calculation of the deferred taxes are between 10% and 35%.

The following auditor’s report (Besta¨tigungsvermerk) has been issued in accordance with Section 322 of the
German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) on the consolidated financial statements and group management
report (Konzernlagebericht) of Wittur International Holding GmbH as of and for the fiscal year ended December

memorandum.

**Auditor’s Report**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Wittur International Holding GmbH,
Wiedenzhausen, comprising the balance sheet, the income statement, the notes to the consolidated financial
statements, cash flow statement and statement of changes in equity, together with the group management report
for the business year from January 1 to December 31, 2012. The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements and the group management report in accordance with German commercial law is the responsibility of
the parent Company’s Managing Directors. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements and the group management report based on our audit.

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § (Article) 317 HGB
(“Handelsgesetzbuch”: “German Commercial Code”) and German generally accepted standards for the audit of
financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspru¨fer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany)
(IDW). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting
the presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with (German) principles of proper accounting and in the group management report are
detected with reasonable assurance. Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal
environment of the Group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account in the
determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system and the
evidence supporting the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the group management report are
examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit. The audit includes assessing the annual
financial statements of the companies included in consolidation, the determination of the companies to be
included in consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles used and significant estimates made by the
Company’s Managing Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
statements and the group management report. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

Our audit has not led to any reservations.

In our opinion based on the findings of our audit, the consolidated financial statements comply with the legal
requirements and give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the
Group in accordance with (German) principles of proper accounting. The group management report is consistent
with the consolidated financial statements and as a whole provides a suitable view of the Group’s position and
suitably presents the opportunities and risks of future development.
