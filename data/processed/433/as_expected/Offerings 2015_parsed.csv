By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on numerous assumptions and that our actual results of operations, including our financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate, may differ materially from (and be more negative than) those made in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, even if our results of operations, including our financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.

In this Offering Memorandum, the terms “financial statements” and “financial information” refer to the financial statements and the financial information of the Wittur Group.

This data has been prepared solely for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum, is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting and has not been audited or reviewed. Our income statement for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2012 included in our 2012 Audited Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis of German GAAP, using the “nature of expense” method. Our income statements included in our 2013 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis of IFRS, using the “cost of sales” method. In the nature of expense method, expenses are classified in the income statement according to their nature (for example, cost of materials and personnel expenses) and not among various functions within the entity (for example, cost of sales). As a result, income statements presented in accordance with the nature of expense method do not show gross profit. Income statements presented in accordance with the cost of sales method, by contrast, classify expenses according to their function as part of cost of sales, the costs of distribution or administrative activities. Profit, however, is unaffected regardless of whether the nature of expense or cost of sales method is chosen. The Issuer was formed on December 19, 2014 for the purpose of facilitating the Transactions. The Issuer does not have any business operations or material assets or liabilities other than those incurred in connection with its incorporation and the Transactions. Consequently, limited historical financial information relating to the Issuer is available, and no financial information with respect to the Issuer is included in this Offering Memorandum, except for certain limited as adjusted financial data presented on a consolidated basis as adjusted to reflect certain effects of the Transactions and the Offering. All historical financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum is that of the Target and its subsidiaries; accordingly, all references to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Group” in respect of historical financial information in this Offering Memorandum are to the Target and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. xiv ----- In the future, we will report our financial results at the level of the Issuer, on a consolidated basis. The Issuer will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS, which will affect the comparability of the Issuer’s future consolidated financial statements. The financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum are those of the Wittur Group and have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the income statement, balance sheet or cash flow statement that might occur as a result of application of purchase accounting adjustments to be applied as a result of the Acquisition, nor have they been adjusted to reflect the impact of any changes to the balance sheet as a result of any limitation on our ability to use certain net operating loss carry forwards for tax purposes following the Acquisition. We expect that the carrying value for certain deferred tax assets on our balance sheet will be reduced upon consummation of the Acquisition as a result of these limitations. In addition, the application of purchase accounting could result in different carrying values for existing assets and assets we may add to our balance sheet, which may include intangible assets, such as goodwill, and different amortization and depreciation expenses, which could be significant. Our financial statements could be materially different from the financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum once the adjustments are made. If the Offering were registered under the U.S. Securities Act, we would be required to present pro forma financial statements to reflect such adjustments and the impact of the Transactions, but no pro forma financial statements are presented in this Offering Memorandum. The Acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Under IFRS 3 “Business Combinations,” the cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the acquirer, including the fair value of any asset or liability incurred and the equity interests issued by the acquirer, including the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair market values at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value if the acquirer’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Since the Acquisition has not been consummated as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have not identified the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities to be assumed at the date of the Acquisition. In accordance with IFRS, we have up to twelve months from the Completion Date to finalize the allocation of the purchase price.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Our 2013 Audited Financial Statements include a reconciliation of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 from German GAAP to IFRS. However, no such reconciliation is available for our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011, which are based on German GAAP and we cannot estimate the net effect that applying IFRS would have had on our results of operations or our financial position for the year ended December 31, 2011. The effect of such differences might be material, and, in particular, total shareholders’ equity (capital debit), gross profit and net income prepared on the basis of IFRS may be materially different. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Differences between German GAAP and IFRS.” In addition, IFRS and German GAAP differ in certain material respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). As a result, the results of operations and financial condition derived from the financial statements that are included in this Offering Memorandum may differ substantially from the results of operations and financial condition derived from financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures under IFRS as set forth in our financial statements. Some of these limitations of non-GAAP measures are: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated income statement; - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, the non-GAAP measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.

433,Offerings 2015.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are the world’s leading independent elevator components manufacturer. The elevator components industry is characterized by long-term growth and resilience during economic downturns due to a number of favorable factors. Demand for elevators has grown significantly faster than GDP due to a number of favorable global trends, such as population growth, urbanization, taller buildings, aging populations, increased wealth and increased regulation and safety awareness. As a manufacturer of elevator components operating independently from elevator installers, we also benefit from the trend of elevator installers increasingly seeking to outsource the manufacture of components, which has increased the rate of growth for elevator components manufacturers above the growth in demand for elevators. Our position as the leading independent elevator components manufacturer has enabled us to capitalize on these growth trends, as evidenced by our strong long-term revenue growth and EBITDA margins in excess of 10% on average since 2004. We are a global manufacturer of elevator components with a strong footprint across multiple regions. We divide our operations into three geographical regions which include Europe, Asia and the Rest of the World. Our Europe region includes our operations in Africa and represents our core market, accounting for 48.6% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2013, with upside potential as Southern European economies recover. Our Asia region provides the growth engine for our business, with 37.4% of our revenue, driven by increased urbanization and other favorable trends in China, and with the potential to grow spare parts sales in China as the market matures. Our Rest of the World region primarily includes Eurasia, Turkey, the Middle East and Latin America and represented 13.9% of our revenue, with the potential for significant future growth. Our product offering features a large range of elevator components for new elevator manufacturing and sourcing, for spare parts and for modernization and upgrades. Our components span from sophisticated mechatronic components for elevator cabin and landing doors (including the associated opening mechanisms) to other critical components such as gearless drives, slings, safety gears and cars. We also offer complete elevators, which we primarily sell to independent elevator installers (“Independents”). Sales of doors and door components accounted for 69% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2013. Doors and door components are required at each floor of a building, so as the average height of new buildings increases, the demand for elevator doors and door components also increases at a faster rate than demand for other components. Doors and door components range from relatively standardized, high-volume production doors to highly customized, special-order doors—we offer 19 models of landing doors and 15 models of elevator car doors. Having produced approximately 1.2 million doors and door components in the year ended December 31, 2013, we believe we are the leading elevator door and door components supplier in a highly fragmented elevator components market. We manufacture components for both the original equipment market and the aftermarket. We estimate that the original equipment market makes up a larger percentage of our business in developing countries, such as China, while the aftermarket makes up approximately 50% of our sales in a mature market such as Europe. Aftermarket sales range from routine provision of spare parts through the lifetime of an elevator, to components for modernization and upgrade of an elevator, to complete replacement of an elevator. In developing markets such as China, we expect aftermarket components sales to strongly increase as the life cycle of newly-installed elevators progresses. Our key customers are global, multinational corporation elevator installers (“MNCs”), such as westernbased MNCs Kone, Otis, Schindler and ThyssenKrupp Elevator (“Western MNCs”) and Asian-based MNCs Fujitec, Hitachi, Hyundai, Mitsubishi Electric and Toshiba (“Asian MNCs”), as well as Independents, which are 1 ----- typically active in a limited geographic market. In the year ended December 31, 2013, Western MNCs accounted for approximately 68% of our revenue, Independents for approximately 32% of our revenue and Asian MNCs for less than 1% of our revenue. We have deeply-ingrained, mutually-dependent relationships with a number of our key customers, and benefit from multi-year, guaranteed “share-of-wallet” contracts with a number of our key customers, allowing us to share in the growth of our customers’ business. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we generated revenue of €501.4 million and Historic Adjusted EBITDA of €72.7 million. As of September 30, 2014, we had a work force of 3,206 employees and conducted business in more than 50 countries.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442
433,Offerings 2015.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.1,Leading global position,"We are the world’s largest independent elevator component manufacturer, with unparalleled breadth and scale across products and regions. We estimate that we generate more than two times the revenue of our next largest competitor. We manufacture and sell a broad range of critical and technologically complex components throughout the world. In contrast, most of our competitors are suppliers that focus on a narrow range of products and specific regions. Our size and global footprint translate into a number of competitive advantages, including (i) purchasing power economies of scale, (ii) the capacity to meet our customers’ volume requirements throughout the world, (iii) the resources to manage complex global safety regulations and certification processes and to undertake market-leading global research and development, (iv) the ability to deliver globally-consistent, high levels of quality to our customers and (v) the ability to attract the most skilled talent in our industry. Because of our leading position, we believe we are often MNCs’ trusted partner of choice for their most complex projects, including high-visibility projects such as Apple store glass elevators, large hotels and marine facilities, cruise and cargo ships and offshore oil platforms. Our long and successful track record in projects such as these provides us with an advantage when our customers are making purchase decisions, thereby allowing us to grow as the elevator installation industry grows, and to benefit from the same favorable trends.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442
433,Offerings 2015.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.2,Strong and resilient market dynamics supporting multiple levers of growth,"The elevator and elevator components market has experienced significant growth, with growth in demand for elevators estimated to have grown by a CAGR of 9.5% from 1996 to 2012, significantly outpacing global GDP growth. This has been the result of a number of favorable global trends which we expect to continue, including population growth, urbanization, taller buildings, aging populations, increased wealth and increased regulation and safety awareness. Demand for elevator components is driven by new installations, as well as the need for the modernization and maintenance of the installed base. New installations grow most quickly in developing markets, such as China, while mature markets, such as those in Europe, have a greater focus on modernization, maintenance and spare parts. As developing markets mature, we expect the aftermarket for modernization, maintenance and spare parts in such markets to grow. We also benefit from the trend of outsourcing, whereby elevator installers choose to outsource the manufacturing of elevator components, which has increased in recent years, allowing elevator component manufacturers to grow more quickly than demand for elevators. The elevator components industry lags behind the automotive industry (which itself continues to increase the rate of outsourcing of components manufacturing) in terms of share of components outsourced, and we expect the elevator components industry to follow the same trend. These favorable industry trends have driven our growth.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Our revenue has grown by a CAGR of 7% from 2004 to 2014 and, excluding 2009 to 2010, we grew our revenues by over 10% per year on average. Our EBITDA margin has exceeded 10% on average in each year since 2004. Even during the 2009 to 2010 economic downturn our revenues only declined by 10-15%, and benefiting from our relatively flexible cost structure and capital expenditure profile, we maintained EBITDA 2 ----- margins in excess of 10% through strict cost management. By 2011, we were able to surpass our pre-crisis level revenue and EBITDA. Despite weak new housing starts in China in 2014, our business in China continued to exhibit strong growth throughout the year with a further acceleration in the fourth quarter, and healthy order book levels for us and our key customers at the end of the year. Our growth over the last ten years has coincided with that of our Western MNC customers, and they have also experienced margin improvement, underscoring the overall attractiveness of the industry. We are a highly cash generative business with relatively low levels of capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the manufacturing industry, and had Cash Conversion of 82.7% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014. Our global production footprint provides us a natural hedge against currency, pricing and other local risks.

433,Offerings 2015.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.4,"Strong, long-standing relationships with leading MNCs","We are a trusted supplier to the largest international elevator companies in the world. Our largest customers include many of the world’s most significant elevator companies, such as Kone, Schindler, Otis and ThyssenKrupp Elevator, who together accounted for approximately 43% of total revenue in the elevator industry in the year ended December 31, 2013. We derived approximately two-thirds of our revenue from these four customers in the year ended December 31, 2013. We have long-standing relationships with each of these customers, which we have maintained over the past 15 to 30 years. These long-standing relationships have allowed us to better understand our customers’ needs and priorities, thereby enabling us to cater to our customers from conception, design and development to manufacturing and distribution of components to offering comprehensive after-sale services and technical support. MNCs put substantial efforts in long-term product standardization in order to simplify and reduce complexity in the maintenance and breakdown service process. In addition, elevator certification and safety regulations mean that changing components suppliers can add additional compliance costs. For these reasons, elevator installers prefer to remain with selected components and suppliers. Doing so reduces failure rates and maintenance cost, improves productivity and minimizes safety risks. The result has been that our MNC customers engage with us to deliver on their most complex and important projects, and rely on us as their partner of choice in a manner that would be difficult for a competitor to replicate. Our close relationships with our key Western MNC customers are also demonstrated by our multi-year agreements under which our largest customers have agreed to purchase a certain percentage of their requirements for certain components from us (“share-of-wallet” agreements). We also see an opportunity to expand business with Asian MNCs, using our close relationships with Western MNCs as a model, particularly as safety regulations become more stringent in emerging markets to the benefit of established, high-quality component manufacturers such as us.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442
433,Offerings 2015.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strengths,9.2.5,Strong relationships with Independents,"We also have strong, long-standing relationships with Independents, who are generally regional elevator installers. In the year ended December 31, 2013, sales to Independents constituted approximately 32% of our revenue. Independents accounted for approximately 39% of total revenue in the elevator industry in 2013, typically require more individualized solutions than MNCs and outsource to a greater degree than MNCs. We have a full-service offering for Independents that caters to their needs, including offering complete elevators and spare parts and comprehensive support services for our components. As a result, sales to Independents typically generate higher gross profit margins than those to MNCs.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

The share of our business constituting new installations compared to modernizations, upgrades and maintenance spare parts varies by region, depending on the age of the installed base of elevators compared to the pace of new installation. For example, we estimate that new installations constitute approximately 50% of our sales in mature markets such as Europe, but 90% of our sales in emerging markets, such as China. Our ability to service both the new installation market and the aftermarket allows us to benefit from economic growth and emerging markets, while also giving us downside protection and steady sales in mature markets.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

We also systematically analyze competitor products to improve our own products. Furthermore, existing test towers in Austria, China, Germany and Spain (currently under construction), also give us a key advantage as an independent component manufacturer. We have seven 3 ----- R&D centers that focus on performance improvements, weight reduction, energy efficiency, reliability, maintenance reduction, installation speed and adjustability to new industry norms. We also hold more than 300 patents. We also cooperate with major universities, providing us access to innovative new technologies at an early stage. In addition, we have established a close interlink between our R&D department and our product certification team, thereby ensuring not only a short lead time for required certifications for new product innovations, but also allowing for quick responses to new regulatory standards.

During the last two-and-a-half years, under the leadership of our management team, we have begun implementing processes throughout our organization in an effort to drive such continuous improvement. Some of the most significant operational improvements include rationalization of certain of our operations, relocating production to lower-cost jurisdictions and improving internal controls. But we are also taking more extensive improvements that reach deep into our organization, and cover all relevant functions, from sales to purchasing, production, R&D and also include support functions such as finance and human resources. Through these improvements, we have incentivized individual management to drive growth. We believe the improvements achieved through these new processes are significant, particularly in relation to production processes. Our production process improvements focus on improving our quality management systems and achieving our zero accidents objective. We also are working to improve our delivery performance and improve the quality of the suppliers from which we source materials. We intend to improve our key account outreach and sales with Asian MNCs, and we also intend to continue to update and modernize our product range. We are also focused on optimizing our electronic integration with our key account management teams.

This close relationship means that as our MNC customers grow, we plan to grow as well. In particular, we intend to grow with Kone, but also to continue to diversify our customer base by further developing our relationships with other MNCs. For example, we recently entered into binding, multi-year “share-of-wallet” agreements with Schindler, as well as with Kone. We are also in active dialogue with other MNCs, including Asian MNCs, who have historically outsourced less of their elevator components demand than Western MNCs, and intend to more substantially diversify our 4 ----- customer mix by developing relationships with other Western MNCs. Over the past twelve months, we have received an increasing number of requests for quotes for new business from Asian MNCs, validating this strategy. As part of our continuous improvement strategy, we have focused on optimizing our key account management teams and strengthening our regional sales teams across all regions and have prioritized R&D to develop our available products and retain our competitive position in the market.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

We see potential to grow our business with Independents, and are working to improve our sales forces’ focus on such customers. We focus on sales of spare parts via a business-to-business platform to grow our business with Independents. We believe that increasing regulatory requirements, particularly in developing markets, will enable us to grow our business with Independents who typically require fully certified packages or complete elevators, and that Independents will increasingly seek out established, high-quality component manufacturers such as ourselves to help them meet more stringent requirements. We also believe that a focus on Independents will help us continue our geographic expansion.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442
433,Offerings 2015.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategy,9.3.4,Further geographic expansion,"We believe that significant opportunities for our business exist in certain developing markets where we have not historically focused our operations. In particular, we see opportunities in Eurasia, Latin America and India and Southeast Asia. In Eurasia, which made up approximately 5% of all new elevator installations in 2013, we intend to grow in line with the rapidly-growing market by winning business with the MNCs and further penetrating Independents. In Latin America, we intend to grow our business on the back of strong end market growth and to benefit from our new plant in Brazil. In India, which made up approximately 5% of all new elevator installations in 2013, and in Southeast Asia, we see attractive, growth driven end-markets for elevator components, and the opportunity to sell to both MNCs and Independents operating in those markets. Our view is that these markets are on the cusp of a strong phase of growth in demand for elevators, akin to that in China in recent years. To exploit these opportunities, we have increased our sales forces in these regions and are working to increase local market penetration, so we already have a strong base by which we will be able to quickly respond to growing demand. We also intend to continue to utilize our strategy of locating our plants in low cost countries where we benefit from labor cost efficiencies and close proximity to customers. We also are investigating entry into the North American market. While we expect most of our growth to be organic, we may also opportunistically undertake accretive acquisitions in the highly fragmented elevator components market.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

At present, approximately 90% of our sales in emerging markets are for new elevator installations. However, as the lifecycles of the elevators installed in these markets in recent years progress over time, we expect demand for modernization, maintenance and spare parts to grow to be similar to those in more mature markets, such as Europe, where sales of components for modernization, maintenance and spare parts constitute approximately 50% of our sales.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Interest on the Notes will accrue from the Issue Date. Form of Denomination . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be issued in global form in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, maintained in book-entry form. Ranking of the Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will: - be senior obligations of the Issuer; - be secured as set forth under “—Security;” - rank pari passu in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s existing and future senior indebtedness; - be senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; - rank effectively senior to the existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is unsecured to the extent of the value of the Collateral; - be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes; and - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future debt of the Issuer and its subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets which do not secure the Notes or which secure such other debt on a senior-priority basis, including the Senior Facilities, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such debt. Guarantees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be guaranteed within 90 days of the Completion Date on a senior subordinated basis by the Guarantors, other than BidCo, which will guarantee the Notes on the Issue Date. The obligations of each Guarantor will be limited as described under the heading “Description of the Notes—The Notes Guarantees.” Each Guarantee will be subject to certain contractual and legal limitations. For example, the Guarantees by our Italian subsidiaries, Wittur Italia Holding s.r.l. and Wittur S.p.A., are expected to be limited to €5.0 million and €1.0 million, respectively (based on a Completion Date of March 31, 2015). The limitation of the Italian Guarantees will be calculated as a percentage of the intercompany 10 ----- proceeds loans used to refinance existing indebtedness of our Italian subsidiaries and could be higher or lower, depending on the amount of outstanding local debt on the actual Completion Date. In addition, the Guarantee provided by Wittur Asanso¨r San. V Tic. A.S., our subsidiary in Turkey, will be capped at €2.5 million. However, we cannot provide any assurances that holders of the Notes will be able to recover even these amounts under such Guarantees, as payment under each Guarantee is contractually subordinated to all the senior indebtedness of such Guarantor, including such Guarantor’s obligations under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations. See “Certain Limitations on the Validity and the Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” Ranking of the Guarantees . . . . . . . . . .** Each Guarantee will: - be a senior subordinated obligation of the applicable Guarantor; - be secured as set forth under “—Security;” - be subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior indebtedness of such Guarantor, including the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations; - rank pari passu in right of payment to all existing and future senior subordinated obligations of such Guarantor; - be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes; and - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future debt of the Issuer and its subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets which do not secure the Notes, including the Senior Facilities, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such debt. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, the Guarantors (excluding BidCo) accounted for 64% of our consolidated gross assets (excluding goodwill and certain other intangible assets resulting from the purchase price allocation of our acquisition by Triton in 2010 which cannot be allocated to individual subsidiaries), 50% of our consolidated net sales and 60% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Group (in each case, excluding BidCo). The Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” The Guarantees will be subject to release under certain circumstances. See “Description of the Notes—The Notes Guarantees—Notes Guarantees Release.” Security . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Subject to certain agreed security principles and certain perfection requirements, on the Issue Date or within five business days thereof, the Notes and the Guarantees (upon the granting thereof by the respective Guarantors) will be secured: (i) on a first-priority basis, by the Notes Collateral consisting of: - the Escrow Charge (which will be in place on the Issue Date); - a pledge of the shares of the Issuer; and - a pledge of the bank accounts of the Issuer; and 11 ----- (ii) on a second-priority basis pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement to obligations under the Senior Facilities, by the Shared Collateral; consisting of: - a pledge of the shares of BidCo; - a security interest in respect of the Proceeds Loan; - a pledge of the bank accounts of BidCo; and - an assignment of BidCo’s claims under the Acquisition Agreement. The Shared Collateral will secure obligations under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations on a first-priority basis. Lenders under the Senior Facilities will receive priority to the proceeds from the Collateral in the event of any enforcement. See “Description of the Notes—Security.” The Collateral will be subject to contractual and legal limitations and may be released under certain circumstances. See “Certain Limitations on the Validity and the Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.” No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this Offering. By its nature, some of or all the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure. Intercreditor Agreement . . . . . . . . . . . .** The indebtedness and obligations under the Notes and the Senior Facilities and certain other existing and future indebtedness and obligations permitted under the Indenture governing the Notes will be secured by liens on the Collateral. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, however, in the event of enforcement of the Shared Collateral, the holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from the Shared Collateral only after the lenders under the Senior Facilities have been repaid in full. Moreover, the holders of the Notes will be subject to certain limitations on their ability to take certain actions in respect of the security interests in the Collateral, including certain standstill periods See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Differences between German GAAP and IFRS.” As used for the period ended December 31, 2011, the term revenues refer to sales, the term total capital expenditure refers to payments made for investments in tangible assets and intangible assets and the term change in working capital refers to the decrease in inventories, trade receivables and other assets that are not allocable to investing or financing activities less the increase in trade payables and other liabilities that are not allocable to investing or financing activities, in each case as defined under German GAAP. Amounts presented under the column for the year ended December 31, 2011 have not been prepared on a comparable basis to the other amounts presented. (**) Audited financial information. Revenues by region for the year ended December 31, 2011 have been regrouped to match our present revenue split and include sales deductions. Therefore, the revenues by region for the year ended December 31, 2011, deviate from our 2012 Audited Financial Statements in which revenues by region had been grouped differently and did not include sales deductions. Revenues by region for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 include sales deductions and thus deviate from our 2013 Audited Financial Statements in which revenues by region for these years do not include sales deductions. (1) Revenues (excl. Iran) represents, for any period, consolidated net revenues of the group, excluding sales into Iran, which we are discontinuing in connection with the Transactions (2) We define EBITDA as the consolidated net result for the period adding back finance expense, finance income, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. We define Historic Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA as adjusted to reflect the extraordinary income and 22 ----- expenses described below. We define Adjusted EBITDA as Historic Adjusted EBITDA excluding the estimated EBITDA generated from sales to Iran in such period. We define FX Spot Rate Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA after giving effect to the pro forma application of the exchange rates as of December 31, 2014 to the twelve month period ended September 30, 2014. We believe that these EBITDA-based measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance and our ability to incur and service our indebtedness. These EBITDA-based measures are not indicators of performance recognized under IFRS or German GAAP. These EBITDA-based measures are not necessarily comparable to the performance figures published by other companies. You should exercise caution in comparing these EBITDA-based measures as reported by us to EBITDA-based measures of other companies.

(B) Reorganization costs relate to expenses incurred to reorganize certain aspects of our operations. These reorganization costs were incurred in connection with new initiatives put in place by our new group management in 2012, including: - in the year ended December 31, 2012: the closing of our plant in Madrid, Spain, and relocation of certain of its former operations and employees to Zaragoza, Spain; as well as related severance expenses; start-up costs related to our plant opening in India; and professional fees and one-off taxes related to the foregoing; - in the year ended December 31, 2013: severance and redundancy costs and consultancy fees related to the transfer of certain operations from Italy and Spain to Slovakia; consultancy and legal fees related to the merger of certain subsidiaries in Germany and the demerger of certain subsidiaries in Austria for tax optimization purposes; the release of a provision for severance and redundancy costs which resulted from certain employees who agreed to relocate from our closed Madrid plant; and - in the nine months ended September 30, 2014: interim management and recruitment costs related to the restructuring of our operations at our facility in Dresden, Germany. (C) Severance and recruitment costs relate to the hiring of our new group management in 2012 and initiatives put in place by our new group management, including: - in the year ended December 31, 2012: severance payments, transaction expenses and legal fees paid in connection with the replacement of the former group chief executive officer and chief financial officer; - in the year ended December 31, 2013: severance payments, transaction expenses and legal fees paid in connection with the replacement of certain other of our senior managers; severance and redundancy costs in connection with headcount rationalization in our Argentina office in 2013; and severance and redundancy costs paid in connection with headcount rationalization in our norms and patent department; and - in the nine months ended September 30, 2014: the transfer of certain of our operations in Rome, Italy, as well as related severance expenses. 23 ----- (D) Project costs and consultancy fees relate to costs and fees incurred in connection with one-off projects, including: - in the year ended December 31, 2012: consultancy fees paid to consultants who advised us on our transition from German GAAP to IFRS and for the implementation of new consolidation software and new consolidation processes; recruiting costs for the search and selection of a new senior management team, for which we reimbursed our shareholders; and incremental expenses attributable to the larger-than-normal supervisory board that our existing shareholders maintained; - in the year ended December 31, 2013: consultancy fees paid to consultants who advised us on our transition from German GAAP to IFRS and for the implementation of new consolidation software and new consolidation processes; consultancy fees related to one-off tax optimization projects, in particular optimization of tax treatment in China; consulting fees related to our now-abandoned plans to sell our facility in Dresden, Germany; consultancy fees paid to an affiliate of one of our existing shareholders for purposes of such shareholder implementing purchasing savings and strategies across its portfolio; and incremental expenses attributable to the larger-than-normal supervisory board that our existing shareholders maintained; and - in the nine months ended September 30, 2014: fees and expenses paid in connection with our sale process. (E) Shareholder loan refinancing costs relate to stamp taxes and consulting, legal and other uncapitalized expenses incurred in relation to the refinancing of a shareholder loan in 2013. (F) Exclusion of EBITDA generated by business with Iran excludes from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA our estimated EBITDA for each period presented that were generated from our sales into Iran, which we are discontinuing in connection with the Transactions. We calculated the EBITDA generated by business with Iran by multiplying net sales into Iran by the EBITDA margin of our Turkish subsidiary (from which our sales to Iran have been made), before applying management and sales costs applicable to the Group on a consolidated basis. The EBITDA margin of our Turkish subsidiary is higher than that of the Wittur Group as a whole. (G) Represents the effect on Adjusted EBITDA of a pro forma application of certain exchange rates as of December 31, 2014, to the twelve months ended September 30, 2014. The pro forma increase results from the euro’s depreciation against the Chinese renminbi and the Turkish lira in 2014. We did not make pro forma adjustments for other exchange rates. The exchange rates as of December 31, 2014, used for the purposes of this adjustment were as follows: €1.00 = RMB7.536 and €1.00 = TRY2.832, not taking into account any currency hedges. The average exchange rates for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 were €1.00 = RMB8.341 and €1.00 = TRY2.890. As of January 29, 2015, the exchange rates were as follows: €1.00 = RMB7.0619 and €1.00 = TRY2.7290. Application of the exchange rates described above is not indicative of any past or future performance. Foreign exchange rates are volatile, and our currency of account, the euro, is subject to increases and decreases in value against other currencies, including the Chinese renminbi and the Turkish lira. The depreciation of the euro against these currencies may not continue in the future, or may reverse, with the relative value of the euro increasing in the future. Such an appreciation of the euro against these currencies in the future would reduce, eliminate or even reverse the effect described above, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations, and such negative impact could be significant. In addition, our results of operations for any particular period will be affected by currency exchange rates over the entire period and not on any particular date, as well as for other exchange rate movements. (3) Adjusted EBITDA margin represents, in any period, Adjusted EBITDA for such period, divided by revenues (excl. Iran) for such period. (4) Gross profit margin represents a quotient equal to (i) revenues for such period, minus costs of goods sold for such period, divided by (ii) revenues for such period. (5) For the year ended December 31, 2011, total capital expenditures represents payments made for investments in tangible assets and intangible assets. For any other period presented, total capital expenditures represents the sum of purchase of property, plant & equipment and purchase of intangible assets for such period. (6) Represents change in working capital as presented in the cash flow statement included in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 and in the interim financial statements for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Working Capital.” (7) For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash conversion represents a quotient equal to (i) EBITDA, minus payments made for investments in tangible assets and intangible assets, divided by (ii) EBITDA. For any other period presented, cash conversion represents a quotient equal to (i) Historic Adjusted EBITDA, minus total capital expenditures, divided by (ii) Historic Adjusted EBITDA. (8) _Pro forma net senior financial debt represents the pro forma gross financial debt of the Group that is senior indebtedness (including structurally senior indebtedness of subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, minus pro forma cash and cash equivalents, after giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on September 30, 2014. (9) _Pro forma net financial debt represents the pro forma gross financial debt of the Group, minus pro forma cash and cash equivalents, after giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on September 30, 2014.

Therefore, our income and results of operations have been influenced, and will continue to be influenced, by the general state and the performance of the commercial and residential real estate markets. The commercial and residential real estate construction markets are volatile, and are affected by a variety of factors, such as economic development, urbanization, demographic growth, mobility, wealth and income levels, consumer confidence, home equity values, home equity loan withdrawals, consumer spending habits, reasonably attainable consumer financing and interest rates. For example, during the recent global financial crisis, the number of new builds in the commercial and residential real estate markets declined sharply. As a result, the demand for elevator components decreased, and our income and results of operations were negatively impacted. If a similar event were to occur again, including any prolonged or significant downturn in the Chinese residential housing and construction market, we would expect our results of operations to be adversely affected. Any downturn in the commercial and residential real estate markets could cause demand for new elevators to decline, which in turn could cause demand for the elevator components we manufacture that are used in new elevator installations to decline. Any deterioration in the commercial or real estate markets could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

In the nine months ended September 30, 2014, our four largest customers (Kone, Otis, Schindler and ThyssenKrupp Elevator) accounted for approximately two-thirds of our revenue, and 92.7% of our revenue in Asia. Our business and results of operations are largely dependent on the success of our significant customers. The loss of any large customer, a decline in the volume of sales to these customers or the deterioration of their financial condition could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We could also be adversely affected if a serious accident occurs due to an elevator installed by one of our primary MNC customers, as such an accident could adversely affect such MNC’s brand, reputation and sales for an extended period of time. MNCs typically do not rely on a single supplier in their outsourcing strategy but are increasingly migrating towards double- or triple-outsourcing strategies pursuant to which they retain two or three suppliers. Such outsourcing can be beneficial to MNCs for several reasons, including to manage the risk of product recall when there is a potential quality issue with any outsourced product. As a result, we may lose some, or all, of the sales volume to one or more of our MNC customers to another of their key suppliers. As MNCs continue to outsource an increasingly greater share of their components, our dependence on these customers may also increase. 26 ----- We do not have binding framework agreements with all of our significant customers, but instead operate on an order-by-order basis with some of them, which means that such customers do not have any contractual obligation to continue to do business with us. For those customers with whom we do have binding framework agreements, the term of such agreements is typically approximately three years, with renewal periods thereafter. We may not successfully be able to renew such agreements, including our “share-of-wallet” agreements with our largest customers on a timely basis, on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, our existing agreements include change of control clauses which entitle our business partners to termination upon the completion of the Acquisition. See “—Risks Related to The Transactions—The Acquisition will entitle our customers and certain other business partners of the Wittur Group to terminate their agreements as a result of change of control provisions.” Failure to renew or extend our sales agreements with our key customers for any reason could have a negative impact on our revenues and business prospects, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

The levels of economic activity vary widely in the different regions and countries where we operate and, in some of these regions and countries, typically display cyclical changes and fluctuations at intervals shorter than a year. A downturn in economic activity, either globally or in the markets in which we operate, could lead, among other effects, to a reduced demand for our products and services, increasing price pressure or increasing the inability of our customers to make payments. For example, during the economic downturn of 2009-2010, our revenues declined by 10-15%. We are most exposed to downturns in Europe (where we generated 46% of our revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014) and Asia (where we generated 40% of our revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014). Because approximately two-thirds of our customers are MNCs, whose business largely fluctuates with the global economic cycles, we are exposed to a decrease in demand resulting from any potential economic downturns. In particular, should the political tensions between Russia and Ukraine continue or should a conflict between the two nations ensue, the strength of the global economy could deteriorate. In mid-December 2014, the Russian central bank significantly increased its base interest rate in light of the weakening of the Russian ruble. This could lead to worsening credit conditions in Russia combined with low growth, which in turn could affect the political and economic condition in both Europe and Asia, as well as impacting our Rest of the World operations, more than 70% of which are in Eurasia (including Russia). Should ongoing political tensions between countries, movements and armed groups in the Middle East continue or should a broader conflict between nations ensue, the strength of the global economy could also deteriorate, harming our business. Concerns about the levels of sovereign debt of several countries of the Eurozone, including Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Spain and Portugal, together with the risk of contagion to other, more stable, countries, particularly France and Germany, has raised uncertainties regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Monetary Union. Concerns that the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis could worsen may lead to the reintroduction of national currencies in one or more Eurozone countries or, in particularly dire circumstances, the abandonment of the euro. The departure or risk of departure from the euro by one or more Eurozone countries or the abandonment of the Euro as a currency could have major negative effects on both existing contractual relations and the fulfillment of obligations by us and/or our customers. It could also spur a global or European economic downturn, which would negatively impact our business. Any material future deterioration in economic conditions for the aforementioned or other reasons could materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations, which could in turn have a negative impact on our revenues, profitability and business prospects, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

An underutilization of our facilities could result in idle capacity costs, write-offs of inventories and losses on products due to falling average sale prices, with falling production volumes causing declines in revenue and earnings. On the other hand, lack of capacity would limit our ability to exploit opportunities for new business, and may hamper relationships with our customers if we are unable to meet their purchasing requirements. Sales to our customers are to a certain extent cyclical and depend, among other things, on general economic conditions as well as on construction trends, which can be affected by a number of factors, including unemployment rates, energy costs, interest rate levels, inflation, globalization, demographic changes, demand for green and sustainable construction, the increasing importance of technology in construction and growing demand from emerging economies such as Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Iran, Northern Africa, Russia and Turkey. Given the variety of such economic parameters influencing the global demand for elevator components, the market volume of elevator component production has historically been, and will continue to be, characterized by a degree of fluctuation, making it difficult for us to accurately predict demand levels for our products aimed at the elevator components sector. The risks related to the nature of the industry in which we operate could have a negative impact on our revenues and business prospects, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

A number of factors drive outsourcing by elevator producers, including (i) the ability of the elevator producer to focus on core activities, such as the elevator installation and maintenance business without having to attend to potential production issues; (ii) increased flexibility of the elevator producer in terms of production capacity and locations as well as increased speed of penetration of new markets; (iii) the ability to free up cash by avoiding capital expenditures for new production facilities; (iv) lack of economies of scale and in-house production capacities of a large number of elevator producers; and (v) the ability of MNCs to access innovation capabilities and best-in-class processes through outsourcing. We estimate that as of December 31, 2014, approximately 55% of the total components market for doors and drives was outsourced to suppliers, as opposed to 45% produced in-house by MNCs. Our business has historically benefited from the outsourcing trend in our industry. However, this trend may not continue, and may even reverse.

The proportion of our business that relates to emerging markets may increase in the future as we further expand into emerging markets such as China. Due to the international scope of our business operations, we face risks with respect to possible geopolitical, economic and social instability, terrorist attacks, natural disasters and epidemics, as well as exposure to adverse government action and to changes in a specific country’s or region’s laws, regulatory requirements and policies affecting trade and investment. These factors could, in addition to directly affecting us, have an adverse effect on the general level of economic activity, which could also indirectly lead to reduced sales 28 ----- opportunities for us and adversely affect our growth prospects. Moreover, certain countries or regions in which we operated in the past and may continue to operate, such as China, India, Argentina, Russia, Turkey, Northern Africa and Brazil, have different business practices and in some cases considerably lower levels of economic, political, and legal stability compared to Western Europe. Emerging markets are, to varying degrees, influenced by political, economic and market conditions in more industrialized countries, particularly the United States and the Eurozone. In particular, changes in the U.S. and European central bank policy and resulting currency devaluations may lead to significant economic volatility in emerging markets. Our presence and growth plans in China expose us to significant risks linked to the Chinese economy. In 2012, China’s economic growth decelerated to its slowest pace since the global financial crisis. China was significantly impacted by the contraction in the Eurozone economy, which, until 2012, when the United States surpassed the Eurozone, had been China’s biggest export partner. The Chinese government focuses heavily on investment to stimulate growth in the Chinese economy. However, it is unclear whether such actions to stimulate growth will be coupled with increasingly strict regulation. A significant factor impacting economic growth in China has been the Chinese residential housing market, with demand for housing driving a boom in construction and related raw materials. However, in the second half of 2014, housing prices in China declined compared to 2013, sparking concern that China may suffer a residential real estate crisis similar to that suffered in the United States in 2008-2009. While the near-term future of the Chinese housing and construction markets cannot be predicted, any significant slowdown in new construction in China could impact our business in China and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees. See also “—Our industry exhibits correlation to new construction in the commercial and residential real estate markets.” The Chinese “shadow banking” sector has grown rapidly in recent years, and a significant amount of credit and liquidity is provided by Chinese institutions outside the scope of financial regulation. Due to the lack of supervision, the complexity of shadow banking activities and the close connection between the shadow banking sector and the regulated financial sector, any significant liquidity shortages or defaults in the shadow banking sector may have a material impact on the economic climate in China.

We compete with both large international market participants as well as with numerous smaller regional and local suppliers that vary 30 ----- depending on the region. Our competitive position also varies in the individual product sub-markets (such as submarkets for different types of elevator components and complete elevators) and regions. If we are unable to continue to provide our services to existing clients, to develop new service portfolios, to attract new clients, to respond to client trends, to increase our operating efficiency and to reduce our operating and overhead costs, we may not be able to successfully compete. Furthermore, in many of the markets in which we compete, customers place a strong emphasis on local manufacturing capabilities, and we may be unable to quickly expand our manufacturing capacities as required in certain fast-growing regions, and thus lose market share in such regions. Our expansion in certain markets, such as China and India, which are generally characterized by lower costs of production, rapid growth and high levels of low-cost, low-quality competition. In addition, many of our competitors may have the resources to reduce their sales prices to below market-competitive rates to gain market share. The level of development in many markets in which we operate is determined to a certain extent by technological changes and innovation, and our strategy is therefore particularly directed towards being perceived as a technology leader in the such markets. This requires continuous investments in research and development. Despite our efforts and investments, existing or new competitors may develop their current products and technologies further, create alternative products that are more attractively priced, offer products of a higher quality or a broader functionality than our products or offer products that are more appealing than our products for other reasons. Furthermore, our research and development may be insufficient to meet our customers’ demands in time, and we may become unable to meet product specifications due to a lack of research and development expertise. Additionally, our existing competitors and new entrants may have greater operational, financial and other resources or may otherwise be better positioned to develop new products and compete for opportunities and, as a result, our business may be less successful. New or better-developed products may potentially be offered at more attractive prices and, if such products are more attractive than our products for any other reason such as a higher degree of functionality, demand for our products could fall. In addition, even though large MNCs primarily focus on the installation of elevators and maintenance services and we generally are not active in these areas, we may compete with some of our customers with respect to certain products.

Historically, we have been able to pass costs through to our customers, however, even to the extent that we are successful in compensating for or passing on our increased costs to our customers by increasing prices, the positive effects of such price increases for us may not occur in the periods in which the additional expenses have been incurred, but in later periods. In that event, the price increases will not have a compensating effect for the periods in which the costs increased. If costs of raw materials rise, and if we are not able to undertake cost saving measures elsewhere in our operations or increase the selling prices of our products, we will not be able to mitigate such cost increases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

The terms of the Indenture and the Senior Facilities will permit the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including in respect of committed borrowings of up to €65.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Capitalization.” The degree to which we will be leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important consequences for holders of the Notes, including the following: - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes; - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product research and development or other general corporate purposes; - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment and the industry in which we operate; - placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged; and - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

We intend to provide funds to the Issuer in order to meet the obligations on the Notes primarily through payments under the Proceeds Loan. Given our Group’s global operations, we have a large number of operating subsidiaries and business participations, which individually contribute to our Group’s results. Therefore, in order to be able to meet its obligations to pay interest and principal to you under the Notes, the Issuer will be dependent on the operating subsidiaries and business of the 40 ----- Target and its subsidiaries. If the Proceeds Loan or dividends or other intercompany loans do not distribute sufficient cash to the Issuer to make scheduled payments on the Notes, the ability of the Issuer to make payments may be limited. Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. In particular, the Senior Facilities limit the ability to upstream cash to the Issuer apart from specific exemptions, including to service debt of the Issuer up to a cap specified by the Senior Facilities. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuer will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to it. Under German law, all dividends may only be distributed out of current profits and distributable reserves, and, generally, interim dividend distributions are not allowed under German law. The subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes. The inability to transfer cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that, even though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet their obligations, they may not be permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity in their restricted group to another entity in their restricted group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations. The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

All these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. In particular, our ability to incur debt at our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes (including subsidiaries in China) will be limited, and therefore could limit our ability to execute our growth strategy in such regions. Certain of the covenants under the Indenture and the Senior Facilities impose limitations based on euro amounts (e.g., the amount of additional indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur). As such, if the euro were to significantly decrease in value, the restrictions imposed by these covenants would become tighter, further restricting our ability to finance our operations and conduct our day-to-day business. The Senior Facilities also contain restrictive covenants that, in most cases, are more restrictive than the covenants contained in the Indenture. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Senior Facilities, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors 41 ----- could cancel the availability of the facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Facilities, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, any default or acceleration under the Senior Facilities could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indenture (in the case of an acceleration). If our creditors, including the creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement, accelerate the payment of those amounts or, in the case of letters of credit, require the provision of cash collateral, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay or, as the case may be, pay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under our Senior Facilities Agreement will also have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them securing the indebtedness owed to them. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees will be deemed to be secured on a second-priority basis to obligations under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations and additional senior financial indebtedness permitted to be incurred in the future. As a result, enforcement proceeds from the Shared Collateral will be applied first to the indebtedness under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations and, if any such additional financial indebtedness is incurred, then to such additional indebtedness in respect of second lien obligations, in each case, before any distributions are made on our obligations under the Notes. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

The Notes will mature in 2023. See “Description of the Notes.” At the maturity of the Notes, or at the maturity of any other debt which we incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, or if we are otherwise restricted from doing so due to corporate, tax or contractual limitations, we may be required to refinance our indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain such refinancing on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities or capital expenditures, sell assets or raise additional debt or equity financing in amounts that could be substantial. The type, timing and terms of any future financing will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We may not be able to accomplish any of these measures in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our Senior Facilities Agreement, the Indenture and any future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these measures.

We have the ability to borrow up to €65.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility, which will be secured by the Shared Collateral and other collateral provided by the Group, and the Senior Facilities and the Indenture also permit the incurrence of an additional €50.0 million facility thereunder. The Indenture and the Senior Facilities also permit us to incur a substantial amount of indebtedness at subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and to incur indebtedness that shares in the Collateral or that benefits from security interests over assets that do not secure the Notes. Any debt that our subsidiaries incur could be structurally or effectively senior to the Notes to the extent that such subsidiaries do not guarantee the Notes, and other debt could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes. Although the Senior 42 ----- Facilities Agreement and the Indenture will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indenture will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements.

In March 2011, the European Council agreed on the need for Eurozone countries to establish a permanent stability mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism (the “ESM”), to be activated by mutual agreement and to assume the role of the EFSF and the EFSM in providing external financial assistance to Eurozone countries after June 2013. In December 2011, the European Council and each Eurozone country agreed to a package of measures designed to restore confidence and address the continued tensions in financial markets, including (i) bringing forward implementation of the ESM from June 2013 to as soon as Member States representing 90% of the capital commitments to the ESM have ratified the ESM treaty, which occurred on September 27, 2012, and (ii) a new fiscal compact between all 19 Eurozone countries (with restricted application to Latvia and Lithuania) and, subject to parliamentary vote, all other non-Eurozone countries (except the United Kingdom) to put deficit restrictions on Member State budgets, with associated sanctions for those Members States who violate the specified limits. Despite these measures, concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries (including, most recently, Cyprus and Slovenia), and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Member States. These and other concerns could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Member States or, possibly, the dissolution of the euro entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of eurodominated obligations and for parties subject to other contractual provisions referencing the euro such a supply contracts would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could have adverse consequences for us with respect to our outstanding debt obligations that are euro-denominated, such as the Notes, and, as we have a substantial amount of debt denominated in euro, our financial condition may be materially affected. In January 2015, the European Central Bank announced a large asset-buying program, similar to the “quantitative easing” program undertaken by the U.S. Treasury. Upon this announcement, the value of the euro fell against other major currencies. The future effects of this asset-buying program are unknown, but they could lead to increased volatility, a decline in the value of the euro or inflation in the Eurozone. In addition, such measures may not be successful in assuaging concerns about sovereign debt in Europe.

Currency exchange fluctuations could cause losses if assets denominated in currencies with a 43 ----- falling exchange rate lose value, while at the same time liabilities denominated in currencies with a rising exchange rate appreciate. In addition, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could enhance or minimize fluctuations in the prices of raw materials, since we purchase a considerable part of the raw materials which we source in foreign currencies. As a result of these factors, fluctuations in exchange rates could affect our results of operations. External and internal transactions involving the delivery of products and services to or by third parties result in cash inflows and outflows which are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency, the euro. The future use of derivative hedging instruments by us is generally dependent on the availability of adequate credit lines with appropriate financial institutions. As a result, we could be unable to use derivative financial instruments in the future, to the extent necessary, and our hedging strategy could therefore ultimately be adversely impacted. Furthermore, any hedging transactions executed in the form of derivative financial instruments may negatively impact our profit due to changes in the market-to-market valuation if hedge accounting is not applied. In addition, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks arising from external and internal loan agreements, which result from cash inflows and outflows in currencies other than the functional currency of our respective group member. These foreign exchange risks are, in general, hedged against by using appropriate derivative financial instruments, particularly currency forwards or swaps and cross currency interest-rate swaps. Our net foreign investments are generally not hedged against exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, a number of our consolidated companies report their results in currencies other than the euro, which requires us to convert the relevant items into euro when preparing our consolidated financial statements.

For example, the shares and other Collateral that are pledged or assigned or transferred for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of these shares or other assets may not be liquid and their value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, even if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Furthermore, any shares pledged to secure the Notes and the Guarantees may have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, potentially leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, 47 ----- the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. The value of the Collateral may not be sufficient for the proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests created over the Collateral to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, in the event of any distribution of the proceeds from the sale of certain Collateral, the lenders under the Senior Facilities will be entitled to receive from such distribution payment in full in cash before the holders of the Notes will be entitled to receive any payment from such distribution. Moreover, the value of the Collateral may be diluted. The Indenture will permit the granting of certain liens over the Collateral other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the security documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Similarly, if we issue additional notes under the Indenture, holders of such additional notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Unless a subsidiary is a Guarantor, the Issuer’s subsidiaries will not have any obligations to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, nonguarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder. Accordingly, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction: - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to proceed against the assets of such non-guarantor subsidiary; and - creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary. In addition, the Indenture governing the Notes will, subject to some limitations, permit these subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and will not contain any limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such as trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries. 48 ----- As such, the Notes, each Guarantee the Proceeds Loan and each other intercompany proceeds loan will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our nonGuarantor subsidiaries.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that a common security agent, who will serve as the Shared Security Agent for the secured parties with respect to the Shared Collateral, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement.

The existence of any such restrictions, exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agents to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests of the Security Agents will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. The Security Agents may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agents will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agents may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. 49 ----- In addition, our business requires a variety of permits and licenses.

In the event of foreclosure, the grant of permits and licenses may be revoked, the transfer of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require us to incur significant cost and expense. Further, we cannot assure you that the applicable governmental authorities will consent to the transfer of all such permits.

In addition, enforcement of each Guarantee will be limited to the extent of the amount which can be guaranteed by a particular Guarantor without rendering the Guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under, or contrary to, applicable law and enforcement of each security interest in the Collateral will be limited to the extent of the amount which can be secured by a particular grantor of Collateral without rendering the security interest voidable or otherwise ineffective under, or contrary to, applicable law. For example, the Guarantees by our Italian subsidiaries, Wittur Italia Holding s.r.l. and Wittur S.p.A., are expected to be limited to €5.0 million and €1.0 million, respectively (based on a Completion Date of March 31, 2015). The limitation of the Italian Guarantees will be calculated as a percentage of the intercompany proceeds loans used to refinance existing indebtedness of our Italian subsidiaries and could be higher or lower, depending on the amount of outstanding local debt on the actual Completion Date. In addition, the Guarantee provided by Wittur Asanso¨r San. V Tic. A.S., our subsidiary in Turkey, will be capped at €2.5 million due to local considerations. However, we cannot provide any assurances that holders of the Notes will be able to recover even these amounts under such Guarantees, as payment under each Guarantee is contractually subordinated to all the senior indebtedness of such Guarantor, including such Guarantor’s obligations under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations. Enforcement of any of the Guarantees or the Collateral against any Guarantor and any grantor of Collateral will also be subject to certain defenses available to guarantors and grantors of security interests generally. These defenses include, primarily with respect to subsidiary Guarantors and subsidiary grantors of Collateral, those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, insolvency, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, preservation of share capital, capital maintenance, the statutory and fiduciary duties of the directors and officers of any Guarantor, thin capitalization and defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and similar laws, a court could subordinate or void any guarantee or security interest provided by such Guarantor or security grantor if it found that: - the Guarantee was incurred or the security interest granted with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the respective guarantor or security grantor; 51 ----- - the relevant Guarantor or security grantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the Guarantee or the security interest granted, and the relevant Guarantor or security grantor: (i) was insolvent or was rendered insolvent because of the Guarantee or security interest granted; (ii) was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the Guarantee or security interest granted; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debt beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the Guarantee or security interest granted was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant Guarantor or security grantor or was not in the best interests or for the benefit of the relevant guarantor or security grantor; or - the amount payable or secured under the relevant Guarantee or the Collateral was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. The measure of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance and similar laws varies depending on the law applied. Generally, however, a Guarantor or security grantor would be considered insolvent if it could not pay its debts as they became due. In such circumstances, if a court voided such Guarantee or Collateral, or held it unenforceable, holders of the Notes and the Security Agents, as applicable, would cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor or the relevant Collateral, would be creditors solely of the Issuer and any remaining Guarantors and would benefit only from any remaining Collateral. The holders of the Notes and the Security Agents may also be required to repay any amounts received with respect to such Guarantee or such Collateral. The grant of Collateral or Guarantees may also be voidable by the grantor or Guarantor or by an insolvency trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may be otherwise set aside by a court, if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor or Guarantor is deemed to be insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured parties to receive a greater recovery than if the grant had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor or Guarantor is commenced within a legally specified “clawback” period following the grant. Further, the Guarantees and the Collateral may be subject to claims that they should be limited or subordinated under German, United States or other applicable law. The enforcement of the Guarantees and the Collateral will be limited to the extent that the granting of such Guarantees and the Collateral is not in the corporate interest of the relevant Guarantor or provider of security, would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws or that the burden of such Guarantee or Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees exceed the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or provider of security. In particular, for the subsidiary Guarantors and providers of Collateral organized under German law, each of their respective Guarantee or Collateral will be contractually limited to the extent the granting of such Guarantee or enforcement of such Collateral would result in a breach of capital maintenance rules or other statutory laws or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or provider of Collateral to contravene their duties to incur civil or criminal liability or to contravene any legal prohibition. Accordingly, enforcement of any Guarantee and Collateral would be subject to certain defenses available to the grantors thereof generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the Indenture and/or the documents governing the Guarantees and the Collateral designed to ensure compliance with applicable legal requirements. As a result, the Issuer’s, the Guarantors’ and the security grantors’ liability under the Guarantees and the Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law applicable to it. In the event that any Guarantee or Collateral is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee or security obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the relevant Guarantor or security grantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes, or any Guarantee or Collateral is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full, at at all, any amounts outstanding under the Notes.

However, under certain circumstances, such debt may also be subordinated despite the shareholder holding 10% or less of such debtor’s share capital. German law does not expressly exclude debt securities, such as the Notes, from the scope of equitable subordination and thus any holder of Notes who simultaneously (directly or indirectly) holds an equity interest of 52 ----- more than 10% in the Issuer or a Guarantor could be subject to equitable subordination under German insolvency laws. In addition, there is a risk that even third party creditors, if such creditors are affiliated with the debtor or its shareholders or could otherwise be regarded as “shareholder-like,” are treated like shareholders in that loans or other debt they granted to the debtor would be equitably subordinated under German insolvency laws. German law does not specify a test to determine whether any creditor is shareholder-like and thus the holders of the Notes may be considered shareholder-like and their claims under the Notes and the Guarantees may be equitably subordinated in an insolvency of the Issuer or a German Guarantor.

(3) As of the Completion Date, we expect the €65.0 million Revolving Credit Facility under the Senior Facility to remain undrawn. (4) Local lines of credit consist of certain local working capital and exports subsidy lines of credit for our subsidiaries in Argentina, Austria, India and Turkey, that we assume will be repaid in connection with the Transactions. As of September 30, 2014, we had approximately €5.6 million (equivalent) outstanding and an additional €5.4 million (equivalent) available under these local lines of credit. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Local Credit Lines.” However, we may eventually choose not to repay some or all of these local lines of credit. If we do not repay these local lines of credit, the amount of our equity investment or the amount of cash on the balance sheet of the Target used to finance the Acquisition would decrease by the amount of such local lines not repaid, and our indebtedness on an as adjusted basis would increase by a corresponding amount. If we repay these local lines of credit, we expect to be able to redraw them in the future. (5) Includes current and non-current portions of liabilities in respect of finance leases. (6) The aggregate principal amount of the Notes is stated gross of any capitalized issue costs.

433,Offerings 2015.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,,"We are the world’s leading independent elevator components manufacturer. The elevator components industry is characterized by long-term growth and resilience during economic downturns due to a number of favorable factors. Demand for elevators has grown significantly faster than GDP due to a number of favorable global trends, such as population growth, urbanization, taller buildings, aging populations, increased wealth and increased regulation and safety awareness. As a manufacturer of elevator components operating independently from elevator installers, we also benefit from the trend of elevator installers increasingly seeking to outsource the manufacture of components, which has increased the rate of growth for elevator components manufacturers above the growth in demand for elevators. Our position as the leading independent elevator components manufacturer has enabled us to capitalize on these growth trends, as evidenced by our strong long-term revenue growth and EBITDA margins in excess of 10% on average since 2004. We are a global manufacturer of elevator components with a strong footprint across multiple regions. We divide our operations into three geographical regions which include Europe, Asia and the Rest of the World. Our Europe region includes our operations in Africa and represents our core market, accounting for 48.6% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2013, with upside potential as Southern European economies recover. Our Asia region provides the growth engine for our business, with 37.4% of our revenue, driven by increased urbanization and other favorable trends in China, and with the potential to grow spare parts sales in China as the market matures. Our Rest of the World region primarily includes Eurasia, Turkey, the Middle East and Latin America and represented 13.9% of our revenue, with the potential for significant future growth. Our product offering features a large range of elevator components for new elevator manufacturing and sourcing, for spare parts and for modernization and upgrades. Our components span from sophisticated mechatronic components for elevator cabin and landing doors (including the associated opening mechanisms) to other critical components such as gearless drives, slings, safety gears and cars. We also offer complete elevators, which we primarily sell to independent elevator installers (“Independents”). Sales of doors and door components accounted for 69% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2013. Doors and door components are required at each floor of a building, so as the average height of new buildings increases, the demand for elevator doors and door components also increases at a faster rate than demand for other components. Doors and door components range from relatively standardized, high-volume production doors to highly customized, special-order doors—we offer 19 models of landing doors and 15 models of elevator car doors. Having produced approximately 1.2 million doors and door components in the year ended December 31, 2013, we believe we are the leading elevator door and door components supplier in a highly fragmented elevator components market. We manufacture components for both the original equipment market and the aftermarket. We estimate that the original equipment market makes up a larger percentage of our business in developing countries, such as 69 ----- China, while the aftermarket makes up approximately 50% of our sales in a mature market such as Europe. Aftermarket sales range from routine provision of spare parts through the lifetime of an elevator, to components for modernization and upgrade of an elevator, to complete replacement of an elevator. In developing markets such as China, we expect aftermarket components sales to strongly increase as the life cycle of newly-installed elevators progresses. Our key customers are global, multinational corporation elevator installers (“MNCs”), such as westernbased MNCs Kone, Otis, Schindler and ThyssenKrupp Elevator (“Western MNCs”) and Asian-based MNCs Fujitec, Hitachi, Hyundai, Mitsubishi Electric and Toshiba (“Asian MNCs”), as well as Independents, which are typically active in a limited geographic market. In the year ended December 31, 2013, Western MNCs accounted for approximately 68% of our revenue, Independents for approximately 32% of our revenue and Asian MNCs for less than 1% of our revenue. We have deeply-ingrained, mutually-dependent relationships with a number of our key customers, and benefit from multi-year, guaranteed “share-of-wallet” contracts with a number of our key customers, allowing us to share in the growth of our customers’ business. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, we generated revenue of €501.4 million and Historic Adjusted EBITDA of €72.7 million. As of September 30, 2014, we had a work force of 3,206 employees and conducted business in more than 50 countries.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Demand for new installations of elevators is primarily influenced by continued population growth, as well as an increase in the global urbanization rate. Urban populations surpassed rural populations in 2010 for the first time in history. While overall population growth in emerging markets significantly outpaces population growth in Europe and North America, we believe that the pace at which urbanization takes place in key emerging markets, such as China and India, is not substantially higher than the urbanization rates of more developed countries. We believe this suggests that the growth of the urban population in these emerging markets will continue in the future. For example, a Global consulting firm has established that China’s urban population will increase from 50% in 2011 to 70% in 2030. Growing population and increasing urbanization have historically led to an increase in construction activity, which historically, has also benefited the elevator components industry. Rising levels of wealth and GDP per capita also drive demand for elevators. We believe that urban residential floor space per capita is closely correlated to urban GDP per capita, and a gap still exists between developed economies in Europe (such as Italy with urban residential space of 45 square meters per capita) and emerging market economies, such as China (with urban residential space of 24-26 square meters per capita). As GDP per capita increases in emerging markets, demand for increased floor space per capita also increases, leading to a further increase in construction activity in urban areas. This increased demand for floor space per capita as well as the increasing density of urban regions, particularly in Asia, is expected to lead to taller buildings, which, in turn, is expected to lead to an increase in demand for new elevator installations in excess of construction activity.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

For example, we expect the implementation of EU Directive EN 81-20/50, which will overhaul the existing regulatory regime in Europe and introduce heightened safety requirements for elevators, to lead to an increase in demand for modernization to comply with the new regulations. 70 ----- We also expect demand for elevator maintenance to continue to be supported by an existing, mature installed elevator base in Europe, as well as maturing installed elevator bases in China and India in the near future. See also “—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Demand for elevator modernization and maintenance.” Rising energy costs, environmental awareness, as well as regulatory requirements to reduce the carbon footprint of new and modernized construction projects, are expected to increase the demand for energy efficient elevators equipped with, for example, gearless drive ranges (which also reduce backlash, vibration and noise) and high suspension loads. Continuation of these trends would further drive modernization of the installed elevator base.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442
433,Offerings 2015.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Trends,17.2.3,Increased outsourcing,"The outsourcing of the production of elevator components by global MNCs and Independents to suppliers is an ongoing trend which has historically driven demand for elevator parts. We expect this trend to continue in the future. A number of factors drives outsourcing by elevator producers, including (i) the ability of the elevator producer to focus on core activities, such as the elevator installation and maintenance business without having to attend to potential production issues; (ii) increased flexibility of the elevator producer in terms of production capacity and locations, as well as increased speed of penetration of new markets; (iii) the ability to free up cash by avoiding capital expenditures for new production facilities; (iv) lack of economies of scale and in-house production capacities of a large number of elevator producers; and (v) the ability of MNCs to access innovation capabilities and best-in-class processes through outsourcing. Generally, Western MNCs have outsourced a high portion of their components, a trend that we expect to continue as a result of increasing standardization of platforms. Outsourcing allows Western MNCs to reduce the complexity and cost of their own product offering. In contrast, Asian MNCs have historically been more reluctant to outsource production on a large scale; however, we expect Asian MNCs to outsource business in target growth markets outside their traditional home markets (such growth markets including India, South East Asia and, potentially, China) in the future to, for example, preserve cash for footprint expansion, and maintain flexibility in terms of production capacity and location. Independents have historically outsourced the largest portion of component modules due to their lack of scale and in-house production capabilities, and we expect leading Independents to continue to require support from suppliers, such as us that are able to provide them with tailored solutions and comply with increasingly stringent local regulations.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

We also offer complete elevators. Customer demand for elevator components is primarily driven by new elevator installations, both in newly constructed buildings and existing structures, as well as the need for modernization and maintenance of the installed base. These factors are affected by general global economic conditions and the economic and political conditions in the regions in which we operate our business. Demand for new elevator installations in any geographic market, particularly for new construction, is largely driven by the activity in the construction industry in that market. The construction industry is generally cyclical in nature, and its performance has historically demonstrated a strong correlation with GDP growth and unemployment levels. It is also sensitive to factors such as demographics, inflation, interest rates and the cost of financing, including mortgage financing, as well as other macroeconomic factors. Political instability or changes in fiscal or other government policies may also affect the construction industry. In addition, the construction industry is also subject to customer preferences that are specific to each of the countries in which we operate. Elevator modernization and maintenance have historically been less cyclical in nature than the construction industry in general, and the level of cyclicality is primarily driven by the size and age of the installed base of a particular region, as well as by regulation and energy efficiency requirements in such region. Nevertheless, as large-scale, non-essential maintenance projects may require significant levels of capital investments, and as our business depends on our customers’ willingness to commit funds to these projects, prolonged periods of economic uncertainty or political instability may lead to a decline in modernization and maintenance activity and adversely affect our revenue. 71 -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,442
433,Offerings 2015.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition,17.3.2,Demand for elevator modernization and maintenance,"We sell elevator components for use in both new elevator installations and for modernizations, upgrades and maintenance spare parts. The share of our business constituting modernizations, upgrades and maintenance spare parts compared to new elevator installations varies by region, depending on the age of the installed base of elevators and the pace of new installation. For example, we estimate that modernization, upgrades and maintenance spare parts constitute approximately 50% of our sales in a mature market such as Europe, but currently represent only 10% of our sales in emerging markets, such as China. Elevator modernization and maintenance is also driven by increased safety regulation as well as increased energy efficiency standards. While the installed elevator base in Europe is relatively old, with approximately 60% of installed elevators older than 10 years, and thus unlikely to further age on an average basis, only 10% of installed elevators in China and 20% of installed elevators in India are older than 10 years. As a result, a Global consulting firm expects a significant ageing of installed elevator bases in China and India in the near future to lead to a strong increase in modernization activity in these countries. We believe this factor will provide for increased visibility and resilience in the sales of elevator components. Furthermore, in 2014, the European Union adopted EU Directive EN 81 20/50, which represents a major overhaul of the currently applicable safety regulations for elevators and which introduces, among other things, higher standards for door pressure testing, a new door pendulum shock test and new rules for door retaining devices. Historically, non-European Union countries have adopted European regulations, and a number of key emerging markets, such as China, are expected to adopt EU EN 81 20/50 in the near future. We expect that this regulatory overhaul will drive elevator modernization as MNCs and other manufacturers of elevators will be required to comply with EU EN 81 20/15 from 2017. Elevator modernization and maintenance is also driven by an increasing regulatory focus on energy efficiency and environmental protection. For example, EU Directive 2002/91/EC on Energy Performance of Buildings aims to decrease energy consumption in buildings by 20% by 2020 and directs European Union member states to introduce energy efficiency targets for newly constructed and renovated buildings. Kone estimates that elevators currently account for approximately 8% of total energy consumption in single and multidwelling units and in non-industrial properties. Modernized elevators recover the energy that is released when the elevator is used, allowing for energy savings of 20%-35%. We believe that we are well-positioned to capture future modernization and maintenance opportunities resulting from these factors, particularly in China and India where we are one of few companies with longstanding modernization and maintenance experience as a result of our operations in Europe.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442
433,Offerings 2015.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition,17.3.3,Steel prices and our ability to pass on cost increases to our customers,"Direct material costs (the accounting term used in our accounts to represent raw material costs) constitute a large portion of our production costs, and fluctuations in the price of our raw materials affect our results of operations. In the year ended December 31, 2013, direct material costs accounted for €240.1 million, or 67.1% of our cost of sales. The primary raw materials used in our production processes are metal sheets and coils, carbon steel and stainless steel, but we also purchase other steel products such as steel rolled profiles. Steel products are our most important raw material and we estimate that steel products accounted for approximately one-third of our raw material costs in the year ended December 31, 2013. As a result, the market price of steel impacts our results of operations. Other raw materials used in our business include aluminium and titanium, and exhibit similar market dynamics as those exhibited by the market for steel. Generally, the price for steel correlates to general economic conditions. For example, steel prices peaked in 2008, subsequently declined as a result of the global economic downturn in 2009 and 2010, and increased sharply in the wake of economic recovery in 2011. Future spikes in the price for steel or other raw materials could significantly increase our cost of sales. We currently do not hedge against fluctuations in steel prices, but our management has adopted new policies in 2012 pursuant to which we manage these costs. We estimate that approximately 60% by value of the steel contained in our products is sold based on current spot prices. For these purchases, the steel price component is assessed individually for each order, and increases in market prices for steel can be passed through to our customers without significant lead time. The remaining approximately 40% by value of steel content in our product is sold pursuant to contracts with two of our key MNC customers which provide for pass-through 72 ----- mechanisms and reflect the fact that these customers themselves purchase large quantities of steel. One passthrough mechanism, which applies to the majority of our steel content sold to these two customers, fixes the steel price we can charge at the relevant customer’s average steel purchasing price during the preceding six months. This fixed price remains binding for six months, after which it is reset pursuant to the same mechanism. As a result, any increases in the average steel price are passed through to these two MNCs with a six month delay. The other pass-through mechanism, which we carry out in Europe with one of our MNC customers, provides for a certain percentage representing an assumed fixed percentage of the steel make-up of our products and allows us to pass-through 90% of any price increases during a six month review period. However, steel prices might rise in the period between when we negotiate the price for a project and the time we purchase steel for that project. In addition, since approximately 40% by value of our steel content is sold pursuant to the pass-through mechanisms described above, we are exposed to changes in steel prices for up to six months until the fixed steel price we charge our customers can be readjusted. The positive effects of such readjustments may not occur in the periods in which the additional expenses have been incurred, but only in later periods. In that event, the price increases will not have a compensating effect for the periods in which the costs increased. We try to manage these risks by anticipating both our steel requirements and movements in the market price for steel in advance. Under some of our contracts, our customers have undertaken to share their order intake and production forecasts with us and have guaranteed us a minimum “share-of-wallet” with them. We believe this improves our visibility on future steel requirements in the short and medium term and thus the accuracy of our forecasts. While we believe we have generally been able to pass through increased raw material prices to our customers in the past three years, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so. This could affect our results of operations for the period in which we are unable to pass through price increases.

Sales in mature markets are typically driven by demand for modernization and maintenance of the installed elevator base, as well as spare parts, which in turn are influenced by changes in the regulatory framework, safety requirements and the focus on energy efficient and environmentally friendly products. We also operate a significant part of our business in emerging markets (particularly, China, India, Eurasia and Latin America) and our Asia and Rest of the World regions accounted for 37.4% and 13.9% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013, respectively. Sales in emerging markets have historically been driven by strong demand for new installations of elevators, particularly in China, which accounted for approximately 55% of global new elevator installations in 2014, and India, which accounted for approximately 5% of all new elevator installations in 2013. We have expanded our global footprint, in particular in emerging markets, significantly over the three years ended December 31, 2013 and such expansion has affected our results of operations, including our capital expenditures and cost base. We have been early entrants into a number of emerging markets with local production, such as Turkey (1993), China (1995), Argentina and Brazil (both 2000), Slovakia (2009) and India (2010). The expansion of our operational footprint and the development of business in a new market affects our results of operations in a number of ways. First, the period during which we enter a new market is usually characterized by increased capital expenditures necessary to establish an operational footprint in that market. Second, while our operations in a new market are still in the start-up phase, these operations usually contribute negative EBITDA to our consolidated results, mainly as a result of a lack in generated revenue to offset costs, such as costs related to marketing, establishing a sales force or general legal and administrative expenses. However, once we have solidified our operations in an emerging market and fully established a local presence and local workforce, our operations usually benefit from a lower cost base compared to our more mature markets. For example, we are currently evaluating the relocation of some of our Austrian production capabilities to our facilities in India to take advantage of the lower cost base and proximity to growth markets for our business.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

The focus of these measures was mainly on 73 ----- the transfer of production to lower cost locations and headcount reductions in the manufacturing area. For example, as part of these measures, we closed our plant in Madrid, Spain and moved our production capacity and business operations to our plant in Zaragoza, Spain. Additionally, we sold our plant in Bergamo, Italy, which resulted in a strategic headcount reduction of 62 full-time equivalent employees during 2013. Furthermore, our shift of production facilities and capabilities to lower-cost countries has reduced our labor costs. In connection with these restructuring and operational improvement measures, we incurred expenses of €3.0 million and €8.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In contrast, we estimate that we realized synergies and cost savings of €9.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of these measures. To optimize our supply chain and further increase overall product quality and safety, we appointed a global supply chain manager in 2012 who is responsible for implementing and monitoring our global purchasing and logistics strategy as well as supplier quality development. Additionally, in 2012, we created a centralized global procurement platform and consolidated our supplier base, focusing on larger, global suppliers and reducing the number of local suppliers. As a result, we have been able to realize substantial procurement cost savings and increase the transparency of our cost structure, and we estimate that our supply chain optimization measures reduced our cost base by 3.6% in the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.

Transactional risk arises when our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than their functional currency. We currently operate production facilities in ten countries, and sell our products into approximately 100 countries. As a result, we generate a significant portion of our sales and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than euro, our reporting currency. The primary currencies in which we generated revenues in twelve months ended September 30, 2014 were the euro, the Chinese renminbi and the U.S. dollar, and we expect the portion of our sales and costs denominated in renminbi to increase as we continue to expand our Chinese operations. Where we are unable to match sales received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, our results of operations are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. For example, a stronger euro will increase the cost of euro-denominated supplies for our non-euro businesses and conversely decrease the cost of non-euro supplies for our euro businesses. A 5% increase/(decrease) of the euro against the Chinese renminbi or the Turkish lira in 2013 would have increased/(decreased) our earnings before tax for the year ended December 31, 2013 by €95,000/€(95,000) and €583,000/€(583,000), respectively. Our subsidiaries generally execute their sales and incur most of their materials costs in the same currency. 74 ----- We present our consolidated financial statements in euro. As a result, we must translate the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of all of our operations with a functional currency other than euro into euro at thenapplicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of these currencies against the euro may affect the value of our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses with respect to our non-euro businesses in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency, which creates translation risk. These translations could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity. We record the effects of these translations in our income statement as other income or other expenses.

433,Offerings 2015.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition,17.3.8,Customer concentration,"Our business depends on, and is strongly aligned with the businesses of, our four largest customers. We generate approximately two-thirds of our revenues, with one of these four customers accounting for a significant proportion of those revenues and another one of these four customers also representing a significant and growing portion of our revenues. We are a trusted supplier to our largest customers, who include Kone, Schindler, Otis and ThyssenKrupp Elevator. Our long-standing relationships with each of these customers have allowed us to better understand these customers’ needs and priorities, thereby enabling us to cater to their requirements, from conception, design and development to manufacturing and distribution of components to offering comprehensive after-sale services and technical support. We also grow our business in line with our largest MNC customers and expand our operations into geographies into which they expand to better serve them. Our success has historically mirrored those of our largest customers. Our industry is marked by a relatively small number of large customers, and we expect this high concentration of customers to continue for the foreseeable future. The high level of customer concentration in our industry entails a high degree of dependence on our key customers. If we were to lose any of our key customers, we may be unable to find an alternative customer of similar size, or otherwise compensate for such loss, in a timely manner, or at all. Additionally, our business has historically benefited from the growth of our customers’ businesses, and for this reason we depend on the performance of our customers’ business and their ability to continue growing their business and outsourcing to us. In light of the maturity of the European elevator components market, our ability to win contracts with new customers in the European market is impacted by whether we succeed in taking market share from our competitors in Europe. Additionally, customers in our industry face time and cost-related barriers to selecting new suppliers for their elevators, as changing suppliers requires new homologation of such components and the review and adjustment of all maintenance manuals. However, these cost-related barriers also partly insulate us against the risk of losing any of our key customers, as any of our customers would incur significant switching costs if it decided to terminate our business relationship and source its components from one of our competitors. In addition, we have long-standing relationships with each of these key customers, which we have maintained over the past 15 to 30 years. These long-standing relationships have allowed us to better understand our customers’ needs and priorities, thereby enabling us to cater to our customers from conception, design and development to manufacturing and distribution of components to offering comprehensive after-sale services and technical support. Another factor mitigating the risk of losing any of our MNCs as customers is that MNCs put substantial efforts into long-term product standardization in order to simplify and reduce complexity in the maintenance and breakdown service process. For these reasons, elevator installers prefer to remain with selected components and suppliers. Doing so reduces failure rates and maintenance cost, improves productivity and minimizes safety risks.

This slight decrease in revenue was primarily the result of stable demand for elevator components and spare parts for modernization and maintenance projects of the installed elevator base (including a 4% increase in MNC sales by our Austria business in the nine months ended September 30, 2014) in an overall difficult macroeconomic environment, especially in the markets in Spain, Italy and Greece. In the nine months ended September 30, 2014, sales to MNCs accounted for 61.4%, of our revenue for Europe, an increase of 0.5 percentage points from 2013, and sales to Independents contributed 38.6%, compared to 39.1% in 2013. 79 ----- _Asia_ Revenue in our Asia region increased by €19.0 million, or 13.9%, to €154.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, from €135.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. This increase in revenue was primarily the result of an increase in new elevator installations, which outpaced overall GDP growth and the growth in the construction industry, particularly in China. In the nine months ended September 30, 2014, sales to MNCs accounted for 92.7% of our revenue for Asia, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points from 2013, and sales to Independents contributed 7.3%, compared to 7.1% in 2013. _Rest of World_ Revenue in our Rest of the World region increased by €3.0 million, or 6.2%, to €50.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, from €47.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. This increase in revenue was primarily the result of an increase in revenue from key emerging markets in this region, including Brazil, driven by new installations and modernization projects by both Independents and MNCs. In the nine months ended September 30, 2014, sales to MNCs accounted for 22.8% of our revenue, an increase of 1.7 percentage points from 2013, and sales to Independents contributed 77.2%, compared to 78.9% in 2013. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales increased by €11.2 million, or 4.1%, from €268.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to €280.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This increase in cost of sales was primarily due to sales growth, primarily in Asia, and was partially offset by purchasing savings, effects of our operational improvement measures and reduced cost of warranty claims. Cost of direct materials amounted to €189.9 million, or 67.8%, of our overall cost of sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, an increase of €8.4 million, or 4.6%, compared to 2013. This increase in direct material costs, consumables and merchandise was primarily the result of increased sales volumes. Prices for our key raw materials, steel, aluminium and titanium remained relatively stable. Other cost of sales, including certain labor costs and costs for freight and packaging, increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to sales growth. Our purchasing activities realized cost saving as a result of our supply chain optimization. Our operational improvement measures included the closure of our Madrid plant and the transfer of its operations to our Zaragoza plant, the transfer of productions from higher cost countries to lower cost countries, and strategic headcount reductions. _Gross Profit_ Gross profit increased by €10.4 million, or 11.5%, from €90.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, to €100.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This increase in gross profit was primarily due to the sales growth, offset by our purchasing savings, effects of our operational improvement measures and reduced cost of warranty claims. _Selling Expenses_ Selling expenses decreased by €1.0 million, or 6.8%, from €14.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, to €13.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This decrease in selling expenses was primarily due to expenses related to the biennial Interlift fairs that occurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, but not in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. _Research & Development Expenses_ Research & Development expenses increased by €0.3 million, or 7.3%, from €4.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, to €4.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased R&D activities in 2014 as compared to 2013, which was linked to the R&D function becoming more strategically aligned with the business after its reorganization in 2013, and which resulted in an increase of our R&D employee base by eleven full-time employees. Since these eleven employees were neither hired at the beginning of the period, nor all at the same time, the increase in Research & Development expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 is not reflective of the impact on our Research & Development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014. As a result, the increase in research and development expenses in 2014 mainly reflects salaries, wages and related expenses. 80 ----- _Administrative Expenses_ Administrative expenses decreased by €1.1 million, or 2.6%, from €42.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, to €41.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This decrease in administrative expenses was primarily due to the reduced depreciation of purchase price allocation assets, partially offset by increased labor costs as a result of an increase in the number of our full-time equivalent employees in 2014, allowances for bad debt relating to trade and increased IT consultancy costs. _Other Income_ Other income decreased by €0.6 million, or 30.2%, from €1.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, to €1.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This decrease in other income was primarily due to decrease in exchange gains on foreign currency transactions as a result of a weaker euro in 2014 compared to 2013. _Other Expenses_ Other expenses increased by €0.4 million, or 25.5%, from €1.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, to €1.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This increase in other expenses was primarily due to an increase in other taxes which related to education tax and city construction tax in China. _Finance Expense_ Finance expense decreased by €3.1 million, or 19.0%, from €16.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to €13.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This decrease in finance expense was primarily due to a decrease in shareholder loan interest expense as a result of our loan repayment in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2013. _Finance Income_ Finance income increased by €0.8 million, or 257.5%, from €0.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, to €1.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This increase was primarily due to the fair value adjustment on our foreign exchange hedges in 2014. _Income Taxes_ Income taxes increased by €3.6 million, or 46.0%, from €7.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, to €11.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This increase was primarily due to increased taxable income as a result of the factors described above. _Loss after Taxes for Discontinued Operations_ In the nine months ended September 30, 2013 there was a loss after taxes for discontinued operations of €0.6 million which resulted from the sale of Wittur Hydraulic Drives, based in Bagnatica, Italy, during that year. There are no such results relevant for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. _Net Result for the Period_ Net result for the period increased by €12.1 million, or 243.4%, from €5.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, to €17.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This increase was primarily a result of the factors described above. 81 -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, revenues by region include sales deductions and thus deviate from our 2013 Audited Financial Statements in which revenues by region for these years do not include sales deductions. _Europe_ Revenue in our Europe region decreased slightly by €0.6 million, or 0.3%, to €233.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, from €234.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This slight decrease in revenue was primarily the result of stable demand for elevator components and spare parts for modernization and maintenance projects of the installed elevator base in an overall difficult macroeconomic environment, especially in our markets in Italy, Spain and Greece. In year ended December 31, 2013, sales to MNCs accounted for 61.8% of our revenue for Europe, an increase of 3.8 percentage points from 2012, and sales to Independents contributed 38.2%, compared to 42.0% in 2012. 82 ----- _Asia_ Revenue in our Asia region increased by €19.7 million, or 12.3%, to €179.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, from €159.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase in revenue was primarily the result of an increase in new elevator installations which outpaced overall GDP growth and the growth in the construction industry, particularly in China. In the year ended December 31, 2013, sales to MNCs accounted for 92.3% of our revenue in Asia, and Independents contributed 7.7%. _Rest of World_ Revenue in our Rest of the World region increased by €4.8 million, or 7.8%, to €66.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, from €62.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase in revenue was primarily the result of an increase in revenue from key emerging markets in this region, including Brazil, driven by new installations and modernization projects by both Independents and MNCs. In the year ended December 31, 2013, sales to MNCs accounted for 21.5% of our revenue in our Rest of the World region, an increase of 2.1 percentage points from 2012, and sales to Independents contributed 78.5% compared to 76.4% in 2012. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales increased by €21.2 million, or 6.3%, to €357.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 from €336.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase in cost of sales was primarily due to new plant start-up costs in China, the reallocation of costs for order management and logistics functions from selling expenses to cost of sales and the reallocation of packaging costs from selling expenses to cost of sales based on improved functionality of the accounting systems in 2013. Cost of sales also increased as a result of sales growth, primarily in Asia, which was partially offset by purchasing savings as a result of the optimization of our supply chain. Cost of direct materials amounted to €240.1 million, or 67%, of our overall cost of sales in the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of €6.1 million, or 3%, compared to 2012. This increase in direct material costs, consumables and merchandise was primarily the result of increased sales volumes, partially offset by a decrease in the prices for our key raw materials, steel, aluminium and titanium. Other cost of sales, including certain labor costs and costs for packaging, increased during the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily due to sales growth, while costs for freight decreased. _Gross Profit_ Gross profit increased by €2.7 million, or 2.3%, to €121.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, from €119.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase in gross profit was primarily due to sales growth, as well as due to reduced costs resulting from our operational improvement measures, realization of additional cost savings related to our purchasing activities as a result of our supply chain optimization and lower cost relating to warranty claims. _Selling Expenses_ Selling expenses decreased by €2.5 million, or 11.4%, to €19.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, from €22.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease was primarily due to a reallocation of costs for order management and logistics functions from selling expenses to cost of sales and the reallocation of packaging costs from selling expenses to cost of sales based on improved functionality of the accounting systems in 2013. _Research & Development Expenses_ Research & Development expenses remained relatively constant at €5.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to €5.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. Research and development expenses in the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily related to product development and testing. 83 ----- _Administrative Expenses_ Administrative expenses decreased by €5.1 million, or 8.0%, to €59.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, from €64.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease in administrative expenses was primarily due to reduced costs for restructuring and one-off improvement projects. _Other Income_ Other income increased by €0.3 million, or 12.2%, to €2.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, from €2.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to significant gains on foreign currency exchange in 2013, partially offset by a reduction in tax credits received in Argentina in 2013 compared to 2012. _Other Expenses_ Other expenses decreased by €0.9 million, or 32.9%, to €1.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, from €2.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease was primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses in 2012 compared to foreign currency gains in 2013, as well as a reduction in taxes related to the charging of some taxes directly to the cost of sales. _Finance Expense_ Finance expense remained relatively constant at €21.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to €21.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. Finance expenses in 2013 consisted of shareholder loan interest expense of €11.5 million, interest on borrowings of €7.2 million and amortization of transaction costs of €1.6 million related to the financing put in place in connection with our Existing Senior Facilities. _Finance Income_ Finance income increased by €0.4 million, or 79.1%, to €0.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, from €0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to the fair value adjustment for interest derivatives. _Income Taxes_ Income taxes increased by €4.2 million, or 81.7%, to €9.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, from €5.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to reduced deferred tax credits relating to purchase price allocation depreciation and taxes incurred on our Hong Kong acquisition in 2013. Our effective tax rate decreased in the year ended December 31, 2013, due to the capitalization of deferred tax assets on loss carry-forwards in 2013. _Loss after Taxes for Discontinued Operations_ Loss after taxes for discontinued operations increased by €0.2 million, or 45.6%, to €0.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, from €0.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to the sale of Wittur Hydraulic Drives in Italy during 2013. _Net Result for the Period_ Net result for the period increased by €7.6 million to a profit of €7.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 from a loss of €0.03 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily as a result of the factors described above. 84 -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

(0.0) (0.0) 21.3 (*) The financial information as of and for the year ended December 2011 and 2012 has been derived from the 2012 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements which were prepared on the basis of German GAAP. Please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations—Differences between German GAAP and IFRS.” (#) The difference of €10.1 million in sales under German GAAP and revenue under IFRS for the year ended December 31, 2012, reflects the sale of the operations of Wittur Hydraulic Drives GmbH in 2013, which was classified as discontinued operations for purposes of the 2013 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and therefore was excluded from the presentation of revenues under IFRS, but not from the presentation of sales under German GAAP. For additional details, please see note 5.9 to the 2013 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. (†) Represents amounts that round to less than €0.1 million in each of the periods presented. _Sales_ Sales increased by €78.3 million, or 20.2%, to €466.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, from €387.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to growth in the new installation market in Europe. _Revenues by region_",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Our sales increased each year since the year ended December 31, 2004, until the year ended December 31, 2008. In the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010, our sales were lower than in the year ended December 31, 2008. Our EBITDA margin has exceeded 10% on average since 2004 due to strict cost management. Despite the decrease in sales in the years 2009 and 2010, our EBITDA margin in the year ended December 31, 2009 exceeded the value in the prior year, and our EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 was approximately equal to the value for 2008.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, revenues by region include sales deductions and thus deviate from our 2013 Audited Financial Statements in which revenues by region for this year do not include sales deductions and had been grouped differently. _Europe_ Revenue in our Europe region increased by €19.3 million, or 8.6%, from €224.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, to €244.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily the result of increased sales to MNCs in Austria and increased sales to Independents in Sweden for elevator maintenance and modernization components, which were partially offset by lower sales to Independents in Spain due to market conditions. 85 ----- _Asia_ Revenue in our Asia region increased by €53.0 million, or 49.6%, from €106.8 million in year ended December 31, 2011, to €159.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was as a result of substantial growth in sales to MNCs in Asia (primarily in China) in respect of new elevator installations. In the year ended December 31, 2012, sales to MNCs accounted for 92.3% of our revenue in Asia, and Independents contributed 7.7% of our revenue in the region. _Rest of World_ Revenue in our Rest of the World region increased by €6.0 million, or 10.7%, to €62.1 million in year ended December 31, 2012, from €56.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase in revenue was primarily the result of an increase in revenue from emerging markets in this region, including in particular Argentina and Brazil, and was driven by new installations and modernisation projects carried out by both Independents and MNCs. In the year ended December 31, 2012, sales to MNCs accounted for 23.6% of our revenue in our Rest of the world region, compared to 22.5% in 2011, and sales to Independents contributed 76.4% compared to 77.5% in 2011. _Decrease in finished goods and work in progress_ Finished goods and work in progress charge decreased by €2.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to a decrease of €3.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease in 2012 was primarily due to one-off depreciation of purchase price allocation on the fair value uplift on inventory that was included for 2011 but not in 2012. _Other operating income_ Other operating income increased by €1.2 million, or 11.9%, to €11.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, from €10.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to increased income from capitalized development costs, waste disposal and release of provisions from prior periods. _Cost of materials_ Cost of materials increased by €39.5 million, or 18.7%, to €250.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, from €210.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to increased sales volume in all regions, but primarily in Asia. However, materials as a percentage of sales decreased from 54.4% to 53.7% due to efficiency savings and reduced cost of raw materials, with the most pronounced effect in China. In China, cost of materials as a percentage of sales decreased from 71.2% to 65.4%. _Personnel expense_ Personnel expense increased, by €9.7 million, or 12.4%, to €87.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, from €78.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to increased sales volume and inflationary pay rises. However, personnel expense as a percentage of sales decreased from 20.2% in 2011 to 18.9% in 2012. _Amortization and depreciation_ Amortization and depreciation increased, by €4.0 million, or 9.2%, to €47.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, from €43.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to the higher amortization of purchase price allocation for the fair value uplift on intangibles in 2012. _Other operating expenses_ Other operating expenses increased by €17.4 million, or 25.0%, to €87.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, from €69.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to increased freight and packaging as well as production materials, expenses and building and occupancy costs. In addition, we experienced an increase in temporary production personnel, a warranty provision increase (including a change in estimate) and increased normalized consultancy and project-based costs. 86 ----- _Other and similar income_ Other and similar income increased marginally by €0.1 million, or 5.1%, to €0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, from €0.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. _Interest and similar expenses_ Interest and similar expenses increased by €0.6 million, or 3.0%, to €20.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, from €19.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to our payment in kind interest expense on our shareholder loan. _Loss on ordinary activities_ Loss on ordinary activities decreased by €11.3 million, or 42.1%, to a loss of €15.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, from a loss of €26.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease was due to the factors described above. _Taxes on income_ Taxes on income increased by €3.2 million, or 94.0%, to €6.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, from €3.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to an increase in taxable income. _Other taxes_ Other taxes increased by €1.2 million, or 110.7%, to €2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, from €1.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to a one off value added tax (“VAT”) audit impact in Germany for non-recoverable VAT in the year ended December 31, 2012. _Consolidated net loss for the year_ Consolidated net loss for the year decreased by €6.9 million, or 22.1%, to €24.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, from €31.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease was due to the factors described above. 87 -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Following the Completion Date, our principal source of liquidity is expected to be our cashflows from operations, as well as drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility. We will use the proceeds from the Offering of the Notes together with the proceeds of the New Term Loan B Facility and the Equity Contribution to fund the consideration payable for the shares of the Target, repay all amounts outstanding under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and certain other debt of the Target’s subsidiaries and pay the estimated fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds,” Our ability to generate sufficient cash for our ongoing operations depends on our operating performance, which in turn depends to some extent on general economic, financial, industry, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in “Risk Factors.” We believe that, based on our current level of operations as reflected in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013, our cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand and the availability of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital expenditures and debt service for at least the next 12 months. Until the Completion Date, we will have access to funds under our Existing Senior Facilities. Following the Completion Date, we will have access to funds under our Senior Facilities. The availability of the Senior Facilities, including the Revolving Credit Facility, will be subject to certain conditions. We anticipate that we will be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future, and under certain circumstances, obligated to comply with a financial maintenance covenant. Our high level of debt may have important negative consequences for you. See “Risk Factors.” There are also limitations on our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities.” In addition, any additional indebtedness that we do incur could reduce the amount of our cash flow available to make payments on our then existing indebtedness, including under the Notes offered hereby, and increase our leverage. 88 -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Currently, the only authorized means of intercompany borrowing is by way of an entrustment loan using an international bank as entrustment facilitator. In 2013, the Target, as borrower, entered into an entrustment loan agreement with Wittur China, as lender, and Commerzbank Shanghai, as entrustment facilitator, pursuant to which several tranches of loans up to an aggregate of RMB 150.0 million can be drawn. Under the entrustment loan agreement, Wittur China makes a payment to Commerzbank Shanghai which in turn transfers the funds received to the Target’s RMB-denominated account with Commerzbank Frankfurt, where the funds are translated into euro. Commerzbank Shanghai does not assume any loan risk but collects certain handling charges and the entrustment loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.2%, which is set by the People’s Bank of China. Pursuant to the entrustment loan agreement, the Target can repay outstanding loans at any time, and we constantly monitor the liquidity requirements of Wittur China and respond to any liquidity shortfalls through repayments of outstanding entrustment loans. The entrustment loan arrangement is currently scheduled to expire in 2018. As of September 30, 2014, €12.8 million had been drawn under the entrustment loan.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

This increase was primarily due to increased earnings before tax and reduced interest expense and depreciation charges. Net cash flow from operating activities Net cash flow from operating activities increased by €11.5 million, or 31.4%, to €48.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, from €36.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The increase was primarily due to lower working capital requirements as a result of seasonal fluctuations in supplier payments at the end of the third quarter due to a holiday in China, partially offset by higher income taxes paid. 90 ----- Net cash flow used in investing activities Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased by €0.5 million, or 12.0%, to €3.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, from €4.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. This decrease was primarily due to the completion of our plant in Slovakia, which had increased purchase of property, plant & equipment in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. In the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we incurred capital expenditures of €5.3 million, of which we incurred €4.3 million in our Europe region, €0.6 million in our Asia region and €0.4 million in our Rest of the World region, mainly related to investments in property, plant, and equipment as well as intangibles. In the nine months ended September 30, 2013, we incurred capital expenditures of €5.7 million, of which we incurred €2.4 million in our Europe region, €2.5 million in our Asia region and €0.7 million in our Rest of the World region. Capital expenditure in Asia in 2013 mainly results from our investments in our new plant in China in connection with our expansion in the Chinese market. Net cash flow used in financing activities Net cash flow used in financing activities increased by €10.8 million, or 59.1%, to €29.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, from €18.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. This increase was primarily due to the repayment of our ancillary bank facility in January 2014. _Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013_ Cash generated from operations (excluding working capital changes) Cash generated from operations (excluding working capital changes) increased by €10.5 million, or 20.9%, to €60.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, from €50.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to increased earnings before tax. These increased earnings before tax were a result of increased gross profit from higher sales volumes, improved operational efficiency and purchasing savings and reduced administrative expenses, primarily due to reduced costs for restructuring and one-off improvement projects. Net cash flow from operating activities Net cash flow from operating activities decreased by €3.9 million, or 10.1%, to €34.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, from €38.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease was mainly due to increased working capital requirements as a result of delayed cash receipts from customers, as well as the early payment of supplier invoices in December 2013. Net cash flow used in investing activities Net cash flow used in investing activities increased by €2.1 million, or 22.2%, to €11.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, from €9.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease was primarily due to the expansion of our plant in China which opened in the second quarter 2013. Net cash flow used in financing activities Net cash flow used in financing activities decreased by €1.2 million, or 4.7%, to €25.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2013, from €26.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease was primarily due to the drawdown of our ancillary bank facility in December 2013, which we used as a cash bridge while we were awaiting the currency conversion of borrowings under our China entrustment loan from Chinese renminbi to euro, partially offset by the cost of refinancing fees associated with the implementation of a new term loan C under our Existing Senior Facilities, which we used to partially repay outstanding shareholder loans. 91 ----- _Cash Flows the Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2012_ The following table shows the cash flow statement on the basis of German GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012 and the year-to-year changes in these cash flows:",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

433,Offerings 2015.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.57,Critical Accounting Policies,17.57.1,General Provisions,"The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. The assumptions and estimates principally relate to the consolidation of business combinations, the assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amount of intangible assets (in particular goodwill), the groupwide determination of useful lives of material assets, taxation and the recognition of deferred tax assets and the measurement and recognition of provisions for pensions and other provisions. Assumptions and estimates are based on premises derived from knowledge at the time. Within the scope of business combinations, general estimates are also made when determining the fair values of the assets acquired. In principle fair value is determined based on the prognosis of future cash flow. _Economic Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets_ The applied economic lives of non-current assets are based on estimates of the management. We review the estimated economic useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at the end of every financial year. _Taxation_ The Target and its subsidiaries are subject to routine tax audits and also a process whereby tax computations are discussed and agreed with the respective authorities. While the ultimate outcome of such tax audits and discussions cannot be determined with certainty, management estimates the level of provisions required for both current and deferred tax on the basis of professional advice and the nature of current discussions with the tax authority concerned. _Estimates and Assumptions_ The key assumptions concerning the future economic situation and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. _Impairment of Non-Financial Assets_ We assess whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting date. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and at other times when such indicators exist. Other non-financial assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. _Deferred Tax Assets_ Management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future tax planning strategies. 95 ----- _Fair Value of Financial Instruments_ We measure financial instruments, such as, derivatives, and non-financial assets such as investment properties, at fair value at each balance sheet date. Also, fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in Note 7 Additional disclosures on financial instruments to the 2013 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. We use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. The fair values of the derivatives are presented in the balance sheet on a gross basis. _Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits_ The carrying amount of defined benefit pensions plans and other post-employment benefits are based on actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuations involved making assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. _Other Provisions_ Such provisions are recognized when it is considered probable that economical, legal, ecological and decommissioning obligations will result in future outflows of economic benefits, when the costs can be estimated reliably and the measures in question are not expected to result in future inflows of economic benefits. The estimate of future costs is subject to many uncertainties, including legal uncertainties based on the applicable laws and regulations and with uncertainties regarding to the actual conditions in the different countries and operating locations. In particular, estimates of costs are based on earlier experiences in similar cases, the conclusions of expert opinions commissioned by us, current costs and new developments that have a bearing on the costs. Any changes to these estimates could have an impact on our future results.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Such assumptions and estimates are based on factors such as historical experience, the observance of trends in the industries in which we operate and information available from our customers and other outside sources. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making assumptions and estimates, actual outcomes could differ from those assumptions and estimates.

However, prior to the adoption of the German Accounting Modernization Act (Bilanzrechtsmoderinsierungsgesetz) in 2010, German GAAP allowed the application of the book value method and this method was used to account for the acquisition of the Group in 2007. Therefore, the complete difference between the acquisition costs and the proportionate equity share acquired was recognized as goodwill in the German GAAP consolidated financial statements of the Group. As a result, no fair value adjustments regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized and the resulting goodwill recognized under German GAAP differs from the goodwill which would have been recognized under IFRS. Under IFRS, transaction costs related to the acquisition are immediately recognized as an expense. Under German GAAP certain costs directly attributable to the acquisition can be capitalized as goodwill along with the purchase price.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or group of assets. If this is the case, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs, unless either the asset’s fair value less costs of disposal is higher than its carrying amount; or the asset’s value in use can be estimated to be close to its fair value less costs of disposal and fair value less costs of disposal can be measured. Under German GAAP, an impairment loss for long-lived assets must only be recorded if a permanent impairment in value is anticipated. An impairment loss is recognized under German GAAP if the fair value less cost to sell is permanently expected to be lower than the carrying amount of an asset. The concept of cash generating units is not applicable under German GAAP, and impairment loss is determined on an item-by-item basis. _Amortization, depreciation and impairment on intangible and tangible assets_ Under IFRS and German GAAP, amortization and depreciation are based on the useful life of the asset. However, under German GAAP all intangible and tangible assets are subject to amortization and depreciation, 97 ----- whereas under IFRS intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not amortized but are only subject to an impairment test which is at least performed on an annual basis.

A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of leased assets. Title may or may not eventually be transferred. For a finance lease, the lessee recognizes an asset and a liability at an amount equal to the lower of the fair value of leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The discount rate to be used in calculating the present value of the minimum lease payments is the interest rate implicit in the lease, if this is practicable to determine; if not, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate shall be used. Any initial direct costs of the lessee are added to the amount recognized as an asset. Operating leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern of the user’s benefit. Under German GAAP, accounting for leases is primarily due to certain decrees of the Federal Ministry of Finance, to determine whether capitalization at the lessee level is required. These rules differ from IFRS rules in several respects. Some leases specified as operating lease under German GAAP may qualify as a finance lease under IFRS.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Under IFRS it is required to use the projected unit credit method to determine the present value of the entity’s defined benefit obligation, whereas under German GAAP the use of the projected unit credit method is only one of the permissible actuarial valuation methods. We use the tax driven entry age normal method as the actuarial method to calculate our pension liabilities. A major difference between German GAAP and IFRS is the discount rate used to discount post-employment benefit obligations. Under IFRS the discount rate is determined by reference to market yields of high quality corporate bonds at the end of the reporting period. Under German GAAP the determination of the discount is determined on the average market yields for the past seven years. Under German GAAP, all changes in the pension liability are recognized in the income statement, whereas under IFRS certain changes in the pension liability are recognized in the other comprehensive income. The amount which has to be accounted for as a liability from a defined benefit plan equals of the cash value of the defined benefit pension obligation, less the fair value of the plan assets which exist for the direct fulfillment of the obligation.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Under German GAAP, the criteria for the recognition of provisions and contingencies are less detailed and prescriptive than under IFRS. Provisions must be carried at the amount required to settle the obligation based on sound business judgment in accordance with the principle of a prudent businessman.

Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings or as separate component of equity, depending on whether a derivative is designated as a part of a hedge transaction and the type of the hedge transaction. 98 ----- Under German GAAP, there is no distinction in the accounting treatment between fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. If a derivative financial instrument and its related underlying instrument are designated as a hedge for a particular risk exposure (“Valuation Unit”), and the hedge is considered to be effective, the changes of the fair value of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are netted in the income statement line of the hedged items. Therefore, the effective portion of the hedged item and the hedging instrument remains unrecognized. However, under German GAAP a provision for anticipated contract losses is recognized for the portion of the negative market values of the interest rate swaps exceeding the underlying transactions as well as for the ineffective portion of the Valuation Units. Unrealized gains are not recognized under German GAAP. If the liabilities to banks relate to floating rate interest-bearing loans, respective swaps are entered into to fix the interest rates. If the requirements are met, hedging instruments and hedged items are combined to form a Valuation Unit and are accounted for using the net hedge presentation method. In accordance with the net hedge presentation method, the effective portion of the hedged item and the hedging instrument remains unrecognized as long as the hedge is effective. The hedge effectiveness is determined by means of the dollar-offset-method.

The elevator market can be broken down into three major sub-segments: components (43% of the market); value added on components by elevator installer (13%); and installation, maintenance and modernization services (44%) (source: _Global consulting firm). According to a Global consulting firm, demand for elevator units grew more quickly_ than construction demand and real GDP from 1996 to 2012: during this period the World real GDP grew at a CAGR of 3.0%; and the World construction demand at a CAGR of 4.3%, whereas the world unit (real) elevator demand grew at a CAGR of 9.5%. Elevators as such have been growing in excess of GDP over many decades, with penetration increasing. Elevator growth has been more gradual in more mature regions (sales in those regions are driven by demand for modernization and maintenance of the installed elevator base), and more rapid in emerging markets (driven by strong demand for new installations of elevators). Elevators are a key part of the functionality of a building. However, they represent only a small portion of the total building construction costs. The core business of elevator companies is the development, installation and servicing of elevators, as well as the production of some of the components. A significant portion of component manufacturing is outsourced by elevator companies to independent suppliers, such as Wittur. We estimate that as of December 31, 2014, approximately 55% of the total components market for doors and drives was outsourced to suppliers, as opposed to 45% produced in-house by MNCs. Our industry has exhibited a trend towards outsourcing in the past, which is expected to continue in the future, driven by MNCs and others focusing on the installation and service business. Our addressable market is estimated to amount to €8.68 billion in 2014 (as calculated by comparing the €27.7 billion total components market, with our core products covering a product spectrum that represented 57% at an outsourcing share of 55%) (source: Global consulting firm). 100 ----- The following chart sets forth the structure and segmentation of the elevator market.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Slings, cars and safeties are estimated to account for 11%, 10% and 3%, respectively, of revenues, while the remaining 31% of revenues mainly includes car frames, counterweight frames, shaft equipment, suspensions and others (Source: Global consulting firm). _Elevator type. Low rise elevators were estimated to represent close to half of the total market (49%) in 2014,_ while mid-rise elevators are estimated at 38% and high-rise elevators at 13% of the total market, respectively. High-rise elevators represent the most value added in terms of technology and are expected to experience the strongest growth in the coming years on the back of demographic changes affecting building engineering (Source: Global consulting firm). _Geography. As of September 30, 2014, China was the largest market for elevator components, with an_ estimated share of 53% of total revenues. The size of the Chinese market is primarily driven by strong volume expansion on the back of ongoing urbanization, increasing floor space per capita driven by higher GDP per capita, increasing population density and thus more vertical construction in urban areas. The second largest market for elevator components is Europe and Africa with an estimated share of 18% of total revenues (although still having the largest installed base as of today) followed by Asia Pacific excluding China (estimated at 16%), Americas (estimated at 7%) and Eurasia (estimated at 5%) (Source: Global consulting firm). _Project type. New installations comprise most of the total components market, with an estimated total share_ of 76% in 2014, mainly due to rapid construction growth in China. Modernization is estimated at 24% of the total components market and is mainly sustained by a sizeable aging installed base in traditional economies (i.e., Europe), but in the future increasingly also by China (Source: Global consulting firm). _Customers. Western MNCs were estimated to account for approximately 43% of the market in 2012, Asian_ MNCs for around an estimated 18% while the remaining approximately 39% is estimated for Independents (Source: Global consulting firm). _Outsourcing.

(Source: KONE investor presentation. Based on 2012 installed fleet). Mature markets, such as Europe, are characterized by an installed base with a lifecycle of up to 40 years. In Europe, mostly elevators within the high performance segment are installed. Installed elevators require smaller repairs and modernization over time to ensure such exceptionally long life cycles. Whenever such measures are required, Wittur will typically be the supplier of choice for spare parts of components Wittur has supplied when the elevator has been installed in the first instance. In comparison, the average life cycle of Chinese elevators is lower, resulting in a faster demand for major modernizations or already a full replacement compared to Europe. Currently, the installed base in Europe and the United States are both equally split between elevators younger than 20 years and those with a life span already exceeding 20 years. The installed base in China consists almost solely of elevators and components younger than 20 years. As this installed base continues to age, further modernization demand should develop. In addition, whereas the installed base in Europe is expected to grow fairly slowly, the installed base in China is expected to more than double in coming years (source: Global _consulting firm). This expanding base further increases the potential for further modernization demand._ Higher regulation and changing safety norms are a key driver of modernization demand. The most relevant norm in Europe, the EN81-1/2, has been implemented in the 1980s, but is going to be replaced by the new EN 81-20/50, which was introduced in July 2014, and is being implemented subject to a transition period through July 2017. As has been the case in the past, other countries and regions are expected to follow this newly introduced norm in the upcoming and change respective norms subsequently. These changes are expected to trigger substantial future demand for modernization globally. Resulting from the aforementioned number of individual growth drivers, modernization and spare parts evolution is expected to grow and the respective market to increase in size faster than in the past. The modernization rate is expected to further boost demand for components on the back of an increasingly aging installed base, demanding regulation and safety standards and energy efficiency requirements. 110 -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Some outsourcing decisions, for instance, involve the sale of the MNC’s production facility to a supplier which was the case in our acquisition of our production facility in Scheibbs, Austria, from Kone. In these circumstances, the MNC no longer has the requisite manufacturing facilities to produce the components. Moreover, when exploring and penetrating fast-growing emerging markets MNCs typically rely on the installed capacity base of their suppliers. In addition, outsourcing generally entails lower requirements for capital assets and reduced capital expenditures for MNCs and thereby allows them to operate on a leaner cost base. Another key obstacle to MNCs’ reintegration of component manufacturing is that they typically transfer their R&D and innovation capabilities along with their business pursuant to their outsourcing decision. As suppliers, such as Wittur, receive these capabilities from several MNCs, they can pool these resources, thereby becoming more advanced in their technology than any MNC on a standalone basis and thus more competitive than MNCs. Further, MNCs typically only produce components for their own business, whereas suppliers market and sell their products to all MNCs as well as Independents, which provides them with greater economies of scale, so that insourcing would create a cost disadvantage for the MNC. Moreover, outsourcing in the elevator components industry is usually a strategic long-term decision because it involves the entirety of an MNC’s production volume rather than merely peak volumes exceeding their in-house capacity. Lastly, some MNCs are contractually barred from re-entering the components industry due to volume share agreements entered into between the MNC and its supplier.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

According to certain expert interviews carried out by a global consulting firm, different elevator companies have adopted different outsourcing strategies, mainly due to (i) different strategic approaches as it relates to their core business, (ii) differences in their historic/existing production footprint and (iii) different strategies for and focus on new emerging markets: - Western MNCs generally have the highest proportion of outsourced components among MNCs and are showing the strongest upward trend further sustained by increasing standardization of platforms, which enables them to reduce complexity and cost of their own product offering. The outsourcing rates among the ‘Big 4’ participants remain similar to date, though Kone has outsourced the most over time (source: Expert interviews, Global consulting firm). - Asian MNCs have historically been more reluctant to significantly outsource production and are not expected to drastically change this strategy in the near future. However, Asian MNCs are expected to outsource some business in markets they are targeting outside their traditional home markets (e.g., India, South East Asia and potentially China) (source: Expert interviews, Global consulting firm). - Independents tend to outsource the largest portion of component modules, mainly due to lack of scale and in-house production capabilities. Outsourcing is expected to continue, in particular on the back of the increasing complexity of products and more restrictive standards and norms. Going forward, leading Independents are expected to require further support by strong suppliers, which are able to provide them with tailored solutions complying with increasingly stringent local regulations (source: _Expert interviews, Global consulting firm)._ 111 ----- The elevator components industry lags behind the automotive industry in terms of share of components outsourced, but has historically followed a similar trend.

The elevator components industry is characterized by long-term growth and resilience during economic downturns due to a number of favorable factors. Demand for elevators has grown significantly faster than GDP due to a number of favorable global trends, such as population growth, urbanization, taller buildings, aging populations, increased wealth and increased regulation and safety awareness. As a manufacturer of elevator components operating independently from elevator installers, we also benefit from the trend of elevator installers increasingly seeking to outsource the manufacture of components, which has increased the rate of growth for elevator components manufacturers above the growth in demand for elevators. Our position as the leading independent elevator components manufacturer has enabled us to capitalize on these growth trends, as evidenced by our strong long-term revenue growth and EBITDA margins in excess of 10% on average since 2004. We are a global manufacturer of elevator components with a strong footprint across multiple regions. We divide our operations into three geographical regions which include Europe, Asia and the Rest of the World. Our Europe region includes our operations in Africa and represents our core market, accounting for 48.6% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2013, with upside potential as Southern European economies recover. Our Asia region provides the growth engine for our business, with 37.4% of our revenue, driven by increased urbanization and other favorable trends in China, and with the potential to grow spare parts sales in China as the market matures. Our Rest of the World region primarily includes Eurasia, Turkey, the Middle East and Latin America and represented 13.9% of our revenue, with the potential for significant future growth. Our product offering features a large range of elevator components for new elevator manufacturing and sourcing, for spare parts and for modernization and upgrades. Our components span from sophisticated mechatronic components for elevator cabin and landing doors (including the associated opening mechanisms) to other critical components such as gearless drives, slings, safety gears and cars. We also offer complete elevators, which we primarily sell to independent elevator installers (“Independents”). Sales of doors and door components accounted for 69% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2013. Doors and door components are required at each floor of a building, so as the average height of new buildings increases, the demand for elevator doors and door components also increases at a faster rate than demand for other components. Doors and door components range from relatively standardized, high-volume production doors to highly customized, special-order doors—we offer 19 models of landing doors and 15 models of elevator car doors. Having produced approximately 1.2 million doors and door components in the year ended December 31, 2013, we believe we are the leading elevator door and door components supplier in a highly fragmented elevator components market. We manufacture components for both the original equipment market and the aftermarket. We estimate that the original equipment market makes up a larger percentage of our business in developing countries, such as China, while the aftermarket makes up approximately 50% of our sales in a mature market such as Europe. Aftermarket sales range from routine provision of spare parts through the lifetime of an elevator, to components for modernization and upgrade of an elevator, to complete replacement of an elevator. In developing markets such as China, we expect aftermarket components sales to strongly increase as the life cycle of newly-installed elevators progresses. Our key customers are global, multinational corporation elevator installers (“MNCs”), such as westernbased MNCs Kone, Otis, Schindler and ThyssenKrupp Elevator (“Western MNCs”) and Asian-based MNCs Fujitec, Hitachi, Hyundai, Mitsubishi Electric and Toshiba (“Asian MNCs”), as well as Independents, which are typically active in a limited geographic market.

We have long-standing relationships with each of these customers, which we have maintained over the past 15 to 30 years. These long-standing relationships have allowed us to better understand our customers’ needs and priorities, thereby enabling us to cater to our customers from conception, design and development to manufacturing and distribution of components to offering comprehensive after-sale services and technical support. MNCs put substantial efforts in long-term product standardization in order to simplify and reduce complexity in the maintenance and breakdown service process. In addition, elevator certification and safety regulations mean that changing components suppliers can add additional compliance costs. For these reasons, elevator installers prefer to remain with selected components and suppliers. Doing so reduces failure rates and maintenance cost, improves productivity and minimizes safety risks. The result has been that our MNC customers engage with us to deliver on their most complex and important projects, and rely on us as their partner of choice in a manner that would be difficult for a competitor to replicate.

We have seven R&D centers that focus on performance improvements, weight reduction, energy efficiency, reliability, maintenance reduction, installation speed and adjustability to new industry norms. We also hold more than 300 patents. We also cooperate with major universities, providing us access to innovative new technologies at an early stage. In addition, we have established a close interlink between our R&D department and our product certification team, thereby ensuring not only a short lead time for required certifications for new product innovations, but also allowing for quick responses to new regulatory standards. Our R&D work focuses on a “mechatronic” (the combination of mechanical and electrical engineering) design approach, which enables us to develop intelligent components with monitoring and diagnostic capabilities, and optimizes installation time. As a result, the individual life cycle of our components is prolonged, which further supports our customers’ profitability, and therefore their loyalty to us. 116 -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

For example, we recently entered into binding, multi-year “share-of-wallet” agreements with Schindler, as well as with Kone. We are also in active dialogue with other MNCs, including Asian MNCs, who have historically outsourced less of their elevator components demand than Western MNCs, and intend to more substantially diversify our customer mix by developing relationships with other Western MNCs. Over the past twelve months, we have received an increasing number of requests for quotes for new business from Asian MNCs, validating this strategy.

In Latin America, we intend to grow our business on the back of strong end market growth and to benefit from our new plant in Brazil. In India, which made up approximately 5% of all new elevator installations in 2013, and in Southeast Asia, we see attractive, growth driven end-markets for elevator components, and the opportunity to sell to both MNCs and Independents operating in those markets. Our view is that these markets are on the cusp of a strong phase of growth in demand for elevators, akin to that in China in recent years. To exploit these opportunities, we have increased our sales forces in these regions and are working to increase local market penetration, so we already have a strong base by which we will be able to quickly respond to growing demand. We also intend to continue to utilize our strategy of locating our plants in low cost countries where we benefit from labor cost efficiencies and close proximity to customers.

We supply customers across all market segments with solutions ranging from standardized doors to highly customized, bespoke door applications with different combinations of performance and technical functionality. As of September 30, 2014, our door product range included 19 different models of landing doors and 15 different models of car doors, available for all applications and geographies. Different models are designed to accommodate distinctive customer needs in terms of traffic flows and sizes (including different speeds, as well as traffic flows and elevator loads ranging from 250 kilograms to 10,000 kilograms). Standard installations are available for residential buildings and modernization projects, while a broad set of customizations is available to meet specific customer demands. Doors are the leading reason for unscheduled maintenance calls, accounting for what one of our customers has estimated to be 40% of maintenance activities. Given elevator installers’ focus on service, high reliability and a low degree of maintenance are key to elevator installers’ ability to differentiate themselves from their competitors. This factor benefits our business due to our focus on high quality and reliability. Moreover, despite their relevance to maintenance costs, doors only account for between 14% and 21% of the total cost of an elevator, so elevator installers may be less likely to compromise quality over price.

We believe that Western MNCs accounted for approximately 43% of total revenue in the elevator industry in 2013. We manage these key customers through dedicated key account managers. Our close monitoring and management of our key customers enables us to meet their high expectations for quality and production process execution. During the past five years, we have negotiated framework contracts and supply agreements with Kone, Schindler and ThyssenKrupp Elevator, which typically run for a term of three years. We believe that through our quick response time and high quality of service we are able to meet our key customers’ high expectations in part due to global presence, which allows us to provide services and supplies on a local level. This global presence, combined with the engineering, quality and sales leadership that we offer, we are able to meet the market demands of our MNC customers. Some of our contracts include “share-of-wallet” volume share undertakings with a term until 2016. These contracts constitute legal commitments by our customers to guarantee a minimum “share-of-wallet” for their product requirements to us, meaning that we provide a specified percentage of all of their requirements for certain specified products. Pursuant to these agreements, MNCs typically share their order intake and production forecasts with us, which improves the visibility on future volumes in the short and medium term. Services are the most profitable part of elevator installers’ business and, as a result, the reliability of components is key to their profitability. Elevator installers enter into service and maintenance agreements with their customers when they newly install elevators or modernize existing elevators. These agreements typically take one of two forms, depending on whether the customer opts for a standard or premium service agreement. The standard type of service agreement is an all-inclusive contract pursuant to which the customer pays a fixed fee for inspection, maintenance and repair, minus penalties for any periods during which the elevator experiences downtime. The premium service agreement likewise provides for a fixed fee for periodic inspections but the elevator installer can additionally claim an hourly rate and materials costs for repairs, plus a mark-up on these costs. As a result, both types of service agreement incentivize elevator installers to use high quality, premium components to maximize their profits, due to the all-in fee under the standard contract and the cost mark-up 121 ----- under the premium contract. The penalties for downtime further increase the installer’s incentive to use high quality components because its all-in fee gets reduced as a function of the length and frequency of downtime, both of which can be minimized through the use of higher quality components. Due to these penalties elevator installers also attach high value to their suppliers’ ability to delivery components quickly and reliably. This further benefits our business because we believe our delivery times are among the best in our industry. In addition, we believe that MNCs benefit from limiting their suppliers, which benefits our position as an established and trusted supplier. We estimate that MNCs typically take approximately eight months to enter into a relationship with a new supplier, taking into account the process of searching for eligible suppliers, evaluating competitors, contract negotiation and the qualification of that supplier’s specific components and maintenance manuals. By contrast, MNCs can create important efficiencies by building long-standing relationships with a select few trusted suppliers. These efficiently include greater economies of scale in training of suppliers, simpler servicing due to a higher degree of product standardization and guaranteed capacity at their suppliers for their requirements due to long-term contracts. We believe that these reasons account, in part, for our long-standing relationship with all our key MNCs. We have had a relationship with Kone for more than 15 years, and our relationships with Schindler, Otis and ThyssenKrupp Elevator date back to the 1980s. Our long-standing relationships with our key customers and our collaborative work with them throughout the value chain from the conception, design, development, manufacturing and distribution of products to offering a comprehensive portfolio of after-sale services and technical support have allowed us to develop a deep understanding of our customers’ needs, as well as the experience to supply appropriate solutions.

In the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we spent €6.3 million on R&D, of which €1.6 million was capitalized. In 2013, we spent €7.6 million on R&D, of which €1.8 million was capitalized. In 2013, we increased our focus on R&D and introduced both a new global R&D unit and a new global R&D director to improve product development focus, better coordinate resources and global know-how and eliminate duplicative work. Our teams are supported by leading testing infrastructure, with dedicated laboratories for doors, drives and safeties. We also systematically analyze competitor products to improve our own products. Furthermore, existing test towers in Austria, China, Germany and Spain (currently under construction), also give us a key advantage as an independent component manufacturer. We have eight R&D centers that focus on performance improvements, weight reduction, energy efficiency, reliability, maintenance reduction, installation speed and adjustability to new industry norms and regulations. We also hold more than 300 patents. We have a network focused on global cooperation with major universities that gives us access to innovative new technologies at an early stage. In addition, we have established a close interlink between our R&D department and our product certification team, thereby ensuring not only a short lead time for required certifications for new product innovations, but also allowing for very quick responses to new regulatory standards. Our R&D work focuses on a “mechatronic” (the combination of mechanical and electrical engineering) design approach, which enables us to develop intelligent components with monitoring and diagnostic capabilities, and optimizes installation time.

Article 101 TFEU generally prohibits and declares void any agreement or concerted actions among companies which adversely affect competition, in particular if they lead to the formation of cartels or anticompetitive foreclosure. The abuse of a dominant position is prohibited by Article 102 TFEU. These provisions apply to horizontal cooperation (i.e. cooperation between competitors) as well as to vertical cooperations (i.e. cooperation within the production chain). The forms of cooperation subject to these provisions can include cooperation agreements, licensing agreements, distribution agreements or joint ventures. Under specific conditions, certain forms of cooperation are exempted from antitrust provisions or may be approved upon application if they contribute to improving the production or distribution of goods or to promoting technical or economic progress, while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit. Mergers and acquisitions exceeding a certain threshold are therefore subject to approval by the European Commission. Failing approval these acquisition agreements are void. Consequently, the Acquisition Agreement has been submitted to the competent anti-trust authorities. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—The Acquisition is subject to significant uncertainties and risks.” Anti-competitive behavior is subject to fines and penalties. We are also subject to the state aid rules, particularly those set forth in Articles 107 and 108 TFEU. Government support granted to the Wittur Group, whether in the form of grants, tax allowances, public loans, guarantees or any form whatsoever, is considered state aid within the meaning of Articles 107 and 107 TFEU and must be in compliance with the requirements set forth therein. Where such state aid has been granted in breach of procedural and/or substantive requirements, this government support is illegal. Any breach of European Union state aid law may lead to recovery of the sums received. Such recovery may be ordered by the granting authority itself or by competitors bringing actions for recovery before the national courts. Foreign trade provisions are mainly imposed on EU level as the European Union Treaties include the Common Commercial Policy which does not leave any further competence in this area to the Member States, Art. 3 (1) e) TFEU. As a general rule, import and export is not restricted except for certain products for safety, security of supply or environmental reasons. For instance, dual-use products are subject to Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of May 5, 2009 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items (“Dual-Use Regulation”) as last amended by Regulation (EU) No 599/2014. Apart from the permanent trade control provisions, economic sanctions may be imposed pursuant to Art. 215 TFEU by Council decisions which determine the transactions, products, entities and/or persons affected. These decisions are in general implemented by Council Regulations which are directly applicable in the Member States.

A major difference as compared to other jurisdictions in the EU is that none of the 128 ----- Official Parties has any decision making power—instead they act as a state prosecutor, bringing cases to the Higher Regional Court of Vienna acting as the Cartel Court (Oberlandesgericht Wien als Kartellgericht). The Cartel Court then decides whether there has been a breach of the law and issues a fully reasoned decision. The Official Parties propose a penalty to be imposed; however, it is up to the Cartel Court to decide upon the level of the penalty. Furthermore, for concentrations which do not fall within the scope of the EU merger control, the Austrian Cartel Act provides for a merger control regime, the applicability of which depends on meeting certain worldwide and domestic turnover thresholds.

The Lift Directive provides for essential health and safety requirements for lifts and safety components for lifts and harmonizes the respective product standards. Products having passed a conformity assessment with regard to the essential health and safety requirements in one Member State are marked with the CE-mark applicable in all other Member States unless they present a risk to the safety of persons or, where appropriate, to property. When applying harmonized standards officially published by the Commission, there is a presumption of conformity with the essential health and safety requirements. Although the Lift Directive sets only a minimum standard as regards product requirements, the Member States are not entitled to provide for stricter technical requirements than those laid down in the Lift Directive if they require the lifts to be modified in a way not specified by the Lift Directive. However, they may provide for additional requirements concerning the use of the lift provided there is no impact on the technical requirements. The directive had to be transposed into national law (“National Implementing Measures”). On February 26, 2014 a recast of the Lift directive was adopted. The new Lift Directive sets out specific obligations for the manufacturer, the distributor and the installer of lifts and lift components. Additionally, the conformity assessment procedure has been harmonized and is applicable in every Member State. Market surveillance mechanisms have been strengthened and harmonized. However, it still remains up to the Member States to implement their own and effective penalty system including fines, administrative and even criminal sanctions if necessary, in order to deter non-compliance with the essential health and safety requirements as well as non-compliance with the regime governing the CE marking. Directive 2014/33/EU on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to lifts and safety components for lifts has to be transposed into national law by April 19, 2016. Those measures shall apply from April 20, 2016. On that same day, the current Lift Directive will be repealed. Escalators, moving walkways as well as stair lifts and lifting devices for the disabled do not fall under the scope of the Lift Directive. As regards these products, the essential health and safety requirements are set out in the Directive 2006/42/EC (“Machine Directive”). The Machine Directive already provides, and the new Lift Directive will provide, for similar procedures as regards the conformity assessment and the market surveillance mechanisms, as both directives are based on the so-called New Legislative Framework on Product Safety creating an integrated framework for European Union Product Regulation applicable to all harmonized products. Technical specifications providing means of satisfying the aforementioned essential health and safety requirements are available in harmonized European Standards (issued by the European Committee for Standardization—“CEN”).

According to the Regulations and certain specific provisions promulgated by the Supervision Bureau, all elevator safety component manufacturers must obtain a “Special Equipment Manufacturing Permit” from the China Special Equipment Inspection and Research Institute (the “Research Institute”), which is a subordinate organization of the Supervision Bureau, in order to produce and sell any elevator safety components. In order to apply for such permit, the elevator component manufacturers must submit sample equipment along with its application to the Research Institute for inspection and other analysis. Once the manufacturer and the respective elevator components pass the examination and are officially recorded in the Research Institute’s files, the manufacturer is deemed to have obtained the aforementioned special equipment manufacturing permit. Once the manufacturer obtains such permit, the elevator components that have passed the inspection will be considered licensed products that are fit for large-scale production and sales in China. It is important to note that manufacturers that engage in the production of elevator safety components without a valid permit can be assessed a maximum penalty of RMB 300,000 by the Supervision Bureau. Manufacturing products without such permit may also be deemed a criminal offense. We also manufacture other elevator components in China, including elevator cars, car slings and inverters. In China, such components are not considered “special equipment,” therefore, we are not required to obtain a special equipment manufacturing permit in order to produce and sell these components in China. _Maintenance and Repair_ On June 29, 2013, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress promulgated the PRC Special Equipment Safety Law, which became effective on January 1, 2014.

No more than one Midco Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect to the same event or set of circumstances, or (ii) in any period of 365 days. Any failure to make a payment due under the Midco Finance Documents or Midco Proceeds Loan Agreement as a result of the issue of a Midco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Midco Finance Document or Midco Proceeds Loan Agreement; or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice in respect of an event of default in respect of a Midco Facility or Midco Notes (a “Midco Enforcement Notice”) on behalf of the Midco Creditors. _Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_ No Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under any Midco Finance Document or Midco Proceeds Loan Agreement by the operation of the provisions set out under each section above under the caption “—Restrictions relating to Midco Notes” even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of those provisions.

This restriction shall not apply if such amendment or waiver relates to an increase in the applicable margin or coupon payable on the relevant Midco Proceeds Loan Agreement (provided that such margin or coupon (as the case may be) may be higher than the margin or coupon payable on the relevant Midco Facility or Midco Notes to which the Midco Proceeds Loan Agreement relates) to the extent it is customary for such Midco Proceeds Loan Agreement at the date of borrowing or issuance thereunder, taking into account the then current market conditions (which determination may be made in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of BidCo (for which it can conclusively rely on the advice and feedback of its tax advisers)). _Restrictions on Enforcement by Midco Finance Party_ Until the Priority Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group: (i) no Midco Finance Party nor MidCo shall direct the Shared Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise (to the extent applicable) require the enforcement of, any Shared Collateral; and (ii) no Midco Finance Party nor Midco shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action against a member of the ICA Group in relation to the Midco Group Liabilities, except as permitted under the provisions set out under the caption “—Permitted Midco Enforcement” below, _provided, however, that no such action required by an Instructing Group need be taken except to the extent such_ Instructing Group otherwise is entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to direct such action.

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a Debtor and the Shared Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities or the Debtor liabilities owed by that Debtor or holding company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company: (A) (if the Shared Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend that any transferee of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement;

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Midco Creditors are entitled to give, and have given, instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Shared Security Agent is not authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor), following that release.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the holders of the Notes. Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the applicable Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles, to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance, capital maintenance rules and other laws or will be limited as set out in the respective Guarantee. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related _to the Notes and Our Structure—Each Guarantee and the security interests in the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—Local insolvency laws may not be as favorable to you as insolvency laws of jurisdictions with which you may be familiar and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes.” For example, the_ Guarantees by our Italian subsidiaries, Wittur Italia Holding s.r.l. and Wittur S.p.A., are expected to be limited to €5.0 million and €1.0 million, respectively (based on a Completion Date of March 31, 2015). The limitation of the Italian Guarantees will be calculated as a percentage of the intercompany proceeds loans used to refinance existing indebtedness of our Italian subsidiaries and could be higher or lower, depending on the amount of outstanding local debt on the actual Completion Date. In addition, the Guarantee provided by Wittur Asanso¨r San. V Tic. A.S., our subsidiary in Turkey, will be capped at €2.5 million. However, we cannot provide any assurances that holders of the Notes will be able to recover even these amounts under such Guarantees, as 176 ----- payment under each Guarantee is contractually subordinated to all the senior indebtedness of such Guarantor, including such Guarantor’s obligations under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations.

The Notes and each Notes Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any).

The Escrow Account will be pledged on a first-priority basis in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, pursuant to an escrow account charge dated the Issue Date between the Issuer and the Trustee (the “Escrow Charge”). The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to the Escrow Account (less any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement) are referred to, collectively, as the “Escrowed Property.” In order to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property to the Issuer (the “Release”), the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall have received from the Issuer, at a time that is on or before the Escrow Longstop Date, an Officer’s Certificate, upon which both the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall conclusively rely, without further investigation or liability, to the effect that: - the Acquisition will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Acquisition Agreement, promptly following release of the Escrowed Property, except for any changes or other modifications that will not, individually or when taken as whole, have a material adverse effect on the holders of the Notes; - immediately after consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will own, directly or indirectly, the entire share capital of the Target; and - as of the Completion Date, there is no Default or Event of Default under clause (6) of the first paragraph under the heading titled “Events of Default” below.

On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Principal Paying Agent for payment to each Holder the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Notes and, concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if any) to the Issuer. In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption exceeds the amount of the Escrowed Property, Bain Capital Europe Fund IV, L.P. will be required to make an equity contribution to the Issuer in an amount required to enable the Issuer to pay the accrued and unpaid interest, plus Additional Amounts, if any, owing to the Holders of the Notes, pursuant to an agreement 179 ----- between Bain Capital Europe Fund IV, L.P. and the Trustee.

Receipt by the Trustee of either an Officer’s Certificate for the release or a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption (provided funds sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price are in the Escrow Account) shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Charge.

If any such limit applies, the guarantees and security provided will be limited to the maximum amount, which the relevant member of the Group may provide having regard to applicable law (including any jurisprudence) and subject to fiduciary duties of management.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be the Irish Times) or to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the official website of the Irish Stock Exchange (www.ise.ie). Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. 190 ----- The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Senior Facilities Agreement and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the _Notes and Our Structure—We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control, and the occurrence of certain important corporate events may not constitute a change of control.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant: (1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one (or more, if applicable) of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant; (2) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Completion Date under the Senior Facilities shall be deemed initially Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) or (4)(c) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and may not be reclassified; (3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included; (4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), 194 ----- (11) or (13) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included; (5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof; (6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; (7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS; and (8) accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the euro equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Euro Equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of “Refinancing Indebtedness”; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness (i) outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date and (ii) of the Target and its Restricted Subsidiaries outstanding on the Completion Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Completion Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

However, a default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4) and (6) the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) above has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (i) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (ii) all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee customary indemnification and/or security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; 214 ----- (2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of such indemnity and/or security; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a responsible officer of the Trustee is aware, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to customary indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against all losses and expenses (including legal fees) caused by taking or not taking such action. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Issuer with the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015), an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

None of us, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the transfer agent and the Initial Purchasers is responsible for those operations or procedures. The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited.

Income derived from capital investments under the Notes as well as capital gains (which include currency gains and losses, if any) from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes held by an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany are in general subject to German income tax at a flat-tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the Notes are held as private investment (Privatvermögen). Individual holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married couples filing jointly), whereby actually incurred higher expenses directly attributable to a capital investment are not deductible. The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany on income from capital investments under the Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld (as described under section “—Withholding Tax” below). To the extent withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case of Notes kept in custody abroad or of no German Disbursing Agent (as defined below) being involved in the payment process, the individual holder must include his or her income and capital gains derived from the Notes in his or her annual tax return and will then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). Further, an individual holder may apply for a taxation of all investment income of a given year at his or her lower individual tax rate based upon an assessment to tax with any amounts over-withheld being refunded. In each case, the deduction of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not permitted. Losses incurred with respect to the Notes can only be offset with investment income of the individual holder realized in the same or following assessment periods. Pursuant to a tax decree issued by the German Federal Ministry of Finance dated October 9, 2012 a bad debt-loss (Forderungsausfall) and a waiver of a receivable (Forderungsverzicht), to the extent the waiver does not qualify as a hidden capital contribution, shall not be treated as a disposal. Accordingly, losses suffered upon such bad debt-loss or waiver shall not be tax-deductible if the Notes are held as private investment (Privatvermögen). The same rules should be applicable according to the said tax decree, if the Notes expire worthless so that losses may not be tax-deductible at all. Losses suffered in a sale of Notes will only be recognized according to the view of the tax authorities, if the proceeds received in the sale exceed the respective transaction costs. Where Notes form part of a trade or business of an individual or corporate holder or the income from the Notes qualifies as income from the letting and leasing of property, the withholding tax, if any, will not satisfy the personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual or corporate income tax (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax). Where Notes form part of a trade or business, interest (accrued) must be taken into account as income. The respective holder will have to include income and related (business) expenses in the annual tax return and the balance will be taxed at the holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability, will 256 ----- be refunded Where Notes form part of a German trade or business the current income and gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes may also be subject to German trade tax. The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz). If the holder is an individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely or partly credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method. _Non-Tax Residents_ Interest, including accrued interest, and capital gains (which include currency gains and losses, if any) from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes received by holders who are not tax-resident in Germany (i.e., holders whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat and place of effective management and control is not located in Germany) are generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of the business property of a permanent establishment, including a permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained in Germany by the holder or (ii) the income otherwise constitutes German source income. In cases (i) and (ii) a tax regime similar to that explained above under subsection “—Tax Residents” applies.

The European Commission and certain EU member states (including Germany) are currently intending to introduce a financial transaction tax (“FTT”—see also below “The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax (FTT)”) (presumably on secondary market transactions involving at least one financial intermediary). If the FTT is introduced, transfers of Notes in which a financial intermediary established or deemed to be established in a participating member state may be subject to FTT at a rate that will be determined separately by each participating member state. 258 -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

If the individual holder is subject to church tax, a church tax surcharge will also be withheld. For German Disbursing Agents an electronic information system for church withholding tax purposes applies in relation to investment income received after December 31, 2014, with the effect that church tax will be collected by the German Disbursing Agent by way of withholding unless the investor has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern) in which case the investor will be assessed to church tax. The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly and factually related to the disposal and the cost of acquisition taking into account currency gains and losses, if any) and interest accrued on the Notes (“Accrued Interest,” Stückzinsen) derived by an individual holder who is a German resident irrespective of any holding period provided the Notes have been held in a custodial account with the same German Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition. If interest coupons or interest claims are disposed of separately (i.e., without the Notes), the proceeds from the disposition are subject to withholding tax. The same applies to proceeds from the redemption of interest coupons or interest claims if the Notes have been disposed of separately. To the extent the Notes have not been kept in a custodial account with the same German Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition or if the Notes have been transferred into the custodial account of the German Disbursing Agent only after their acquisition, upon the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment withholding tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (plus Accrued Interest, if any), unless the current German Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the Notes by the previous German Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a bank or financial services institution within the European Union, European Economic Area or certain other countries in accordance with Art. 17 para. 2(i) of the EU Council Directive 2003/48/EC dated June 3, 2003 on the Taxation of Savings Income in the form of interest payments (the “EU Savings Tax Directive”) (for example, Switzerland or Andorra). If the withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes has been calculated on the basis of 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), a German tax resident individual holder may and in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds must also apply for an assessment on the basis of his or her actual acquisition costs. 257 ----- In computing any German withholding tax, the German Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis of the withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the Notes via the German Disbursing Agent (for example, losses from the sale of other securities with the exception of shares). The German Disbursing Agent may also deduct Accrued Interest on the Notes or other securities paid separately upon the acquisition of the respective security via the German Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain requirements and restrictions the German Disbursing Agent may credit foreign withholding taxes levied on investment income in a given year regarding securities held by the individual holder in the custodial account with the German Disbursing Agent. Foreign withholding taxes levied pursuant to the EU Savings Directive may only be credited in the course of the assessment. Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the German Disbursing Agent, the German Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married couples filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be withheld from the gross payment to be made by the German Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted if the holder of the Notes has submitted to the German Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungsbescheinigung) issued by the competent local tax office. German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of Notes held by a corporate holder who is a German tax resident (including via a commercial partnership, as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal forms the status of corporation has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax office) while ongoing payments, such as interest payments, are subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of foreign tax and losses incurred). The same may apply where the Notes form part of a trade or business (of an individual or of a commercial partnership) subject to further requirements being met. Interest and capital gains received by non-tax residents of Germany (i.e. persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management and control is not located in Germany) are, in general, not subject to German withholding tax and the solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital gain is subject to German taxation (as outlined above under “—Non-Tax Residents”) and the Notes are held in a custodial account with a German Disbursing Agent, withholding tax will be levied under certain circumstances. Where Notes are not kept in a custodial account with a German Disbursing Agent and interest or proceeds from the disposal, assignment or redemption of a Note or an interest coupon are paid over- the-counter by a German Disbursing Agent to a non-resident, withholding tax will also apply.

The competent authority of the EU member state of the paying agent (within the meaning of the EU Savings Tax Directive) is then required to communicate this information to the competent authority of the EU member state of which the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident. However, for a transitional period, Austria is instead required (unless during that period they elect otherwise) to withhold tax from such payments currently at a rate of 35% (the ending of such transitional period being dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to information exchange with certain other countries). A number of non-EU countries including Switzerland, and certain dependent or associated territories of certain EU member states, have adopted similar measures (either provision of information or transitional withholding) in relation to payments made by a person within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident or certain limited types of entity established in a EU member state (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland at a rate of 35% with the option of the individual to have the paying agent and Switzerland provide to the tax authorities of the EU member state the details of the interest payments in lieu of the withholding). In addition, the EU member states have entered into provision of information or transitional withholding arrangements with certain of those dependent or associated territories in relation to payments made by a person in a EU member state to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident or certain limited types of entity established in one of those territories of non-EU countries and territories. By legislative regulations dated January 26, 2004, the German Federal Government enacted provisions implementing the information exchange on the basis of the EU Savings Tax Directive into German law. On March 24, 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive amending and broadening the scope of the requirements described above. Member States are required to apply these new requirements starting January 1, 2017. The changes will expand the range of payments covered by the Directive, in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities. The Directive will also expand the circumstances in which payments that indirectly benefit an individual resident in a Member State must be reported.

If any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.

A U.S. holder of a Note that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a payment of stated interest will be required to include in ordinary income the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment (translated at the “spot rate” on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars. A cash method U.S. holder will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but may have exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros so received. A U.S. holder of a Note that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the amount of interest income in euros that has accrued with respect to a Note during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such accrued income will be determined by translating such income at the average rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within each taxable year. A U.S. holder of a Note may elect, however, to translate such accrued interest income using the rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, using the rate of exchange on the last day of the taxable year. If the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. holder may translate such interest at the “spot rate” on the date of receipt. The above election will apply to other obligations held by the U.S. holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder of a Note that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income on the date such interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received (translated at the “spot rate” on the date such payment is received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of interest income that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars. Such gain or loss will generally constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated as U.S. source income or as an offset to U.S. source income, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws and state, local, foreign or other tax laws.",21.50.3,Original Issue Discount,"The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Notes will be treated as issued with OID and subject to special U.S. federal income tax rules if the excess of such Notes’ stated redemption price at maturity over their issue price is at least a de minimis amount (0.25% of such Notes’ stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years to their maturity). Generally, the “issue price” of the Notes will be the first price at which a substantial amount of such Notes are first sold to persons other than bondhouses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers. The “stated redemption price at maturity” of the Notes is the total of all payments provided by such Notes that are not payments of “qualified stated interest.” A “qualified stated interest” payment is generally any one of a series of stated interest payments on the Notes that is unconditionally payable at least annually at a single fixed rate or a qualified floating rate. U.S. holders of Notes issued with OID must include OID in income (as ordinary income) calculated on a constant-yield method before the receipt of cash attributable to the income, and will generally have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID over the life of the Notes. The amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. holder is the sum of the daily portions of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion of the taxable year in which the U.S. holder holds the Note. The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. Accrual periods with respect to a Note may be of any length selected by the U.S. holder and may vary in length over the term of the Note as long as (i) no accrual period is longer than one year and (ii) each scheduled payment of interest or principal on the Note occurs on either the final or first day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to an accrual period equals the excess of (a) the product of the Note’s adjusted issue price at the beginning of the accrual period and the Note’s yield to maturity (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period) over (b) the sum of the payments of qualified stated interest on the Note allocable to the accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the beginning of any accrual period is the issue price of the Note increased by (x) the amount of accrued 261 ----- OID for each prior accrual period and decreased by (y) the amount of any payments previously made on the Note that were not qualified stated interest payments. Any OID will be determined for any accrual period in euros and then translated into U.S. dollars in the same manner as stated interest accrued by an accrual basis U.S. holder, as described above. In such event, upon receipt of an amount attributable to OID (whether in connection with a payment of interest or the sale or disposition of such Note), a U.S. holder of such Note will recognize foreign currency gain or loss that will be treated as ordinary income or loss and be treated as U.S. source income or as an offset to U.S. source income, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations. The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a U.S. holder’s particular circumstances.

If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency translated at the “spot rate” on the date of disposition. In the case of a Note that is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized by translating such amount at the “spot rate” on the settlement date of the disposition. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally equal the cost of such Note to such U.S. holder increased by the amount of OID previously included in the U.S. holder’s income with respect to the Note, if any, less any payments made with respect to the Note that are not qualified stated interest payments. If a U.S. holder uses foreign currency to purchase a Note, the cost of the Note will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the date of purchase. In the case of a Note that is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder, and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note by translating the amount paid at the “spot rate” of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. The conversion of U.S. dollars to a foreign currency and the immediate use of that currency to purchase a Note generally will not result in taxable gain or loss for a U.S. holder. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. holders in regard to the purchase and sale of Notes traded on an established securities market, which is discussed in the two preceding paragraphs, must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Subject to the discussion of exchange gain or loss below, gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be U.S. source gain or loss and generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition the Note has been held by such U.S. holder for more than one year. Long-term capital gain realized by a non-corporate U.S. holder will generally be subject to taxation at a reduced rate. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitation. Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors as to the foreign tax credit implications of the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes. Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may recognize gain or loss that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note. For these purposes, the principal amount of a Note is the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in euros. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will equal the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the 262 ----- Note, determined on the date such payment is received for the Note or such Note is disposed of, and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note, determined on the date the U.S. holder acquired such Note. Such gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be treated as U.S. source income or as an offset to U.S. source income, respectively. In addition, exchange gain or loss may be realized with respect to accrued interest and accrued OID, if any, as discussed under “—Payments of Stated Interest” and “—Original Issue Discount.” However, upon a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder will realize exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and accrued interest and accrued OID, if any, only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized on the disposition.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

In addition, a U.S. holder that is not an exempt recipient may be subject to backup withholding (at a 28% rate) unless it provides a taxpayer identification number and otherwise complies with applicable certification requirements. Backup withholding is not an additional tax.

Therefore, a judgment rendered by any court in the United States (whether a Federal court or a State court) against an Austrian Guarantor or against an Austrian collateral provider whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws will not be enforceable in Austria.

Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, proceedings must first be initiated in England by way of a civil law action on the judgment debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. To enforce the judgment debt, the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles or rules of English private international law; - the U.S. judgment was final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounces it and being for a debt for a definitive sum of money; - the U.S. judgment was not for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a penalty or fine or otherwise based on a non-English law that an English court considers to relate to penal, revenue or other public law; - the U.S. judgment does not contravene public policy or statute in England and Wales; - the U.S. judgment has not been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and is not otherwise in breach of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980; - the U.S. judgment has not been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural or substantial justice; 272 ----- - the U.S. judgment is not a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English court or another court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England or conflicts with an earlier judgment of such court; - the English enforcement proceedings were commenced within the relevant limitation period; and - the U.S. judgment was not obtained contrary to an agreement for the settlement of disputes under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in a United States court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit). Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Notwithstanding this, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England. In addition, we cannot assure you whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England, instead of the United States and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. These methods generally permit the court discretion to prescribe the manner of enforcement. It may not be possible to obtain an English judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set off or counterclaim against the judgment creditor.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442
433,Offerings 2015.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.3,Germany,23.3.1,,"The Issuer and certain Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Germany. Our directors and executive officers live outside the United States. The assets of our directors and executive officers and almost all our assets are located outside the United States. As a result, although we have appointed an agent for service of process under the Indenture, it may be difficult for you to serve process on those persons or us in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them or us based on civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States. We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on the state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts. The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. Under current practice, a final and conclusive judgment by a U.S. court, however, may be recognized and thereby given binding effect in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of the U.S. judgment by a German court is conditional upon a number of factors, including the following requirements which are set out in Section 328 of the German Code of Civil Procedure: - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction of the case in accordance with German law principles of jurisdictional competence; - the document introducing the proceedings was duly served and made known to the defendant in a timely manner that allowed for adequate defense; - the judgment is not contrary to (i) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a German court or (ii) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which is to be recognized in Germany and the procedure leading to the respective judgment under (i) or (ii) is not in contradiction to any such prior judgment or a proceeding previously commenced in Germany; - the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with material principles of German law, including, without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of Germany (Grundrechte). In this context, it should be noted that any component of a U.S. federal or state court civil judgment awarding punitive damages or any other damages which do not serve a compensatory purpose, such as treble damages, will not be enforced in Germany. They are regarded to be in conflict with material principles of German law; 273 ----- - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed; and - the judgment became res judicata in accordance with the law of the place where it was pronounced. Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after having received an exequatur decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above principles. Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. courts in Germany. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. German courts usually deny the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages (which do not serve a compensatory purpose) as they are regarded to be in conflict with fundamental principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium, general principles of good faith (Treu und Glauben), clawback (Anfechtung) as well as other similar laws affecting creditor’s rights generally. In addition, it is doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In as far as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior to trial compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No equivalent pre-trial discovery process exists under German law. If the party in whose favor a final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States against such party or such persons will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Furthermore, although the Italian Guarantors will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any action in relation to the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on the Italian Guarantors or on such other persons as mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws. If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Italian Guarantors, or any of its respective directors or executive officers, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company or individual has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for the Republic of Italy you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States. We have been advised by counsel in the Republic of Italy that the recognition and enforcement of a judgment rendered by a U.S. federal or New York state court in the Republic of Italy is governed by Article 64 of 274 ----- the Private International Law Act (i.e., Law 218 of May 31, 1995) (the “PIL Act”) (and certain other provisions of the PIL Act). Pursuant to the PIL Act, any judgment issued by a U.S. federal or New York state court should automatically be recognized in the Republic of Italy provided that the following requirements are met: - the relevant U.S. federal or New York state court that passed the judgment had jurisdiction under the principles on jurisdiction of Italian law; - the defendant had received the summons in accordance with the laws of the state where the proceedings have taken place, and the defendant had not been deprived of his fundamental rights of defense; - the parties had appeared in the proceedings in accordance with the local procedural law, or the default proceedings (in contumacia) were declared in accordance with that law; - the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court must be final and binding (passato _in giudicato) according to the law of the state in which it was rendered;_ - the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is not in conflict with any earlier final and binding judgment issued by an Italian court; - there is no pending proceeding before any Italian court in relation to the same subject matter and between the same parties which started prior to the commencement of the proceedings before the relevant U.S. federal or New York state court; and - the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is not contrary to Italian public policy. In addition, according to Article 67 of the PIL Act, if a judgment rendered by a U.S. federal or New York state court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or it is necessary to enforce such judgment, a proceeding must be instituted in the competent Court of Appeal in the Republic of Italy to that end. The competent Court of Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but reviews exclusively the existence of all the requirements set out above (including requiring that the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New York state court is not contrary to public policy in Italy).",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

The terms “enforceable”, “enforceability”, “valid”, “legal”, “binding” and “effective” (or any combination thereof) mean that all the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type that may be enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. In particular, enforcement before the courts will in any event be subject to: - the nature of the remedies available in the courts; and - the availability of defenses such as (without limitation), set-off (unless validly waived), fraud (fraude _de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure,_ unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, abatement and counter-claim. In general terms, under Spanish law, any guarantee must guarantee another obligation to which it is ancillary, which must be clearly identified in the relevant guarantee agreement. Therefore, the guarantee, due to its incidental nature (principio de accesoriedad) follows the underlying obligation in such a way that nullity or termination of the underlying obligation entails nullity of the guarantee and termination of the underlying obligation entails termination of the guarantee. In the event that the guarantors are able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed principal obligations (obligación principal garantizada), Spanish courts may consider that the guarantors’ obligations under the relevant guarantees are not enforceable. Under Spanish law, there are some provisions on equity capitalization which have been taken into account when guarantees are enforced. For example, when payments under a guarantee cause the net equity (patrimonio _neto) of Wittur Elevator Components, S.A.U. (the “Spanish Guarantor”) to fall below half of its share capital,_ the Spanish Guarantor will be obliged to be wound up (disolución), unless its share capital is increased or decreased in the required amount to re-establish the balance between its net equity and its share capital (capital _social), and provided it is not required to file for insolvency._ 275 ----- Under Spanish law, guarantees of the type issued by the Spanish Guarantor to guarantee the Notes (the “Spanish Guarantee”) may only be granted by those entities that are incorporated as stock companies under the laws of Spain (sociedades anónimas or “S.A.”). This is due to the fact that any subsidiary incorporated as limited liability companies under the laws of Spain (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada or “S.L.”) is subject to the prohibition contained in article 402 of the Spanish Royal Decree Law 1/2010, of 2 July, on Spanish companies (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2010, de 2 de julio, por el que se aprueba el Texto Refundido de la Ley de _Sociedades de Capital (the “Spanish Companies Act”)), which states that a limited liability company cannot_ execute or secure a bond issuance or other issuance of securities. The Spanish Companies Act prohibits financial assistance to stock companies (sociedades anónimas or S.A.) in relation to the acquisition of their own shares or the shares of their direct or indirect holding company. Therefore, the obligations under the Spanish Guarantee granted by a Spanish Guarantor: - shall not extend to any use of the proceeds of the Notes for the purpose of acquiring shares representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of its direct or indirect holding company, as it is the case of the Acquisition, or refinancing a previous debt incurred for the acquisition of shares representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of its direct or indirect holding company, as it is the case of part of the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement; and - shall be deemed not to be undertaken or incurred by the Spanish Guarantor to the extent that the same would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of article 150 of Spanish Companies Act, and, in that case, all provisions of such Spanish Guarantee shall be construed accordingly in the sense that, in no case can any Spanish Guarantee given by the Spanish Guarantor secure repayment of the above mentioned funds. Therefore, the obligations and liabilities assumed by the Spanish Guarantor under the Spanish Guarantee shall be deemed to have been given only in relation to the use of proceeds of the Notes which are not used neither for (i) the funding of the Acquisition, (ii) the refinancing of the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, to the extent that such funds were used for a previous acquisition of shares of the Spanish Guarantor or its direct or indirect holding company, nor (iii) the payment of the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the above transactions. For the purposes of first paragraph above, a reference to a “holding company” of the Spanish Guarantor shall mean the company (if any) which, directly or indirectly, owns the majority of the voting rights of such Spanish Guarantor or that may have a dominant influence on such Spanish Guarantor. It shall be presumed that one company has a dominant influence on another company when: - any of the scenarios set out in section 1 of article 42 of the Spanish Commercial Code (Código de _Comercio) are met; or_ - when at least half plus one of the members of the managing body of the Spanish Guarantor are also members of the managing body or top managers (altos directivos) of the dominant company or of another company controlled by such dominant company. The holders of the Notes from time to time will not be the secured parties under the security interest, governed by Spanish law, which will be granted to secure the obligations and liabilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement. Under Spanish law, a security interest created as security for the benefit of third parties who are not direct parties to the relevant agreement creating the security interest are unenforceable by such parties. Notwithstanding, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a parallel debt structure (as an abstract obligation independent from the obligation under the Notes) whereby, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, all the Debtors (as defined therein), including the Issuer, undertake to pay to the Security Agent any amount payable by them under the Notes. This allows the Security Agent to be the beneficiary of such security interest governed by Spanish law. Upon enforcement of the security interest governed by Spanish law, the price obtained from the auction shall be delivered by the notary public directly to the Security Agent for its distribution amongst the creditors in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. The use of parallel debt in Spanish deals is a new concept, and there has not been any court precedent to ensure its validity and enforceability. Also, the registration of the security interests governed by Spanish law may be rejected if the relevant registrar considers that this structure is not valid or enforceable. 276 -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

This means that a judgment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability would not be directly enforceable in Sweden. In order to enforce any such judgment in Sweden, proceedings must therefore be initiated by way of civil law action on the judgment debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in Sweden, or an administrative tribunal or executive or other public authority of the Kingdom of Sweden.

To be recognized and enforced in these enforcement proceedings, the foreign judgment must meet all of the following requirements: - there must be a relevant de jure or de facto reciprocity of recognition of judgments between the courts of Turkey on the one hand, and the foreign jurisdiction where the judgment has been obtained on the other. The legal basis for such reciprocity can be evidenced by (i) a treaty between Turkey and the foreign jurisdiction providing for the reciprocal enforcement of court judgments, (ii) a provision in the laws of the foreign jurisdiction permitting the enforcement in that jurisdiction of the judgments rendered by Turkish courts or (iii) de facto enforcement in the foreign jurisdiction of the judgments rendered by Turkish courts; - the foreign judgment must be final and binding, with no recourse to appeal (or similar review processes) in the jurisdiction where the judgment has been obtained; - the subject matter of the dispute must not fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Turkey; - the foreign judgment must not be incompatible with a Turkish judgment between the same parties and pertaining to the same issues. Moreover, and in certain circumstances, the foreign judgment must not be incompatible with an earlier judgment obtained in the same foreign jurisdiction regarding the relevant matter at hand and enforceable in Turkey (i.e. an earlier foreign judgment that satisfies the enforceability criteria discussed here); - the judgment must not have been rendered by a foreign court that has deemed itself competent even though it has no actual relationship with the parties or the subject matter at hand; - the judgment must be of a civil nature; - the foreign judgment must not violate any Turkish public policy rules; and - due process must have been followed in the jurisdiction where the foreign judgment has been obtained, whereby the party against whom the enforcement of the judgment is sought, must have been “duly served” or must have been made fully aware of the proceedings and given the full opportunity to represent/defend itself in the trial or he/she should not object the enforcement request before Turkish courts. There is currently no treaty between the United States and Turkey providing for the reciprocal enforcement of judgments. There is no published precedent confirming de facto reciprocity between United States and Turkey. There is uncertainty as to enforceability of US court judgements in Turkey in the future since de facto reciprocity is decided by the relevant court on a case-by-case basis and may vary based on each independent state. Moreover, in practice, it would be difficult to execute a foreign court decision in Turkey, if the foreign court decision does not include a clear monetary order.

The determination of where such company has its centre of main interests is generally a question of fact on which the courts of different EU Member States, despite decisions of the ECJ on such matters, may have differing and even conflicting views. The term “centre of main interests” is not a static, but rather a fact and circumstances-based concept and may therefore change from time to time. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a company has its centre of main interests in the Member State in which it has its registered office, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the centre of main interests of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which “is therefore ascertainable by third parties.” In that respect, factors such as the location at which board meetings are held and the location where the company conducts the majority of its business, including the perception of the company’s creditors of the center of the company’s business operations, may all be relevant in determining where the company has its centre of main interests, with the company’s centre of main interests at the time of initiation of the relevant insolvency proceedings being not only decisive for the international jurisdiction of the courts of a certain Member State, but also for the insolvency laws applicable to these insolvency proceedings because each court would, subject to certain exemptions, apply its local insolvency laws (lex fori concursus). If the centre of main interests of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member State. If the centre of main interests of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open secondary (or “territorial”) insolvency proceedings only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State within the meaning of Article 2(h) 279 ----- of the EU Insolvency Regulation. An “establishment” is defined as a place of operations where the company carries on non-transitory economic activity with human means and goods. The effects of those secondary insolvency proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor located in the territory of such other Member State. If the main insolvency proceedings have been opened by the court of the EU Member State where the centre of main interests of the debtor is situated, and are outstanding, then the secondary proceedings can only be one of the winding-up proceedings listed in Annex B to the EU Insolvency Regulation. If the company does not have an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open secondary insolvency proceedings in respect of such issuer or guarantor under the EU Insolvency Regulation. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the company has its centre of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can be opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment only if either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s centre of main interests is situated as a result of conditions laid down by that Member State’s law; or (b) the secondary insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor that is domiciled, habitually resident or has its registered office in the Member State in which the company has an establishment or whose claim arises from the operation of that establishment. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court which has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. In the event that the Issuer or any provider of collateral experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer and the collateral provided by the Issuer or any other company. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another. The EU Insolvency Regulation does not contain specific rules dealing with the insolvency of a multinational group of companies which generally means that separate proceedings must be opened for each individual member of the group and that these proceedings may be entirely independent of each other and governed by different jurisdictions. The lack of specific provisions for group insolvency may diminish the prospects of successful restructuring of the group of companies as a whole and may lead to a break-up of the group in its constituting parts. The European Commission has released a draft proposal for a regulation amending the EU Insolvency Regulation providing, inter alia, for a coordination of the insolvency proceedings concerning different members of the same group.

In such case, certain transactions are either subject to the restructuring administrator’s approval or may be performed only by the restructuring administrator. While bankruptcy proceedings aim at the debtor’s liquidation (the sale of the whole insolvency estate and distribution of sales proceeds), restructuring proceedings aim at the preservation of the debtor as a going concern. To that end, a restructuring plan (Sanierungsplan) must be prepared by the debtor and presented to its unsecured creditors for approval. Such restructuring plan presented in the course of restructuring proceedings with selfadministration must offer satisfaction of all preferred claims and at least 30% of the insolvency claims payable within two years. In case of a restructuring plan to be adopted in the course of restructuring proceedings without self-administration, the minimum quota is lowered to 20%. If the adopted restructuring plan is fulfilled, the debtor is discharged of all its past debts. A debtor is deemed insolvent if one or both of the following applies: (i) if it is illiquid, i.e. it is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due and payable, provided that such payment delay is not only temporary where there is a high probability that liquid funds will be available in the near future (the cash flow test). Courts allow the debtor a grace period, which (depending on the court) may take up to three months to overcome its payment delays before they consider the debtor illiquid; and/or (ii) if the debtor is over-indebted, i.e. : liabilities on the debtor’s balance sheet exceed the assets, in the presence of a negative going concern forecast (negative _Fortbestandsprognose) (the balance sheet test). Insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzverfahren) must be opened by_ a court in the event that the debtor is insolvent. The effective date of insolvency is the date on which the debtor is, as a matter of fact, insolvent. The effective date is crucial with respect to a number of issues, including managing directors’ obligation to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the beginning of hardening periods. The debtor is obliged, “without culpable delay,” to apply for the opening of insolvency proceedings no later than 60 days after the insolvency effective date. During this 60-day period, the managing directors may make reasonable efforts to prepare for a filing of restructuring proceedings or agree with the creditors on an out-of court settlement. Typically, the insolvency proceedings are opened immediately upon application by the debtor. Further, in the case that a debtor is at imminent risk of being unable to pay its debts when they fall due (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit), the debtor may (but is not obliged to) apply for the opening of restructuring proceedings._ A creditor may also file for the opening of insolvency proceedings but will have to demonstrate that the debtor is insolvent or over-indebted. In the case of an imminent risk of insolvency, a creditor may, however, not initiate the opening of insolvency proceedings. The initiation of insolvency proceedings brings about substantive and procedural law effects as of the beginning of the day (0:00 a.m.) that follows the publication of the court’s order to open such proceedings in the 281 ----- official online insolvency data base (www.edikte.justiz.gv.at). As of this point in time, the managing directors lose the power to dispose over the insolvency estate—except in respect to legal acts in the course of ordinary business undertaken in restructuring proceedings with self-administration—and legal acts by the managing directors performed thereafter are ineffective as far as the creditors are concerned. In particular, the following are the most important effects: Contracts may be terminated. As a general rule, bilateral agreements are not automatically terminated in case of the opening of insolvency proceedings. However, in a case where a bilateral agreement has not been fully fulfilled by both the debtor and the other party to such agreement, the insolvency administrator has the choice whether to continue and fulfil such agreement or to prematurely terminate such agreement within a certain time period to be set by the court upon application of one of the parties. Further, any appointment as a legal representative (Vollmachtsnehmer) or as an agent (Auftragnehmer) granted by a debtor will cease to be valid upon the opening of insolvency proceedings over its assets. Additionally, the insolvency administrator has certain preferential rights to terminate employment contracts in case the debtor’s enterprise or a part thereof is closed or downsized during insolvency proceedings. A debtor’s contractual partner must not terminate contracts concluded with the debtor for a period of six months if such termination could endanger the continuation of the debtor’s business. Pursuant to section 25b para 2 of the Austrian Insolvency Act, a contractual stipulation providing for the right to withdraw from the agreement or for an automatic termination in the event of opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzverfahren) against the other party is not enforceable by the debtor’s contractual partner. Any individual enforcement action brought against the debtor’s assets by any of its unsecured creditors is subject to an automatic stay upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. The title owner (Eigentümer) or the economic owner (in case of a trust relationship (Treuhandschaft)) of an asset in the possession of the debtor at the time of the opening of insolvency proceedings has a right of separation (Aussonderungsrecht) with regard to its assets. Such separation assets (Aussonderungsgut) do not form part of the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) and the relevant creditor can (subject to a six-month stay as described below) require the surrender of its separation assets. During a period of six months after the opening of insolvency proceedings, the owners’ claims for surrender of its separation asset are stayed (that is a legal respite becomes effective) if such surrender would endanger the continuation of the business conduct of the debtor provided that, among other things, such stay does not cause a severe personal or economic harm to the owner. Creditor’s rights secured by a right in rem over the debtor’s assets or any part thereof (for example, by a mortgage or pledge over bank accounts, receivables, movables) are not affected by the opening of insolvency proceedings. This, however, requires prior perfection of the establishment of the security interest (subject to a six-month stay as described below). Such secured creditors have a right of preferential satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) with regard to charged assets (Absonderungsgut) and are as such entitled to satisfy their claims out of the enforcement proceeds with regard to such charged assets. To the extent the net enforcement proceeds exceed the amount of secured claims, the excess proceeds are distributed to the unsecured creditors on a _pro rata basis._ As is the case with the right to separation, the right of preferential satisfaction of a secured creditor may be subject to a compulsory stay for a period of six months. Secured creditors who are not only secured by a charged asset, but also have a direct claim for payment against the debtor may participate with their claims which are not covered by the charged asset in the pro rata distribution of the insolvency estate in a bankruptcy proceedings or in the restructuring plan. The rights of a secured creditor depend on the type of its right of preferential satisfaction. If no compulsory stay applies or once the six month period has expired, the secured creditor can assert its claim outside of insolvency proceedings in regular court. The proceeds from the realization serve the preferred satisfaction of the secured claims. A creditor is entitled to exercise its rights of set-off and netting in the course of insolvency proceedings; however, leaving aside certain derivatives and other financial/treasury transactions, such rights are restricted to 282 ----- claims that have been compensable at the time of the opening of insolvency proceedings. A creditor’s claim that has not become due at the time of the opening of insolvency proceedings, as well as a creditor’s claim that is subject to a condition, are compensable by operation of law. As a general rule, the debtor’s enterprise (as well as its assets) must not be sold in the course of restructuring proceedings since restructuring proceedings aim at the preservation of the debtor as a going concern. In contrast, bankruptcy proceedings aim at the liquidation of the debtor through the sale of its assets. A bankruptcy administrator is only appointed upon the opening of bankruptcy proceedings and restructuring proceedings without self-administration whereby the managing directors lose control over the debtor. In case of restructuring proceedings with self-administration the managing directors stay in control of the debtor; however, a restructuring administrator having a right to veto certain transactions out of the ordinary business is appointed. Under the supervision of the insolvency court and the creditors’ committee, the insolvency administrator is acting in the interest of all creditors and its main functions are evaluating the merits of insolvency claims filed by creditors; deciding on whether the debtor’s business may be continued; examining whether a restructuring plan is in the common interest of all creditors; distribution of liquidation proceeds; and, in case of a bankruptcy administrator, the management of the debtor’s business (for certain transactions not part of the ordinary business, the consent of the creditors’ committee or insolvency court is required). As a general rule, the insolvency estate consists of all of the debtor’s assets with a monetary value at the time of the opening of insolvency proceedings and all assets which have been acquired during such proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

If the counterpart had actual knowledge of such intention to cause disadvantage, such hardening period is extended to ten years.

Such indirect detriment to other creditors is in particular foreseeable in the presence of an unfit restructuring concept (offensichtlich untaugliches Restrukturierungskonzept), such legal acts of the debtor can be contested provided that such legal acts (Rechtshandlungen) were undertaken within a hardening period of six months. Outside of insolvency proceedings, creditors can use the rights of contestation granted to them by the Austrian Act on Avoidance of Legal Transactions (Anfechtungsordnung). However, this act limits the right of contestation to transactions similar to those mentioned above of the Austrian Insolvency Act. The claim for contestation can be filed by any creditor whose claim against the debtor has not been satisfied by the proceedings under the Austrian Enforcement Act (Exekutionsordnung) or is not likely to be satisfied by such proceedings. The relevant point in time is not the formal opening of insolvency proceedings, but the filing of the contestation claim with the competent court.

Consequently, the granting of guarantees as well as the assumption of certain obligations of other group companies by them is subject to certain mandatory Austrian capital maintenance rules (“Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules”), including, without limitation, section 82 et seq. of the Austrian Act on Limited Liability (Gesetz über _Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung)._ Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules aim at preserving the capital of, among others, a company with limited liability against unlawful distributions by such company to its shareholders. According to Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules any direct or indirect distribution (a “Distribution”)—i.e., the entering into a business transaction that provides for any value transfer, including, but without limitation, providing a guarantee or any other security interest—to a shareholder, including to a third party upon request of a shareholder (e.g., to a holding company (up-stream) or a sister company (side-stream)), without adequate consideration constitutes an unlawful repayment of capital contributions (verbotene Einlagenrückgewähr) and, consequently, violates Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules. Guarantees granted by an Austrian subsidiary in order to guarantee liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered Distributions and may thus be held (in whole or in part) invalid and unenforceable by Austrian courts if the granting of such guarantees were not at arm’s length terms or for the Austrian subsidiary’s corporate benefit (see below). A Distribution that does not provide for adequate consideration at first sight may, under certain circumstances, not constitute a violation of the Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules if it is “commercially justified (betrieblich gerechtfertigt).” Generally, a Distribution is deemed commercially justified (betrieblich _gerechtfertigt) if a prudent business man (sorgfältig handelnder Geschäftsleiter) would have entered with an_ unrelated third party under the same circumstances into this particular transaction and at the same terms (so called third party—or arm’s-length—test (Drittvergleich)). This needs, however, to be evaluated on a case by case basis taking into account all particularities of the respective transaction and based on the assessment of the overall benefit for the Austrian company; such corporate benefit may be e.g. the receipt of monetary compensation or other benefits received by the Austrian company which may result from the overall transaction. Any transaction violating Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules may be held (in whole or in part) null and void by Austrian courts. Consequently, any direct or indirect shareholder (side-stream or up-stream) who has 285 ----- received any Distribution under such transaction may be liable to its Austrian (direct or indirect) subsidiary for repayment of unlawfully received Distributions. The nullity may also affect a third party (e.g., noteholders) if such third party knew or should have known (gross negligence) that the respective transaction was not permitted pursuant to Austrian capital maintenance rules. Consequently, to the extent a guarantee is provided by an Austrian subsidiary to guarantee liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company or any liability or obligation is assumed by an Austrian subsidiary for the benefit of such parent or sister company, it is standard market practice to include limitation language in the relevant transaction documents (e.g. indentures, purchase agreements, guarantees etc.). Pursuant to such limitation language the scope of the guarantee / assumption of liability, as far as the Austrian subsidiary is concerned is limited to the extent permissible under Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules. No case law is available to confirm and it is thus not certain whether these limitations would be valid and enforceable under Austrian law and achieve the desired effect of legally preserving the guarantees to the extent possible or whether the guarantees could be deemed void in their entirety. Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules are subject to ongoing court decisions and it cannot be ruled out that future court decisions may further limit the access of creditors and/or shareholders to assets of Austrian subsidiaries, including, but without limitation, guarantees of Guarantors organized under Austrian laws, which could negatively affect our ability to make payment on the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Dutiable transactions include, e.g., lease agreements, sureties, assignments, mortgages. 286 ----- According to the Austrian Stamp Duty Act, stamp duty on, e.g.: (a) sureties (Bürgschaft) amounts to 1% of the guaranteed amount (a guarantee may be treated as a surety for stamp duty purposes if the guarantor under the guarantee does not explicitly waive all claims, remedies or defences with respect to the underlying guaranteed transaction); and (b) assignments amounts to 0.8% of the consideration for the assignment, or, in case of an assignment for security (Sicherungszession), 0.8% of the higher of the secured amount and the value of the assigned receivables. Assignments as security transaction (Sicherungszession) may—if certain prerequisites are met—benefit from an exemption pursuant to the Austrian Stamp Duty Act. Basically, Austrian stamp duty is triggered if a document on a dutiable transaction is created in Austria. Under certain circumstances, the creation of a document on a dutiable transaction outside of Austria may trigger stamp duty. In this case, stamp duty may generally be triggered if (i) the parties to the transaction are resident for stamp duty purposes in Austria (Austrian residence, place of habitual abode, seat, place of effective management or permanent establishment) and (ii) the transaction concerns an Austrian situated asset or a party to the transaction is entitled or obliged to performance under the transaction in Austria. If the creation of a document outside of Austria did not trigger Austrian stamp duty, stamp duty may be triggered if the document (or a certified copy thereof) is imported into Austria and (i) the transaction concerns an Austrian situated asset or a party to the transaction is entitled or obliged to performance under the transaction in Austria, or (ii) a legally relevant action is taken in Austria based on the transaction or official use of the document (or a certified copy thereof) is made in Austria. Austrian stamp duty may also be triggered by a document that refers to a dutiable transaction in a qualified manner (so called confirming document; rechtsbezeugende Urkunde). According to the Austrian Federal Ministry of Finance, a confirming document within the present context is constituted if the parties to and the nature of the transaction referred to may be derived from the document. Such document may (already) trigger Austrian stamp duty if signed by one of the parties and sent to the other party or its representative (or, in case of a transaction under which both parties are obliged to performance, a third party in order to furnish proof of the underlying transaction). Further, stamp duty may be triggered by a so called substitute document (Ersatzurkunde; e.g., a signed protocol on an orally agreed transaction) on a dutiable transaction or a document that incorporates by reference a document on a dutiable transaction. If Austrian stamp duty is triggered, pursuant to the Stamp Duty Act generally the parties to the transaction are jointly and severally liable for the amount of Austrian stamp duty triggered. In case of a transaction under which only one party is obliged to performance, the party in whose interest the document was created is liable for the stamp duty (e.g., the beneficiary in case of a surety). In any case, the other party (as well as, if the competent tax office is not duly notified of the dutiable transaction, the persons who would be responsible for such notification) would be secondarily liable for the stamp duty triggered. Agreements between the parties as to who shall bear stamp duty if triggered are not binding on the tax authorities but may be honored by the tax authorities within their discretion. If stamp duty was triggered and not duly paid or the competent tax office was not duly notified of a dutiable transaction, the competent tax office may, within its discretion, increase the amount of stamp duty due by up to 100 per cent, depending on whether the taxpayer could have recognized that stamp duty was triggered, the notification was made with slight or substantial delay, or provisions of the Stamp Duty Act have been infringed for the first time or repeatedly.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Main proceedings are insolvency proceedings commenced in the member state in which the debtor has its COMI and have effect throughout the EU. English insolvency law may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are more familiar. In the event that the UK guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including by the company, its directors or a creditor making an application for administration to the court, the company, its directors or a holder of a “qualifying floating charge” appointing an administrator out of court by filing a notice in court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company resolving to do so (in the case of liquidation). One of the grounds on which a company may be wound up is if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into administration if it is, or is likely, to become unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes. Under the Insolvency Act 1986, as amended (the “Insolvency Act”), a company is deemed to be unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due), if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), if it fails to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within the specified time or if it fails to satisfy in full a judgment debt (or similar court order). The UK guarantor’s obligations under the Notes are secured by security interests over the Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a Guarantee against the UK guarantor and the enforceability of security interests over the Collateral. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the UK guarantee and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the UK guarantee and/or the security documents and/or the Collateral securing the Notes (as the case may be) and the UK guarantee and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of the UK guarantor.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Under English insolvency law, there is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests expressed to be created by a security document could take effect as floating charges because the description 288 ----- given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed rather than floating security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the ability of the relevant chargor to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

An administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. The purpose of an administration is comprised of three parts that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to secured or preferential creditors. During the administration, in general, no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or continued against the company, or security enforced over the company’s property, except with leave of the court or the consent of the administrator. Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral agreement” (generally, cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended). If an English company were to enter administration, it is possible that, to the extent that it is not a financial collateral arrangement, the security granted by it or the guarantee granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration. In addition, other than in limited circumstances, a secured creditor will not be entitled to appoint an administrative receiver and any already appointed must vacate office on the making of an administration order against the company in administration. If the company is already in administration no other receiver may be appointed. In order to empower the Shared Security Agent to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company out of court, the floating charge granted by the relevant English obligor must constitute a “qualifying floating charge” for purposes of English insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the Insolvency Act as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002 to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. The Security Agent will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant English company and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant company under the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, and is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying charge using the out of court procedure) in certain circumstances. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator. An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver in certain circumstances) or liquidator of the company will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors after making full provision for preferential creditors and 289 ----- expenses (floating charge realizations). Under current law, this applies to 50 per cent of the first £10,000 of net property (the amount of a company’s property which would otherwise have been available for satisfaction of claims of a holder of a debenture secured by or holders of floating charges created by the company) and 20 per cent of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £600,000.

The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years from the date the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction might be subject to being set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person, if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. A court, however, generally will not intervene if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the English company in such proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

It will only be a preference if, at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the English company was unable to pay its debts. The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the English company takes the decision to grant the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction may constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been in if the preference had not been entered into.

The requirement for the English company to be unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. If the floating charge is granted to a connected person then the floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest), whether the relevant English company is solvent or insolvent at the time of grant.

Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of the over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor if the debtor is a legal person (juristische Person) or any company not having an individual as its personally liable shareholder or in the event that the debtor is illiquid, i.e. unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business is predominantly likely (positive _Fortbestehensprognose). If a legal person (juristische Person), e.g., a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—GmbH) or any company not having an individual as its personally liable shareholder, gets_ into a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the management of such company and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders are obligated to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, at the latest, within three weeks after the mandatory insolvency reason (i.e., illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness), occurred. Noncompliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the debtor currently is able to service its payment obligations, but will presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis period. However, only management of the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in case of imminent illiquidity. Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists a reason for the insolvency on the part of the relevant entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. The German Federal Ministry of Justice (Bundesjustizministerium) has released a draft Bill to Facilitate the Handling of Group Insolvencies (Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen). It is currently unclear if and when, and whether in its current or modified form, this Bill might be adopted by parliament. The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings _(Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce_ individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the court will also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has petitioned for the appointment of a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) in preparation of a debtor-in possession proceeding (Eigenverwaltung)—an insolvency process in which the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a preliminary custodian—with this petition not being obviously futile. Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations, the insolvency court must or may appoint a preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) to form a view on the profile of the officeholder to be appointed or even to make a suggestion for a particular individual to be appointed by the court. In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible; i.e., incompetent and/or not disinterested). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of 293 ----- all creditor constituencies, it shall comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The duty of the preliminary insolvency administrator is, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s assets (which includes the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor) and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Additionally, the duty of the preliminary insolvency administrator is to verify the existence of reason for insolvency. The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, particularly if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties, such as creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (usually the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court unless a debtor-inpossession proceeding (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence of a debtor-in-possession proceeding, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator upon the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly _(erste _Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount_ of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder (i.e., he or she is sufficiently qualified, businessexperienced and impartial). The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate (Masseforderung) which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim). All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings by filing their claims with the insolvency administrator. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest, entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any movable assets in his, her or the debtor’s possession that are subject to preferential rights (such as liens over movable assets _(Mobiliarsicherungsrechte), or security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims_ that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In the absence of authoritative case law, it is uncertain whether in an insolvency of the entity holding the pledged shares the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of pledged shares on their own or whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. If the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets _(Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% (or more in certain circumstances) of the_ gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any), are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator has first to satisfy the preferential creditors of the insolvency estate _(Massegläubiger) (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred_ by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other unsubordinated claims (insolvency claims) (Insolvenzforderungen), will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvent estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full. Therefore, the proceeds resulting from the realization of the insolvency estate of the debtor may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors of the German Entities or under a guarantee granted by the German Entities in full after the secured creditors have been satisfied. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. 294 ----- The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion of their amounts if ranked with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offense binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a shareholder loan or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan. While in ordinary insolvency proceedings the value of the debtor’s assets is realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the debtor’s business as a going concern, a different approach aimed at the rehabilitation of the debtor can be taken based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court. The insolvency court may order the deemed approval of one or more opposing creditor groups under certain conditions (cram down). The insolvency plan may derogate from the provisions of the German Insolvency Code. In particular, it may contain provision regarding the discharge of secured and unsecured creditors, the disposal of the insolvency estate as well as procedure. It may also create, modify, transfer or terminate rights in rem such as property rights or security interests. If the debtor is a corporate entity, the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can also be included in the insolvency plan, for example, these can be transferred to third parties, including a transfer to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. Thus, an insolvency plan could under certain circumstances provide for provisions regarding the Notes, the Guarantees or the Collateral which are less favorable to the holders of the Notes than the provisions of the German Insolvency Code, such as the release of the Collateral, the release of obligations under the Notes or the contribution of the Notes in exchange for equity. Under certain conditions, such provisions could be adopted against the votes of the affected holders of the Notes. Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on a reason for the insolvency other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate such process based on a debtor-in possession proceeding and can demonstrate that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile, the court may grant a period of up to three months to draw up an insolvency plan for the debtor business (Schutzschirmverfahren). During this period, the creditors’ rights to enforce security may—upon application of the filing debtor—be suspended. Under these circumstances, the insolvency court must appoint a preliminary custodian to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., he or she is obviously not competent or impartial). Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings _(insolvenzbezogene_ _Kündigungsrechte_ _oder _Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not_ to perform the contract. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully voided by the insolvency administrator or custodian, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act must be returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator’s or custodian’s right to avoid transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders of the Notes as well as the granting of collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or custodian under the rules of avoidance as set forth in the German Insolvency Code. In case the validity or enforceability of the Notes or any collateral in favor of the Notes is avoided successfully, you may not 295 ----- be able to recover any amounts under the Notes or the collateral. If payments have already been made under the Notes or collateral, the insolvency administrator or custodian may require that the recipients return the payment to the insolvency estate and you would instead then only have a general unsecured claim under the Notes without preference in insolvency proceedings (unless and to the extent the collateral would not be subject to avoidance in which case such claim would be secured to that extent). In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be voided according to the German Insolvency Code in the following cases: - any act granting a creditor security or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) can be voided if the transaction was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if at the time of the transaction the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig), which means such debtor was unable to pay its debt when due and the creditor had knowledge thereof or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed and the creditor had knowledge thereof or of the debtor being illiquid (or knowledge of circumstances which imperatively suggesting such illiquidity or filing); - any act granting a creditor security or satisfaction for a debt to which such creditor had no right, no right at the respective time or no right as to the respective manner, can be voided if the transaction was effected in the month prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; if the transaction was effected in the second and third month prior to the filing, it can be voided if at the time of the transaction (i) the debtor was illiquid or (ii) the creditor knew that the transaction would be detrimental to the creditors of the debtor; - any legal transaction effected by the debtor which is directly detrimental to the creditors of the debtor can be voided if the transaction was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor, if at the time of the legal transaction the debtor was illiquid and the other party to the legal transaction had knowledge thereof or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed against the debtor and the other party to the legal transaction had knowledge thereof or of the debtor being illiquid; - if an act whereby a debtor grants security for a third-party debt is regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich), such gratuitous transaction can be voided unless it was effected earlier than four years prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor; - any act performed by the debtor during a period of ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after such filing can be voided if the debtor acted with the intent to disadvantage its creditors and the beneficiary of the transaction had knowledge of such intent at the time of the transaction, with such knowledge being presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was at least imminent illiquid and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors; - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of management or the supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; - any act that provides security or satisfaction for a claim of a shareholder for the repayment of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or an economically equivalent claim can be voided (i) in the event it provided security, if the transaction was effected within the last ten years prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter or (ii) in the event it provided satisfaction, if the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter; or - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party can be voided if the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and if a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge) (in which case the shareholder must compensate the insolvency estate for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). 296 ----- For purposes of the above, the knowledge of circumstances from which a compelling conclusion regarding the debtor’s illiquidity or regarding the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings can be drawn, will be considered tantamount to the actual knowledge of the debtor’s illiquidity or of the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or custodian voiding transactions according to the German Insolvency Code described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right in accordance with the German Law of Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the voidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of voidance in the courts. In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing funding to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

The granting of guarantees, share pledges and other security by a GmbH in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company may be considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant guarantees and to create security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH or a limited liability partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) with a GmbH as its sole general partner (Komplementär) (“GmbH & Co.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the",2332.6.1,Parallel Debt/Pledges,"Under German law, certain “accessory” security interests (akzessorische Sicherheiten) such as pledges (Pfandrechte) may only be validly created in favor of the creditor(s) of the secured claims and the pledgor will need to notify the relevant debtor of a pledged claim of such pledge in order to create a valid pledge. Furthermore, the validity, extent and enforceability of a pledge are strictly linked (“accessory”) to the validity, extent and enforceability of the secured claims. In particular, a pledge may cease to exist if the claims secured by the pledge are transferred to new creditor(s) by way of novation or at a time when no amounts are outstanding under the secured claims. Therefore, the security interests granted as pledges have been created in favor of the relevant Security Agent acting in its capacity as creditor of parallel debt obligations (the “Parallel Debt”). The Parallel Debt mirrors the amount and is payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”). Payments in respect of the Principal Obligations will also discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and vice versa. Although the relevant Security Agent will have, pursuant to the Parallel Debt, a claim against us for the full principal amount of the Notes, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to enforce such security except through the relevant Security Agent and will bear some risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the relevant Security Agent. It is widely believed that a Parallel Debt can effectively be secured by a pledge. However, there are no published court decisions confirming the validity of the Parallel Debt structure and of the Collateral granted under German law to secure such Parallel Debt, and hence there is no certainty that German courts will give effect and uphold such Collateral. To the extent that parts of the Parallel Debt refer to certain future claims of certain creditors against the Issuer or certain Guarantors and to the extent these creditors and/or the nature and/or basis of their claims is not known and/or specifiable at the time of the Issuer or certain Guarantors granting the abstract acknowledgement of debt, it is uncertain whether the Parallel Debt relating thereto will be recognized by a German court. In addition, since German law does not generally allow for an appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon the occurrence of an enforcement event, an enforcement of a share pledge governed by German law usually requires the sale of the relevant Collateral through a formal disposal process involving a public auction. Certain waiting periods and notice requirements may apply for such disposal process.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

KG, its general partner’s) net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the case may be, if the net assets are already below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such amount to be further reduced. Accordingly, the Indenture, security documents and other relevant documents relating to the Guarantees and the Collateral provided by the Issuer and the German Guarantors or other German security providers will contain such limitation language and the relevant Guarantees and Collateral will be limited in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective security granted by a GmbH or GmbH & Co KG cannot be enforced at all. German capital maintenance rules are subject to ongoing court decisions. Future court rulings may further limit the access of shareholders to assets of their subsidiaries constituted in the form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make payments on the Guarantees, of the secured parties to enforce the Collateral or of the beneficiaries of the Guarantees to enforce the Guarantees. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or security granted 297 ----- by a German (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer. In such a case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. Moreover, according to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the stressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of the Guarantees and/or the Collateral by the Issuer and the German Guarantors. In addition, enforcement of the Guarantees and security interests granted by subsidiaries of the Issuer may be limited under its respective terms to the extent that it would lead to the illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the Issuer granting such Guarantee or security interest.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

In Italy, the courts play an important role in the insolvency process and in-court procedures may be materially more complex and time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy. In the event that any of Wittur Italia Holding S.r.l. and Wittur S.p.A. experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency, and/or restructuring proceedings would be commenced (depending on the actual location of the COMI), or the outcome of such proceedings. Certain provisions of Italian law have been amended or have entered into force only recently and, therefore, may be subject to further implementation and/or interpretations and have not been tested to date in the Italian courts. The two primary aims of Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 (the main Italian bankruptcy legislation), as reformed and currently in force (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”), are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and restructure its business protecting, where possible, the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claims. In case of the extraordinary administration procedure (governed by Legislative Decree No. 270 of July 8, 1999, or, upon certain eligibility criteria of the debtor, Legislative Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003, converted, with modifications, into Law No. 39 of February 18, 2004, an additional primary aim is to maintain employment. These aims have often been balanced by selling businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation, and a focus on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options. Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they become due. This must be a permanent, and not a temporary, status of insolvency in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. In cases where a company is in distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. The restructuring and bankruptcy alternatives set forth are available under Italian Bankruptcy Law to companies which are (i) facing financial difficulties, (ii) in a state of temporary crisis or (iii) insolvent.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a state of crisis (i.e., facing distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. The agreement with creditors is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication. Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any interim relief or enforcement actions over the assets of the debtor and cannot obtain any security interest (unless agreed) in relation to pre-existing debts. Pursuant to the Law Decree No. 78 of May 31, 2010, such moratorium can be requested, pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, by the debtor from the court during negotiations with creditors (i.e. prior to the above-mentioned publication of the agreement), subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions. The moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication.

The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed with the court, without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The agreement and the attached plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party and may contain, refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

Before the expiry of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182 bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). Pursuant to the Law Decree 69/2013, the court, if it accepts such preliminary petition, may appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities referred under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g. concealment of part of assets, fraudulent omission to report one or more claims, declaration of non-existent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), shall report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo, and, upon request of one or more creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, adjudicate the company in bankruptcy. The debtor company may not file such pre application where it had already done so in the previous two years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed or the validation of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors having occurred. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation referred above contains also the periodical information requirements (relating also to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the composition proposal and the relevant plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company shall file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the companies’ register. Non-compliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the drafting of the composition proposal and the relevant plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its extraordinary activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company in the time frame above are “pre-deductible” claims (crediti prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are exempted from the clawback action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The plan attached to the composition proposal may provide for (i) the continuation of the debtor company’s business as a going concern, or (ii) the transfer of the business to one or more companies (concordato con continuità aziendale). The said plan may also provide for the sale of any assets which are no 301 ----- longer necessary to run the business. In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenues which are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert—in addition to assessing the feasibility of the agreement and the truthfulness of the debtor accounts and financial reports—shall also certify that the continuation of the business is in the creditors’ interest. The composition agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to supervise the procedure and one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company continues to be managed by its director/directors, but he/they is/are supervised by the appointed judicial officers and the judge (who shall authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business). The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved by the majority (by value of claims) of the creditors entitled to vote and, if creditors are divided in classes, by the majority of the creditors included in the majority of the classes. Creditors who have not voted will be deemed to approve the _concordato preventivo proposal if they fail to notify their objection via telegraph, fax, mail or e mail to such_ proposal within 20 days from the closure of the minutes of that creditors’ meeting. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the _concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured_ assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless approve the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order.

The main effects of the extraordinary receivership proceedings can be summarized as follows: (i) the outstanding claims vis-à-vis the company are frozen as of the date of the declaration of the insolvency status of the company and shall be paid in accordance with the statutory priorities provided by the law (as would occur in a bankruptcy proceedings); (ii) individual creditors (including secured creditors) enforcement actions are barred but creditors secured by pledge may be authorized by the Court to sell the pledged assets; (iii) the company is managed by the Commissioner/s and continues to carry on its ordinary business activities; and (iv) the agreements entered into by the insolvent company remain effective and may not be terminated by the counterparties on the basis of the default of the insolvent company. Conversely, the Commissioner/ s is/are entitled, at its/their discretion, to terminate any agreement already executed by the insolvent company, unless the obligations arising from such agreement have already been fulfilled by one of the parties thereto. If during the one-year period (in case of Sale Plan) or the two-year period (in case of Restructuring Plan) the Commissioner/s or the court deems that the Plans are no longer feasible, the court adjudicates the company in bankruptcy. Unlike the other insolvency proceedings, the Legislative Decree No. 270 of July 8, 1999 provides that all insolvent business entities (also other than companies) controlled by, controlling, or under the common control of, the company first admitted to extraordinary receivership, are admitted to extraordinary receivership, even if not eligible, rather than declared bankrupt, provided that: (a) such other “group” entities may be reorganized on a “stand alone” basis; or (b) the objectives of the selected plan may be better pursued by a common management of the “group” insolvency. The procedures remain separate, but the extraordinary receiver(s) is the same. For the sake of completeness, please note that, further to the latest financial crisis involving major Italian groups, the Legislative Decree No. 347 of December 23, 2003 (converted, with modifications, into Law No. 39 of February 18, 2004) introduced a new extraordinary receivership proceedings (the so called “Marzano",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

The bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met (i.e., the company has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, or gross revenues (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years or total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million). On the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings: - subject to certain exceptions, creditors are prevented from individually taking any legal actions against the debtor and no individual payments of credit are allowed. Ally credits are considered overdue and accrual of interests on the creditors’ claims is suspended. Creditors must file their claims against the debtor by submitting a proof of claim before the competent bankruptcy court within the term assigned to them, and the designated judge (giudice delegato) may decide whether to admit the said claims into the bankruptcy liabilities. Under certain circumstances secured creditors may enforce against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted into bankruptcy liabilities as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interests and expenses. Any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. The secured creditor may sell the secured asset only after it has obtained authorization from the designated judge (giudice delegato) that, after hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee (comitato dei creditori), decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing, terms and conditions; - the administration of the debtor company and the management of its assets pass from the debtor company to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare); - any act of the debtor company done after the declaration of bankruptcy (including payments) is ineffective against the creditors; - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors; and - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed by each of the parties, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court appointed bankruptcy receiver, a designated judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of any one of the creditors, but is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor for the satisfaction of the creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real property. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of Italian law (and, as a consequence, it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by applicable law).",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

The debtor or its subsidiaries are only permitted to file such proposal after one year following such declaration, and no later 304 ----- than two years following the decree giving effectiveness to the bankruptcy liabilities (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The proposal may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatment among the classes), the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The concordato fallimentare proposal must be submitted to the bankruptcy receiver and to the creditors’ committee and—should the proposal split the creditors in different classes—it must also be reviewed by the bankruptcy court. Then, the concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the majority of the creditors admitted to vote and if creditors are divided in different classes, by the majority of the creditors included in the majority of the classes.

Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from the rules of statutory priority by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles (as a consequence it must be noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements may not be enforceable against an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire bankruptcy assets of part thereof, or from a single asset. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “pre deductible” claims (crediti prededucibili) (i.e., claims defined as “pre-deductible” claims by a specific provision of law or arose in or with a view to the insolvency proceedings, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims (creditori chirografari). Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors including, inter _alia, a claim whose priority is legally acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing, mentioned above),_ the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security authorities, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priority claims are those of “privileged” creditors (creditori privilegiati) having a priority in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgagees (creditori ipotecari) and pledgees (creditori prignoratizi). Privileged claims are paid out of the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interest and expenses.

For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Italian Insolvency Laws” above. If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the receiver. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents. In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to revoke or declare ineffective pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (azione revocatoria ordinaria) the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. 305 ----- An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings: - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and - that, in the case of non gratuitous act, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent design. Furthermore, under fraudulent conveyance and other provisions of Italian law, a court could void or invalidate all or a portion of the obligations of a guarantor under the relevant guarantee and, if payment had already been made under that guarantee, require the recipients of that payment to return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that, inter alia: (i) the relevant guarantor gave such guarantee with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or when the beneficiary of the guarantee was aware that the relevant guarantor was insolvent when it gave the relevant guarantee; (ii) the relevant guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for its guarantee or the relevant guarantor was insolvent at the time the guarantee was given; (iii) the relevant guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant guarantor or not to be in the best interest or for the corporate benefit of the relevant guarantor; or (iv) the guarantor giving such guarantee was aware, or should have been aware, that the transaction was to the detriment of the creditors. If a court decided either that a guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, the beneficiary of the guarantee may cease to have any claim with respect to the relevant guarantor. The same would also apply to any security interest. In any case, it should be noted that: (i) under article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, all transactions for no consideration, depending on certain circumstances, are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration; and (ii) under article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors (and could therefore be clawed back), if performed by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the declaration of insolvency. Payments or grants of securities and/or other transactions are exempted from claw back or avoidance provisions when made in accordance with (a) out-of-court restructuring plans pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, (b) agreements to restructure indebtedness (“accordi di ristrutturazione dei _debiti”) under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or (c) court supervised pre-bankruptcy composition_ with creditors (“concordato preventivo”), including concordato con continuità aziendale and concordato con _riserva._ In addition, it should be noted that the Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the E.U.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

If a security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition, financial assistance issues may also be triggered. _Corporate Benefit_ An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee) must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for it. The concept of a real and adequate benefit is not specifically defined in the applicable legislation and is determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis. 306 ----- As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate corporate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee) ultra vires and potentially affected by conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities also may be imposed on the directors of the company if it is assessed that they did not act in the interest of it and that the acts they carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also lead to civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over the Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the company. The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to upstream/crossstream/downstream security interest or guarantees granted by Italian companies. In relation to security interests or guarantees, while corporate benefit for a downstream security or guarantee (i.e., a security or a guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) can usually be easily proved, it is more complex to prove the existence of a real and adequate benefit for an upstream or cross stream security or guarantee (i.e., a security interest or a guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) to be granted by an entity organized under the laws of Italy. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security or guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. In particular, in case of upstream and cross stream security interests or guarantees for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of that group. _Financial Assistance_ Save for specific exceptions, it is unlawful under Italian laws for a company to give financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company, and any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. Financial assistance to refinance indebtedness incurred by a company to purchase or subscribe for its own shares or quotes or those of its direct or indirect parent company might also be considered as falling within the scope of Italian financial assistance provisions. More specifically, Italian rules on financial assistance, provided under articles 2358 and 2474 of the Italian Civil Code, prohibit the grant by the Guarantors organized in Italy (the “Italian Guarantors”) of guarantees in respect of indebtedness incurred for the acquisition (or the refinancing of the acquisition) of such Guarantors’ own shares or quotas, or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls such Guarantors. In light of these rules, the liability of each Italian Guarantor under its guarantee of the Notes is expressly limited to an amount corresponding to the principal amount of the financial indebtedness of the relevant Italian Guarantor to be repaid through the proceeds of the Notes. This “virtual tranching” structure (i.e., whereby the relevant portion of the proceeds of the Notes which do not constitute “acquisition debt” and, therefore, do not fall within the prohibition under Italian financial assistance rules, are identified, but not actually separated into a separate tranche of financial indebtedness) is untested in Italian courts. Therefore, it may be deemed insufficient for clearly distinguishing and separating the non-“acquisition debt” portion of the proceeds of the Notes distributed to Italian Guarantors, and it may result in the Guarantees violating the provisions of articles 2358 and 2474 of the Italian Civil Code. If an Italian court determined that such a violation had occurred, it would result in the guarantees by the Italian Guarantors being null and void, which would mean that holders of the Notes would have no recourse to the assets of the Italian Guarantors and no claim against the Italian Guarantors in an insolvency or other scenario. Subject to the foregoing, the Guarantees by the Italian Guarantors (Wittur Italia Holding s.r.l. and Wittur S.p.A.) are expected to be limited to €5.0 million and €1.0 million, respectively (based on a Completion Date of March 31, 2015). The limitation of the Italian Guarantees will be calculated as a percentage of the intercompany proceeds loans used to refinance existing indebtedness of our Italian subsidiaries and could be higher or lower, depending on the amount of outstanding local debt on the actual Completion Date. However, we cannot provide any assurances that holders of the Notes will be able to recover even these amounts under such Guarantees, as 307 ----- payment under each Guarantee is contractually subordinated to all the senior indebtedness of such Guarantor, including such Guarantor’s obligations under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Although case law is not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted that the following requirements must be met in order for a creditor to bring such action: - the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took place after such debt was created; - the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third party; - such act was fraudulent; - there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages suffered; and - debtor’s insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the debtor’s estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim. The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements under Spanish law for the action to rescind to succeed. Pursuant to Article 1,297 of the Spanish Civil Code: (i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration, and (ii) transfers for consideration carried out by parties who have been held liable by a court (sentencia condenatoria) or whose assets have been subject to a writ of attachment (mandamiento de embargo) will be considered fraudulent.

(the “Spanish Guarantor”), is incorporated under the laws of Spain. In the event of insolvency, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Spain. The insolvency laws of Spain may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States, the United Kingdom or other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Spain. In the event that we, or any of our subsidiaries, experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to know with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that has jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the member state (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “centre of main interest” as the term is used in article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Where a company conducts business in more than one member state of the European Union, the jurisdiction of the relevant courts may be limited if the company’s “centre of main interests” is found to be in a member state other than its place of incorporation. There are a number of factors that are taken into account to ascertain the centre of main interests, which should correspond to the place where the company conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties. The point at which this issue will be determined is at the time when the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. The determination of where the Issuer or any of the Guarantors has its “centre of main interests” would be a question of fact on which the courts of the different European Union member states may have differing and even conflicting views. It should also be noted that a limited number of final decisions have been taken in cases that have been brought before the European Court of Justice in relation to questions of interpretation or the effects of the EU Insolvency Regulation throughout the European Union. Furthermore, “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time. The Law 22/2003, of July 9, on Insolvency (Ley 22/2003, de 9 de julio, Concursal, ), as amended from time to time (the “Spanish Insolvency Law”) regulates court insolvency proceedings in Spain. Insolvency proceedings in Spain, which are known as “concurso de acreedores”, are applicable to all persons and entities, except public entities. The debtor may file for insolvency (or file with the insolvency court a communication under 5 Bis of Spanish Insolvency Law informing that it has commenced negotiations with its creditors to agree a refinancing agreement or an advanced proposal of settlement agreement (convenio), to obtain an additional period of three months to negotiate with its creditors[5]) as a protective measure in order to avoid the attachment of its assets or suspension of certain enforcement actions that could be taken by its creditors. These proceedings may lead either to a composition agreement (convenio de acreedores) with creditors (which may include the restructuring of the business of the debtor) or to the liquidation of the assets of the debtor. Insolvency is considered voluntary (concurso voluntario) if filed by the debtor. A debtor (and, in the case of a company, its directors (órgano de administración)) is required to apply for insolvency proceedings when it is not regularly able to meet its current payment obligations on a general basis (insolvencia actual). The debtor is also entitled to apply for such insolvency proceedings when it expects that it will shortly be unable to meet its current payment obligations on a general basis (insolvency inminente). The debtor is obliged to file a petition for insolvency within two months after it becomes aware, or should have become aware, of its state of insolvency. It is presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its insolvency, unless otherwise proved, if any of the circumstances that qualify as the basis for a petition for mandatory insolvency occur. Insolvency is considered mandatory (concurso necesario) if filed by other than the debtor, such as creditors and other interested third parties. Under Spanish Insolvency Law, creditors may also apply for a debtor’s insolvency if they can prove to the court, inter alia: (i) a generalized default on payments of its current obligations when due by the debtor; (ii) a seizure of assets affecting or comprising the generality of the debtor’s assets; (iii) a misplacement, “fire sale” or ruinous liquidation of the debtor’s assets; or (iv) a generalized default on certain tax, social security and employment obligations during the applicable statutory period (three months prior to the filing of the relevant insolvency request). 5 There is one month to file for insolvency after the three-month negotiation period has elapsed. 308 ----- Upon a filing for insolvency proceedings, the court issues an insolvency order containing an express request for the creditors of the insolvent debtor to declare all debts owed to them by the debtor, providing original documentation to justify such debts, within a period of one month after the announcement of the insolvency declaration in the Spanish Official Gazette (Boletín Oficial del Estado). Based on the documentation provided by the creditors and documentation held by the debtor, insolvency administrator draws up a list of acknowledged creditors (together with a list of assets of the insolvent company) and classifies them according to the categories established under the law: - debts benefiting from special privileges, representing security interests on certain assets (in essence, in _rem sureties). The amount of debt benefiting from special privileges is limited to the collateral assets as_ valued according to certain criteria described in the Spanish Insolvency Law. The rest (deficiency claim) will have the ranking that would have corresponded to it if had not been secured by an in rem security. The value of the in rem security will be that resulting from deducting from nine-tenths of the fair value (as defined in the Spanish Insolvency Law) of the asset or right over which the security is granted, any outstanding debts enjoying a preferential security over the same asset. The value cannot be less than zero or greater than the value of the privileged claim or the value of the maximum mortgage or pledge liability which might have been agreed. Privileged creditors can be subject to the composition agreement in the event that a special majority is achieved. Further, unless subject to Royal Decree-law 5/2005, the enforcement of the security interests securing these credits is subject to certain restrictions derived from a waiting period that may last up to one year unless the relevant charged asset is not necessary for the debtor’s professional or business activity. In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against the assets on which their debt is secured; - debts benefiting from general privileges, including, among others, labour, tort and public debts. General privileges for public debt (other than debt relating to tax withholdings and certain social security obligations, which are recognized in full) are recognized for one-half of the amount of the debt. General privileges are also recognized for half of the amount of debt held by the first creditor to apply for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor (should that application be successful). Despite the transitory regime of the Spanish Insolvency Act which currently applies (discussed below), as a general principle new monies granted under a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71.bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Law in the amount not admitted as a debt against the insolvency estate (“crédito contra la masa”) will also be recognized as credits with general privilege. Creditors whose debt benefits from general privileges can be affected by the composition agreement in the event that a special majority is achieved. In the event of liquidation, they collect payment after the full payment of the claims against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la masa) out of the assets of the debtor which are not subject to security; - ordinary debts (non-subordinated and non-privileged creditors). Creditors of ordinary debt will be paid after claims benefiting from general privileges have been completely paid up and on a pro rata basis vis-à-vis each other and together with the amount (deficiency claim) not covered by the proceeds obtained in the foreclosure of the assets securing the special privileged credits. If the debtor achieves a composition agreement, the ordinary credits will be affected; and - subordinated debts (classified as such by virtue of the underlying credit agreement or pursuant to law). Subordinated debts include, among others, debts held by parties in special relationships with the debtor (insiders), such as, in the case of a legal entity, debts held by the directors (either appointed directors or _de facto directors (administradores de hecho o de derecho)), general attorneys (apoderados generales)_ of the debtor, group companies, their common shareholders, and any direct or indirect shareholders holding more than 5% (for companies which have issued securities listed on an official secondary market) or 10% (for companies which have not issued securities listed in an official secondary market) of the debtor’s share capital. However, creditors who have directly or indirectly capitalized their credit rights pursuant to a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71.bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Law shall not be considered as being in a special relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor resulting from such refinancing arrangement. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the assignees of debt formerly owned by any of the abovementioned persons which acquired such debt within the two year period the insolvency declaration are presumed to be persons specially related to the insolvent debtor and, therefore, their claim shall be subordinated. Subordinated creditors are not entitled to vote on the composition agreement (convenio) and, although they are bound by it, in practice usually have very limited chances of collection, as a result of the ranking established by law. For the sake of completeness, we should also refer to claims against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la _masa). Claims against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la masa) are not considered part of the debtor’s_ 309 ----- general debt insolvency claims (créditos concursales) and are payable when due according to their own terms (and, therefore, apart from privileged claims are paid before other debts under insolvency proceedings). Claims against the insolvency estate include, among others, (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll, (ii) costs and expenses of the insolvency proceedings, (iii) certain amounts arising from services provided by to the insolvent debtor under reciprocal contracts and outstanding obligations that remain in force after insolvency proceedings are declared and deriving from obligations to return and indemnify in cases of voluntary termination or breach by the insolvent debtor, (iv) those amounts that derive from the exercise of a claw-back action within the insolvency proceedings of acts performed by the insolvent debtor and correspond to a refund of consideration received by it (except in cases of bad faith), (v) certain amounts arising from obligations created by law or from the noncontractual liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of insolvency and until its conclusion, (vi) certain debts incurred by the debtor following the declaration of insolvency; (vii) in case of liquidation, the credit rights granted to the debtor under a composition agreement in accordance with article 100.5 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, and (viii) 100% of the new funds lent under a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in article 71.bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Law, provided that it has been entered into after March 9, 2014; and (ix) 100% of the new funds lent by persons being in a special relationship with the debtor in the context of a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in article 71.bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Law, provided that such arrangement has been entered into after March 9, 2014 and provided further that such new funds do not result from a share capital increase. As from March 10, 2016 only 50% of the new funds referred to in subsection (viii) will be considered as claims against the insolvency estate, and funds referred to in subsection (ix) will no longer be considered as claims against the insolvency estate. As a general rule, the debtor in a voluntary insolvency retains its management power, but is subject to the intervention of the insolvency administrator (administrador concursal) (receiver), who is appointed by the court. In the case of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor’s management will be replaced by the insolvency trustee. However, the court has the power to modify this general regime subject to the specific circumstances of the case. A declaration of insolvency does not affect agreements with reciprocal obligations pending performance by either the insolvent party or the counterparty (executory contracts), which remain in full force and effect, and the obligations of the insolvent debtor will be fulfilled against the insolvent estate. The court can nonetheless terminate any such contracts at the request of the insolvency trustee, the company itself or the non-debtor when such termination is in the interest of the insolvency estate or if there has been a breach of such contract. The termination of such contracts may result in the insolvent debtor having to return or indemnify its counterpart, being this claim classified as a claim against the insolvency estate. Although the creditors may be able to accelerate the maturity of claims based only on the declaration of insolvency (declaración de concurso) if so agreed, they cannot terminate executory contracts (except if expressly permitted by specific laws, i.e. agency law). Any provision to the contrary will be null and void. Additionally, the declaration of insolvency determines that interest accrual is suspended, except credit rights secured with an in rem right, in which case interest accrues up to the value of the security, and except for any wage credits in favor of employees, which will accrue the legal interest set forth in the corresponding Law of the State Budget (Ley de Presupuestos del Estado). Pursuant to article 55 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law, enforcement actions in process shall be suspended from the date of the declaration of the insolvency proceedings; notwithstanding the dealing of the respective claims within the insolvency proceedings. Additionally, once the insolvency proceedings are declared, singular, judicial or extrajudicial enforcements may not be initiated against the debtor, nor may administrative or tax demands for payment to be collected coercively against the assets of the debtor be continued (although certain exceptions apply). Notwithstanding the foregoing and pursuant to articles 55 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law referred to above, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and creditors, the law extends the jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency proceedings, which is, then, legally authorized to handle any enforcement proceedings or interim measures (medidas cautelares) affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor or administrative law). Pursuant to article 56 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, creditors with a security in rem against the insolvent debtor’s assets which are necessary for his professional or business activity, may not enforce the security until a composition agreement is reached whose content does not affect exercise of that right, or until one year elapses from declaring the insolvency proceedings open without the winding-up having commenced. This does not apply if the security interest is subject to Royal Decree-law 5/2005. 310 ----- Furthermore, the enforcement proceedings of security in rem already commenced shall be suspended from the date of the declaration of the insolvency proceedings in the same terms set forth in article 55 of the Spanish Insolvency Law. Under the Spanish Insolvency Law, there is no automatic “claw-back date”, meaning there are no prior transactions that automatically become void as a result of the initiation of insolvency proceedings. Rather, insolvency administrators (or creditors if the insolvency administrator rejects to do so) may only challenge transactions that could be deemed as having “damaged” the insolvency estate, provided that such transactions have taken place within two years prior to the declaration of insolvency (transactions taking place earlier than two years before the insolvency proceedings has been declared may be rescinded subject to ordinary Spanish Civil Code based actions). Those transactions that are classified as “ordinary” transactions in the course of the business of the debtor are not subject to challenge. The Spanish Insolvency Law does not define the meaning of “patrimonial damage.” “Damage” does not refer to the intention of the parties but to the consequences of a given transaction on the debtor’s interest which results on the damage to the insolvent debtor’s estate (absence of reasonable equivalent value) or the prejudice to the equality of the treatment among creditors which drives insolvency proceedings (par _condition creditorum). In any case, the Spanish Insolvency Law refers to certain transactions that are deemed by_ operation of law as damaging to the company’s estate: damage exists (as a non-rebuttable presumption), among others, in case of donations and early payment of non-secured obligations maturing after the insolvency declaration; and damage is deemed to exist (as a rebuttable presumption), among others, where a transaction is entered into with a party having a special relationship with the debtor, early payment of secured obligations maturing after insolvency declaration, and when rights in rem have been created in order to protect already existing (non-secured) obligations. In cases in which damage is not presumed, proof of damage is required. If the claw-back action is successful, reciprocal restitution of the consideration will be ordered, along with any benefit and interest accrued (as long as the avoided agreement is an executory contract). When it is no longer possible to return the item received, the cash equivalent of its value must be delivered. The obligation arising from the action for restoration is considered a credit against the insolvency estate (provided that the agreement is an executory contract), unless the third party is held to have acted in bad faith, in which case the credit due to the restoration will be considered as subordinate. Specific types of refinancing agreements are protected from claw-back actions, including the guarantees and security interest granted in execution of such agreements. Article 71 bis and 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Law provides the requirements for such refinancing agreement to be protected from clawback.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

When declared bankrupt, a receiver in bankruptcy (konkursförvaltare) is appointed by the court and will work in the interest of all creditors with the objective of realizing the debtor’s assets and distributing the proceeds among the creditors. The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings is to wind up the company in such a way that the company’s creditors receive as high a proportion of their claims as possible. The receiver in bankruptcy is required to safeguard the assets and can decide to continue the business or to close it down, depending on what is deemed preferable for all the creditors. In general, the receiver in bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the debtor as soon as possible and to distribute the proceeds in accordance with statutory rules. In the interim, the receiver will take over the management and control of the company and the company’s directors and/or managing director will no longer be entitled to represent the company or dispose of the company’s assets. All creditors (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the bankruptcy estate) wishing to assert claims against the company that is declared bankrupt need to participate in the bankruptcy proceedings. 313 ----- _Effect of Bankruptcy on the Bankruptcy Debtor’s Contracts_ The declaration of bankruptcy does not automatically terminate existing contracts; instead, the receiver may, in relation to certain contracts, in its discretion choose to have the bankruptcy estate itself become party to any such existing contracts. A clause in such a contract which provides that the contract is terminated by reason of a bankruptcy petition or similar proceeding is likely to be deemed unenforceable. If the estate enters into such a contract and performance by the counterparty is due, the counterparty may generally demand that the estate perform its obligations as well or, if a grace period has been granted, request that the estate, without unreasonable delay, provides acceptable security for its performance. If performance by the counterparty is not due, the counterparty may request security where this is necessary in order to protect the counterparty against loss. If the estate does not enter into the contract within a reasonable time after the counterparty’s demand or if it does not comply with the counterparty’s request to provide security, the counterparty may terminate the contract. _Order of Priorities_ When distributing the proceeds, the receiver must follow the mandatory provisions of the Swedish Rights of Priority Act (1970:979), as amended (the “Swedish Rights of Priority Act”), which states the order in which creditors have a right to be paid. As a general principle, in bankruptcy proceedings competing claims have equal right to payment, in relation to the size of the amount claimed, from the debtor’s assets. However, preferential or secured creditors, where such preference follows by law, have the benefit of payment before other creditors. There are two types of preferential rights: specific and general preferential rights. Specific preferential rights are vested in certain specific property (see below) and give the creditor right to payment out of such property. Such preferential and secured creditors may also under certain circumstances enforce the security in accordance with the Swedish Enforcement Act (1981:774), or if the security is provided by way of a pledge on movable assets (handpanträtt), enforcement through private enforcement procedures as permitted pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act. General preferential rights cover all property belonging to the insolvent company’s estate in bankruptcy, which is not covered by specific preferential rights. Claims that do not carry any of the abovementioned preferential rights or exceed the value of the security provided for such claim (to the extent of such excess), are non-preferential and are of equal standing as against each other.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

A petition for company reorganization may be presented by the debtor or a creditor of the debtor. If a creditor petitions for company reorganization, the debtor’s consent to the reorganization is required. Prerequisites for an approval of a petition for company reorganization is that it can be assumed that the debtor is unable to pay its due debts or such inability will occur shortly and there is a possibility that the reorganization will be successful in resolving the company’s financial difficulties. Corporate reorganization proceedings may as a main rule continue for an initial period of three months from commencement but may, under certain conditions, be extended for up to one year. _Administrator_ An administrator (rekonstruktör) is appointed by the court and supervises the day-to-day activities and safeguards the interests of creditors as well as the debtor. However, the debtor remains in full possession of the business except that, for important decisions such as paying a debt that has arisen prior to the order of reorganization, granting security for a debt that arose prior to the order, undertaking new obligations or transferring, pledging or granting rights in respect of assets of a substantial value for the business, the consent of the administrator is required. However, the absence of such consent does not affect the validity of the transaction. _Reorganization Plan, Creditors Meeting and Creditor’s Committee_ Upon an order by the court under the Swedish Reorganization Act, the administrator must notify the creditors of the reorganization proceedings and will draw up a reorganization plan specifying the proposed action to be taken to resolve the debtor’s problems. A creditors’ meeting will be held at which the creditors will be given the opportunity to express their opinions as to whether the reorganization should continue. Upon the request of any of the creditors, the court shall appoint a creditors’ committee of at most three persons. The administrator shall, if possible, consult with the creditors’ committee prior to taking any important decisions. _Moratorium_ The corporate reorganization proceedings do not have the effect of terminating existing contracts with the debtor. Furthermore, the opening of corporate reorganization proceedings entails limitations on the contracting 314 ----- party’s right to terminate a contract, e.g. due to the debtor’s delay in payment. Such limitations are similar to what is stated above in respect of a bankruptcy estate’s right to enter into existing contracts. However, the limitations are not applicable where a creditor has security over, inter alia, financial instruments or receivables originating from a loan granted by a credit institution. During the reorganization procedure, the debtor’s business activities continue as normal. However, the procedure includes a suspension of payments to creditors and the debtor cannot pay a debt that arose prior to the order of reorganization without the consent of the administrator and such consent may only be granted should there be exceptional reasons for doing so and any petition for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor will be stayed. A moratorium also applies to execution in respect of a claim or enforcement of security during corporate reorganization proceedings unless the security assets are in the physical possession of the secured creditor or any agent acting on behalf of such creditor, which is the case with a Swedish law share pledge over the shares in a Swedish limited liability company where the share certificates of such company have been physically delivered to the agent. The debtor may apply to the court requesting public composition proceedings (offentligt ackord), which means that the amount of a creditor’s claim may be reduced. The proposal for a public composition must meet certain requirements such as that a sufficient proportion of the creditors which are allowed to vote, in respect of a sufficient proportion of the outstanding claims, vote in favor of such public composition. Creditors with set-off rights and secured creditors will not participate in the composition unless they wholly or partly waive their setoff rights or priority rights. Should the security not cover a secured creditor’s full claim, the remaining claim will, however, be part of a composition. A creditors’ meeting is convened to vote on the proposed composition. The public composition is a binding proceeding on all creditors that were entitled to participate, i.e. also creditors who have not attended the creditors meeting will be bound.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

The same obligation arises if the company in connection with enforcement pursuant to Chapter 4 of the Swedish Enforcement Code (1981:774) is found to lack sizable assets. If the special balance sheet shows that the equity of such company is less than half of the registered share capital, the board of directors shall, as soon as possible, issue notice to call a shareholders’ meeting which shall consider whether the company shall go into liquidation (initial shareholders’ meeting). The special balance sheet and an auditor’s report with respect thereto shall be presented at the initial shareholders’ meeting. If the special balance sheet presented at the initial shareholders’ meeting fails to show that, on the date of such meeting, the equity of the company amounts to the registered share capital and the initial shareholders’ meeting has not resolved that the company shall go into liquidation, the shareholders’ meeting shall, within eight months of the initial shareholders’ meeting, reconsider the issue whether the company shall go into liquidation (second shareholders’ meeting). Prior to the second shareholders’ meeting, the board of directors shall prepare a new special balance sheet and cause such to be reviewed by the company’s auditors. The new special balance sheet and an auditor’s report thereon shall be presented at the second shareholders’ meeting. A shareholders’ resolution on liquidation of the company shall be registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Bolagsverket), which shall appoint a liquidator. Should the shareholders not resolve on such voluntary liquidation where required (which are where (i) a second shareholders’ meeting is not held within the period of time stated above, or (ii) the new special balance sheet which was presented at the second shareholders’ meeting was not reviewed by the company’s auditor or fails to show that, on the date of such meeting, the equity of the company amounts to at least the registered share capital), the court may put the company into compulsory liquidation and appoint a liquidator. The liquidator takes over management and control of the company and shall sell the company’s assets and settle the company’s debts with the proceeds. The liquidator shall give notice to the company’s unknown creditors and creditors that have not lodged their claims with the liquidator within six months following such notice will have forfeited their rights to their claims. If the board of directors fails to comply with the requirements relating to liquidation due to capital deficiency (such as failure to prepare a special balance sheet and have the auditors examine it in case there are reasons to assume that the company’s equity is less than half of its registered share capital), the members of the board of directors may be liable for obligations incurred by the company during the period of such failure to act. Also, any person who conducts business on the company’s behalf with knowledge of the board of directors’ failure to act may incur a similar liability. Liability shall however not be incurred by any person (including any member of the board of directors) who proves that he or she was not negligent. 315 -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

This could be the case if, at the time the guarantee or security interest for the obligations of a third party is provided, (i) the obligor of such obligation could be deemed unable to fulfill its obligation to indemnify the Swedish Company if the guarantee is utilized or the security enforced and/or (ii) a Swedish company provides any security interest or guarantee in respect of debt owed by a non-subsidiary of that Swedish company without receiving sufficient corporate benefit in return. The guarantees provided by a Swedish Company are limited in accordance with the above restrictions relating to corporate benefit and are subject to limitation language limiting the liability of such entities thereunder if required by the abovementioned restrictions relating to the distribution of assets. _Financial Assistance_ The Swedish Companies Act also prohibits a Swedish Company from providing a guarantee or security interest for a loan that is provided to facilitate the acquisition of shares in the Swedish Company or any other superior member of the same Swedish group of companies and a Swedish Company may not provide a guarantee or any security for the obligations of a parent or sister company, unless the parent company of the group, to which the company and such parent or sister company belongs, is domiciled within the EEA. The guarantees provided by a Swedish Company are limited in accordance with the above restrictions relating to financial assistance in respect of the acquisition of shares in a Swedish Company or any other superior member of the same Swedish group of companies and are subject to limitation language limiting the liability of such entities thereunder if required by the abovementioned restrictions relating to such financial assistance.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

The goods or monies shall then be re-distributed to the bankruptcy estate or the company subject to company reorganization. Broadly, these transactions include, among others, situations where the debtor has conveyed property fraudulently or preferentially to one creditor to the detriment of one or more of its other creditors before the initiation of the relevant insolvency proceedings, created a new security interest, granted a guarantee or security that was either not stipulated at the time when the secured obligation arose or not perfected without delay after such time and the delay is not considered to be ordinary or paid a debt that is not due or that is considerable compared to the value of the debtor’s assets or which is made by using unusual means of payment. In the majority of situations, a claim for recovery can be made concerning actions which were made during the three months preceding the commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings, notably in relation to such granting of security where perfection is delayed. In certain situations longer time limits apply and in others there are no time limits. These include, among others, situations where the other party to an agreement or other arrangement is deemed to be a closely related party to the debtor, such as a subsidiary or parent company. _Foreign Currency_ Swedish courts may award judgments in currencies other than Swedish kronor, but the judgment debtor has the right to pay judgment debt, even though denominated in a foreign currency, in Swedish kronor at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of payment. 316 -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Direct bankruptcy can be demanded by the creditors or the debtor. A creditor can apply for direct bankruptcy where (inter alia): - the debtor engages or attempts to engage in fraudulent acts breaching the rights of its creditors; - the debtor conceals its property during compulsory execution by way of attachment; - the debtor has suspended its payments; - ten days have passed since the announcement of the termination of a restructuring project; - a concordat is not approved, the concordat period is cancelled, or the concordat is completely dissolved; - the creditor’s claim based on a court decision has not been paid although its payment has been demanded pursuant to an order of execution; or - the debtor company’s debts exceed its current assets. Direct bankruptcy may also take place at the debtor’s request. A debtor can apply to a court to declare itself bankrupt. This can occur in two circumstances: _Voluntary Bankruptcy_ When the board of directors of a debtor discovers from the previous year’s annual balance sheet the erosion of 1⁄2 of the sum of the company’s share capital and statutory reserves, then the board of directors must immediately call an extraordinary general assembly meeting together with a proposal for remedial measures to be submitted to general assembly’s approval in order to strengthen the debtor’s financial status. When a company suffers losses which reduce its paid up share capital and statutory reserves by two-thirds, the board of directors is required to call an extraordinary general assembly meeting. At this meeting, the shareholders must resolve either to compensate the company in cash for the accumulated loss or to decrease the company’s paid-up share capital 317 ----- to one-third of its existing share capital. If any of these resolutions is not adopted at the meeting or if a meeting is not convened at all, the company would be deemed dissolved pursuant to the Turkish Execution and Bankruptcy Law and the Turkish Commercial Code. If the shareholders do not take one of these steps, the board of directors is required to file a lawsuit before the relevant commercial court to request the court to declare the company bankrupt. If the board of directors fail to take such action, the directors shall be personally and jointly and severally liable for any and all real damages, incurred by the creditors and the shareholders of such company. _Mandatory Bankruptcy_ The debtor must apply to a court for bankruptcy if: - an attachment is ordered against a debtor which results in the debtor losing one-half of its assets; and - the debtor’s remaining assets are insufficient to meet its other debts which will be due and payable within one year.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Three types of voidable transactions are (i) transactions made at an undervalue, (ii) inappropriate transactions and (iii) transactions that constitute an intentional creditor defraud. _Undervalue Transactions_ Contracts under which the consideration is materially less than the relevant market price may be declared void by a court if they were entered into within two years prior to the commencement of insolvency/bankruptcy. _Inappropriate Transactions_ The following transactions are considered inappropriate and may thus be set aside if they were entered into within one year prior to insolvency/bankruptcy: (a) the provision of security by the debtor where the debtor provided security to secure debt already existing and had not agreed earlier to do so; (b) any benefits granted by the debtor not granted in cash or by other usual means of payment; (c) any repayment of debt which is not yet due; and (d) transfers and registrations in relation to the land register strengthening the other party’s contractual position. However, the court may not set aside such transactions where the party benefiting from the transaction is able to prove that, when entering into the transaction, it acted in good faith as regards the debtor’s financial condition. _Creditor Defraud_ Transfers made by the debtor intentionally against the creditors’ interests may also be set aside if made within five years before the bankruptcy petition was filed. To have such transfers declared void by a court, the claimant, i.e. usually the bankruptcy administration has to prove that the transferee, when entering into the transaction, knew or should have known the debtor’s financial condition and also knew or should have known that the debtor acted in violation of the principle of good faith.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

For ordinary and special bankruptcy proceedings before the commercial court, the bankruptcy petition must be published in nationwide circulation newspapers as well as in the Commercial Register Gazette. Within fifteen (15) days from the publication of a bankruptcy petition, other creditors may involve themselves in the proceedings, either by filing a claim for dismissal or acceptance of bankruptcy demand. If there is no objection filed, or objections that have been filed are dismissed, the commercial court will grant a depository injunction requiring the debt with accrued interest and expenses to be paid by the debtor within seven (7) days from the delivery of depository injunction to the debtor. If debtor pays or deposits such amount to the court, the bankruptcy case will be dismissed. If the debtor does not, the debtor will be declared bankrupt by the court and the creditor who petitioned for the bankruptcy must post security for costs and all notification expenses required for legal remedies of bankruptcy decision in the period up to the initial creditors meeting. After the deposit of this amount with the commercial court by the creditor, the court declares the debtor’s bankruptcy. This decision can be appealed within ten (10) days. For direct bankruptcy proceedings the same procedures apply as for ordinary proceedings, provided that the court may issue a bankruptcy decision without a depository injunction option. After the notification of the bankruptcy decision to the bankruptcy office, the bankruptcy office must send a notification to the relevant authorities about bankruptcy decision immediately.

Pledged assets of the debtor are included in bankruptcy estate but subject to the pledgee’s right of preference. _Effect of the Declaration of Bankruptcy upon a Debtor_ The main effect of bankruptcy proceedings on the debtor is that all unpaid debts of the debtor become due by the declaration of bankruptcy. Bankruptcy proceedings do not limit the debtor’s capacity to act. Debtors have the power of disposition on the assets which are not included in the bankruptcy estate. Although the debtor still remains the owner of assets included in the bankruptcy estate, it does not have the right to dispose of them. After the declaration of bankruptcy any disposition by the debtor of any asset in the bankruptcy estate is null and void. Since a bankruptcy proceeding is a full proceeding (külli takip) and all the creditors are treated equally, there is no need to have separate execution proceedings.

In the event of bankruptcy/insolvency, proceedings may be initiated in Turkey (Please note that in Turkish practice, the term “bankruptcy” may be used in preference to insolvency when dealing with corporate insolvency). The bankruptcy/insolvency laws of Turkey may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States, the United Kingdom or other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar. Please find below a general description of such laws. Bankruptcy proceedings under Turkish law are governed by the Turkish Execution and Bankruptcy Law No. 2004 (“Turkish Execution and Bankruptcy Law”). Along with the Turkish Execution and Bankruptcy Law, the Turkish Commercial Code also defines the conditions of insolvency and sets forth the rules for filing for bankruptcy. Insolvency can be defined as a debtor’s inability to cover its debts, while bankruptcy is a status to be determined by commercial courts, which announces the debtor’s inability to cover its debts by its assets. A company may be bankrupt under several circumstances. Insolvency is one of the grounds for bankruptcy. A company is deemed insolvent if its assets are not sufficient to cover its liabilities, or if the company is in financial difficulty in making timely payments of its debts. Any creditor may initiate a bankruptcy claim against a debtor which can be subject to the bankruptcy regime at the execution office in the district of the debtor (“Execution Office”). Upon application of the creditor, the execution officer sends a payment order to the debtor. If the debtor does not object to the payment order, it will become final and the creditor must bring a case before the competent commercial court for declaration of the debtor’s bankruptcy. If the debtor objects to the payment order within the term stipulated for each proceeding, bankruptcy proceedings will cease and the creditor must bring a claim to the commercial court for annulment of objection and declaration of debtor’s bankruptcy.",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

However, this Article 380 has not been tested in the Turkish courts and so it is possible that a Turkish court might decide that this guarantee falls within the provisions of Article 380 and is therefore void.

Accordingly, the affiliated company cannot be forced or directed to assume liabilities or debts such as taking over a business or assets, a transfer of debt, a transfer or reduction of profits, the creation of an encumbrance over its assets, the provision of surety and a guarantee or aval (guarantee of bills), unless the resulting loss is equalized and compensated within the relevant activity year or an equivalent right of claim is given to the affiliated company by the end of that operating year, stating when and how the loss will be equalized.

The address of the Company’s registered office is Rohrbachstraße 26-30, 85259 Wiedenzhausen, Germany. The consolidated interim financial statements of the Company as of and for the period ended September 30, 2014 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as “Wittur Group” or the “Group” and individually as “Group entities”). The parent company of Wittur International Holding GmbH is TriWay HoldCo AB, Stockholm. The ultimate controlling party is Way Luxco S.ar.l., Luxemburg. The entity owners or others do not have the power to amend the financial statements after issue. The Wittur Group is a leading independent solution provider for components, modules and complete elevators for the lift industry. It is a development partner and supplier to the major international lift companies, as well as small and medium-sized manufacturers. Its range of products comprises mainly the development and manufacture of doors, door mechanisms, cars, safety components, gearless drives, frames and complete elevators. The Wittur Group does not install lifts and does not offer maintenance services for lifts. 1.2 Basis of preparation These condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, ‘Interim financial reporting’. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013, which have been prepared in accordance and in conformity with all International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the publications of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) as adopted by the EU. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements were authorised for issue by the Executive Board of the Company on October 31, 2014. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have not been audited. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in Euros. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts are shown in thousands of Euros (KEUR) in accordance with the commercial rounding practices. For computational reasons, rounding differences of+/- one unit (€, %, etc.) can occur in the tables. 2 Significant accounting policies The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except where financial reporting standards have been applied for the first time in 2014. The following new standards and interpretations and amendments to existing standards became effective on January 1, 2014 and have been applied in preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements: - IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ - IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ - IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’ - IAS 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’ - IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ - IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’: Amendments for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities - IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’: Disclosures on the recoverable amount of impaired assets - IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’: Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting F-8 -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

On June 17, 2014 the EU adopted IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’. This interpretation was not applied in preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements. Taxes on income in the interim periods are accrued using the tax rate that would be applicable to expected total annual profit or loss. The exchange rates of certain significant currencies versus the Euro changed as follows: 3 Estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In preparing these consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in applying the group’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013. 4 Changes in the composition of the Group As of September 30, 2014, the Group’s consolidated financial statements included, besides Wittur International Holding GmbH, a total of 26 subsidiaries.

The main purpose of these financial liabilities is the financing of the Group’s business activities. Various financial assets such as trade receivables and cash which result directly from said business activities continue to be available to the Group. The Group is exposed to the following risks from financial instruments: - credit risk, - liquidity risk, and - market risk The condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements; they should be read in conjunction with the Group’s annual financial statements as at December 31, 2013.

At Wittur, the classification is based on the presentation on the balance sheet. 9 Additional disclosures on financial instruments (continued) 9 Additional disclosures on financial instruments (continued) The following tables provide the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Group’s non-current assets and liabilities. The different hierarchy levels have been defined as follows: Level 1 input are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date. A quoted market price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and is used without adjustment to measure fair value whenever available, with limited exceptions. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (‘market-corroborated inputs’). Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are used to measure fair value to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. An entity develops unobservable inputs using the best information available in the circumstances, which might include the entity’s own data, taking into account all information about market participant assumptions that is reasonably available. The Group’s policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of fair value hierarchy levels as at the end of the reporting period. There have been no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the interim period.

KEUR Dec. 31, 2012 Jan. 1, 2012 1 Corporate information (continued) 1.3 Explanation of transition to IFRS (continued) Intangible assets (continued) of the cash-generating units is performed at least annually. Transaction costs related to the acquisition have not been capitalized as part of the goodwill, instead are expensed under IFRS. Different treatments on goodwill resulted in an equity effect of KEUR 26,432 as of Dec. 31, 2012 (Jan. 01, 2012: KEUR 3,366) and an effect on the net result of KEUR 23,065 in 2012. Trade receivables and other receivables General allowances for doubtful accounts receivable recognised in the consolidated financial statements according to German GAAP are not permitted according to IFRS and have been released for accounting under IFRS. The explained effects increased receivables and equity by KEUR 171 as of Dec. 31, 2012 (Jan. 01, 2012: KEUR 171). Inventories The pure administrative surcharges in the consolidated financial statements according to German GAAP recognised as a markup percentage during the intercompany profit-elimination on group level have been eliminated for IFRS. This had an equity effect of KEUR -2,148 as of Dec. 31, 2012 (Jan. 01, 2012: KEUR -2,364) and impact on the net result of KEUR 216 in 2012. Non-controlling interests The minority interests at Wittur Group do classify as puttable instruments according to IFRS and have been reclassified from equity recognised under German GAAP to liabilities for the IFRS consolidated financial statements. The reclassification had an effect on equity of KEUR -550 as of Dec. 31, 2012 (Jan. 01, 2012: KEUR -580) and impact on net result of KEUR 30 of 2012. Interest-bearing loans and borrowings In the consolidated financial statements of Wittur Group according to German GAAP bank loans are recognised at their nominal amount. For IFRS the effective interest method according to IAS 39 is applied. Under this method a financial liability is recognised initially at fair value less transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the financial liabilities. Subsequently the liabilities are measured at amortised cost. The transaction costs are amortised as interest expense through profit and loss with an increase in the liability. The effective interest method leads to an effect on equity of KEUR 5,614 at Dec. 31, 2012 (Jan. 01, 2012: KEUR 7,272) and an effect of KEUR -1,658 on net result in 2012. Derivatives In order to limit the interest rate risk arising from loans that bear a variable interest rate Wittur Group entered into interest caps and swaps. Under IFRS the swaps and caps are measured at fair value through profit and loss. As of Jan. 01, 2012 the fair value of the caps and swap increases liabilities by KEUR 945 with and negative effect on equity, because no provision for the derivatives was recognised in the consolidated financial statement according to German GAAP. As of as Dec. 31, 2012 the derivatives were also recognised in the consolidated statements according to German GAAP and resulted in an impact on net result of KEUR 945. Provisions for pensions and other employee benefits For determinating the defined benefit obligations of the provisions for pensions and other employee benefits different discount rates under German GAAP and IFRS must been used. F-30 ----- 1 Corporate information (continued) 1.3 Explanation of transition to IFRS (continued) Provisions for pensions and other employee benefits (continued) Under IFRS actuarial gains and losses resulting from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions have been recognised directly in equity. The different treatments had an effect on equity of KEUR -1,907 as of Dec. 31, 2012 (Jan. 01, 2012: KEUR -308) and an impact of KEUR 325 on net result and of KEUR -1,535 on comprehensive income in 2012. Finance lease Under IFRS, some leases with the Group as lessee are classified as finance leases which were treated as operating leases under German GAAP. For IFRS those leased assets have been capitalised and a lease liability is recognised. The lease expenses recognised under German GAAP are reversed for IFRS and allocated to the repayment of the lease liability und an interest portion. This had an inpact on equity of KEUR 187 as of Dec. 31, 2012 (Jan. 1, 2012: KEUR 135) and an effect on net result from the depreciation of leased assets and interest expenses amounting KEUR 52 in 2012. Deferred taxes The adjustments as described above resulted in additional differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements and their tax basis. Deferred taxes were recognised on temporary differences. This resulted on a positive impact on equity of KEUR 4,117 as of Dec. 31, 2012 and KEUR 2,153 as of Jan. 1, 2012 and a positive effect on net result of KEUR 1,845 in 2012. Current taxes In HGB 2012 a current taxes adjustment was reversed in P&L as no longer required, however this was adjusted in equity within the IFRS opening balance sheet, therefore impacting IFRS net result of KEUR-347 in 2012. Exchange differences on translation of foreign operations According to IFRS exchange differences on translation of foreign operations are recognised in the other comprehensive income amounting KEUR - 556 as of Dec. 31, 2012. Consolidated statement of cash flows Differences between HGB and IFRS in the consolidated statement of cash flows mainly arise from the allocation of cash in- and outflow to operating, investing and financing activities. 1.4 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statement comprises the statement of Wittur International Holding GmbH and its subsidiaries as at December 31, 2013. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that currently are exercisable are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group. Internal Group profit and loss, expenses and revenues as well as receivables and liabilities between consolidated companies are eliminated. 1.5 Consolidated companies The Group’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2013 include, besides Wittur International Holding GmbH, a total of 28 subsidiaries. In 2013 two companies were merged and one company was sold. For F-31 ----- 1 Corporate information (continued) 1.5 Consolidated companies (continued) the disposal we refer to Note 5.8. As of December 31, 2012 the Group had non-controlling interests, however due to materiality does not present it separately. As of December 31, 2013 the following companies were consolidated: Shareholding in % Dec. 31, 2012 Shareholding in % Jan. 1, 2012 Wittur Group companies 2 Estimates and judgements 2.1 General provisions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. The assumptions and estimates principally relate to the consolidation of business combinations, the assessment of the recoverability of the carrying amount of intangible assets (in particular goodwill), the group-wide determination of useful lives of material assets, taxation and the recognition of deferred tax assets and the measurement and recognition of provisions for pensions and other provisions. Assumptions and estimates are based on premises derived from knowledge at the time. Within the scope of business combinations, general estimates are also made when determining the fair values of the assets acquired. In principle fair value is determined based on the prognosis of future cash flow. 2.2 Economic useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets The applied economic lives of non-current assets are based on estimates of the management. The Group reviews the estimated economic useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at the end of every financial year. 2.3 Taxation The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to routine tax audits and also a process whereby tax computations are discussed and agreed with the respective authorities. Whilst the ultimate outcome of such tax audits and discussions cannot be determined with certainty, management estimates the level of provisions required for both current and deferred tax on the basis of professional advice and the nature of current discussions with the tax authority concerned. 2.4 Estimates and assumptions The key assumptions concerning the future economic situation and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. Impairment of non-financial assets The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting date. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and at other times when such indicators exist. Other non-financial assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Deferred tax assets Management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future tax planning strategies. For further details refer to note 5.8 Income taxes. Fair value of financial instruments The Group measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives, and non-financial assets such as investment properties, at fair value at each balance sheet date. Also, fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in Note 7 Additional disclosures on financial instruments. F-33 ----- 2 Estimates and judgements (continued) 2.4 Estimates and assumptions (continued) Fair value of financial instruments (continued) The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. The fair values of the derivatives are presented in the balance sheet on a gross basis. Pension and other post-employment benefits The carrying amount of defined benefit pensions plans and other post-employment benefits are based on actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuations involved making assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. The net pension liability at December 31, 2013 is KEUR 8,785 (2012: KEUR 9,597). Further details are given in note 5.22 Provisions for pensions. Other provisions Such provisions are recognised when it is considered probable that economical, legal, ecological and decommissioning obligations will result in future outflows of economic benefits, when the costs can be estimated reliably and the measures in question are not expected to result in future inflows of economic benefits. The estimate of future costs is subject to many uncertainties, including legal uncertainties based on the applicable laws and regulations and with uncertainties regarding to the actual conditions in the different countries and operating locations. In particular, estimates of costs are based on earlier experiences in similar cases, the conclusions of expert opinions commissioned by the Group, current costs and new developments that have a bearing on the costs. Any changes to these estimates could have an impact on the future results of the Group. At December 31, 2013, the carrying amount of recognised other provisions were KEUR 8,191 (2012: KEUR 7,358). 3 Significant accounting policies The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently by all Group entities. 3.1 New accounting standards and interpretations Wittur Group applied all effective standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and the IFRIC for preparation of the consolidated financial statements if their application was required as of December 31, 2013. F-34 ----- 3 Significant accounting policies (continued) 3.1 New accounting standards and interpretations (continued) The following standards and interpretations have been issued by the IASB prior to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and must be adopted for reporting periods starting January 1, 2014 or at a later date. Wittur Group will adopt them at their mandatory effective date and has analyzed the effects caused by the implementation. 3 Significant accounting policies (continued) 3.1 New accounting standards and interpretations (continued) joint operations. Proportionate consolidation for joint ventures will no longer be permissible as a result of the discontinuation of IAS 31. Amended IAS 28 “Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures” will now govern the application of the equity method when accounting for investments in both associates and joint ventures. In case of a joint operation, the share of assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues is directly recognised in the consolidated financial statements and annual financial statements of the joint operator. Based on the current structure of Wittur Group and its economic relations there are no changes expected that will affect the results of operations, financial positions or cash flows. IFRS 12 “Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities” will prescribe the information to be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements about interests in subsidiaries, associates, joint arrangements and non-consolidated structured entities. The objective of these disclosures is to enable the users of an entity’s financial statements to understand the nature of its interests in other entities, the risks associated with them, and the effects of the interests on its financial position and results of operations. Wittur Group does not expect major changes in presentation of the results of operations, financial positions or cash flows caused by the implementation. IAS 27 “Separate Financial Statements” was renamed and adapted together with the enacting of IFRS 10 and will now exclusively govern the accounting for subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in their separate annual financial statements and the corresponding notes. Wittur Group does not expect effects on the results of operations, financial positions or cash flows caused by the implementation. IAS 28 “Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures” was renamed and adapted together with the enacting of IFRS 11. IAS 28 will govern the accounting of investments in associates and joint ventures which are in the scope of IFRS 11 using the equity method. Wittur Group does not expect effects on the results of operations, financial positions or cash flows caused by the implementation. IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation” was amended to specify the requirements for offsetting financial instruments. To meet the new offsetting requirements in IAS 32, an entity’s right to set off must not be contingent on a future event and must be enforceable both in the normal course of business and in the event of default or insolvency of the entity and all counterparties. It is further specified that a gross settlement mechanism also complies with the offsetting requirements according to IAS 32, provided no major credit liquidity risks remain, and receivables and payables are processed in a single settlement step, making it equivalent to a net settlement. Wittur Group does not expect major changes in the results of operations, financial position or cash flows caused by the implementation. IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” was amended to modify the disclosures on recoverable amounts of impaired assets. The disclosures were initially amended as a consequence of the release of IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement” and now clarify that the disclosure of information about the recoverable amount of impaired assets is limited to the recoverable amount of impaired assets that is based on fair value less costs of disposal. Wittur Group does not expect major changes in the results of operations, financial position or cash flows caused by the implementation. IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” was amended to allow hedge accounting to continue in a situation where a derivative, which has been designated as a hedging instrument, is novated to effect clearing with a central counterparty as a result of laws or regulation, if specific conditions are met. F-36 ----- 3 Significant accounting policies (continued) 3.1 New accounting standards and interpretations (continued) The accounting and presentation of the derivatives hold at Wittur Group are not affected by the amended Standard. Wittur Group therefore does not expect changes in the results of operations, financial position or cash flows. IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” will govern the classification and measurement of financial assets and will replace IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”. IFRS 9 defines two instead of four measurement categories (IAS 39) for financial assets, with classification to be based partly on the company’s business model and partly on the characteristics of the contractual cash flows from the respective financial asset. In the case of equity investments that are not held for trading, an entity may choose at initial recognition to recognize future changes in their fair value in other comprehensive income. The disclosure requirements under IFRS 7 concerning the first-time application of IFRS 9 were amended at the same time. Wittur Group does not expect major changes in results of operations, financial position or cash flows caused by the implementation of the new standard. IFRIC Interpretation 21 “Levies” will clarify how an entity should account for liabilities to pay levies imposed by governments, other than income taxes, in its financial statements. The discussed question is when the entity should recognize a liability to pay a levy. IFRIC 21 is an interpretation of IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”. IAS 37 sets out criteria for the recognition of a liability, one of which is the requirement for the entity to have a present obligation as a result of a past event (obligating event). The interpretation now clarifies that the obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity described in the relevant legislation that triggers the payment of the levy. Wittur Group does not expect changes in results of operations, financial position or cash flows caused by the implementation of the interpretation. 3.2 Foreign currencies The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in euros (KEUR), which is also the parent company’s functional currency. For each entity the Group determines the functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. The Group uses the direct method of consolidation and has elected to recycle the gain or loss that arises from this method. Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group entities at their respective functional currency spot rate at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency spot rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss with the exception of monetary items that are designated as part of the hedge of the Group’s net investment of a foreign operation. These are recognised in other comprehensive income until the net investment is disposed of, at which time, the cumulative amount is classified to profit or loss. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those monetary items are also recorded in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of gain or loss on change in fair value in the item (i.e., the translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss, respectively). Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation subsequent to 1 January 2012 and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate. F-37 ----- 3 Significant accounting policies (continued) 3.2 Foreign currencies (continued) Transactions and balances (continued) Prior to 1 January 2012, the date of transition to IFRS, the Group treated goodwill and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition as assets and liabilities of the parent. Therefore, those assets and liabilities are non-monetary items already expressed in the functional currency of the parent and no further translation differences occur. Group companies The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into euros at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their income statements are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The exchange differences arising on the translation are recognised in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of other comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement. The exchange rates of certain significant currencies versus the Euro changed as follows: 3 Significant accounting policies (continued) 3.4 Intangible assets (continued) Purchased intangible assets (continued) Scheduled amortisation of intangible assets may take place over the following useful life period: 3 Significant accounting policies (continued) 3.5 Property, plant and equipment (continued) The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows: 3 Significant accounting policies (continued) 3.8 Investment Properties (continued) Investment properties are derecognised either when they have been disposed of or when they are permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from their disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in the income statement in the period of derecognition. The estimated useful live for the current and comparative periods is as follows: 3 Significant accounting policies (continued) 3.10 Income taxes (continued) A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 3.11 Financial instruments Financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets, loans and borrowings, trade and other payables as well as other financial liabilities. _Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits._ Financial assets are recognised initially at fair value and, for instruments not at fair value through profit or loss, any directly attributable transaction costs. Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date – the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Subsequent measurement depends on the categorisation of the financial instrument as described below: _Loans and receivables comprise trade receivables and other financial assets and are measured at amortised cost_ less any impairment losses. Impairment losses on trade receivables are recognised using separate allowance accounts. Amounts charged to the allowance account are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash. _Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss: An instrument is classified at fair value through profit_ or loss, if it is held for trading or is designated as such upon initial recognition. Financial instruments are designated at fair value through profit or loss if the Group manages such investments and makes purchase and sale decisions based on their fair value in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or investment strategy. Upon initial recognition attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss when incurred. Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognised in profit or loss. The Group does not apply the fair value option but has derivatives which fall into the sub-category held for trading. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are measured at fair value on initial recognition. For all financial liabilities not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss, the transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are also recognised. Trade payables and other financial liabilities are generally measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is shown in the Group’s balance sheet only if, at the relevant balance sheet date, there is a legitimate claim to offset the amounts accounted for against each other and if it is intended that a settlement be made on a net basis or that the liability in question be extinguished at the same time by realising the asset concerned. 3.12 Financial income and expenses Financial income comprises interest income on funds invested and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest method. Financial expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions, changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments, impairment losses recognised on financial assets. All borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. F-42 ----- 3 Significant accounting policies (continued) 3.13 Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. An impairment exists if one or more events that has occurred since the initial recognition of the asset (an incurred ‘loss event’), has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. Objective evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation and observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults. 3.14 Provisions for pensions and other employee benefits Pensions for provisions and other employee benefits are carried as liabilities in accordance with IAS 19.67 using the projected unit credit method. The Group accounts for actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive income. The same applies to past service costs. The amount which has to be accounted for as a liability from a defined-benefit pension plan comprises of the cash value of the defined-benefit pension obligation less the fair value of the plan assets which exist for the direct fulfilment of obligations. Actuarial valuations for the obligations are drawn up annually on the balance sheet date. An actuarial valuation is made on the basis of various assumptions. These include the calculation of the discount rates for unaccrued interest, future wage and salary increases, the mortality rate and future pension increases. Because the valuation and the assumptions on which it is based are complex and long-term, a performance-related obligation reacts very sensitively indeed to any change in said assumptions. All assumptions are thus reviewed on each annual financial statement date. 3.15 Other provisions A provision is recognised, if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of discounting is material, provisions are measured at their present value. The amount assumed to flow out in the subsequent year is recognised as current portion of the provision. 3.16 Leases Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. Rental and lease payments made by the Group under operating leases are recognised in other operating expenses as they incur. 3.17 Government grants Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income on a systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. When the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as income in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset. When the Group receives grants of non-monetary assets, the asset and the grant are recorded at nominal amounts and released to profit or loss over the expected useful life in a pattern of consumption of the benefit of the underlying asset by equal annual instalments. When loans or similar assistance are provided by governments or related institutions, with an interest rate below the current applicable market rate, the effect of this favourable interest is regarded as a government grant. F-43 ----- 4 Financial risk management The financial liabilities used by the Company mainly comprise bank loans and overdrafts, finance leases, debts from supply and performance and hire purchase contracts and other loans granted. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is the financing of the Group’s business activities. Various financial assets such as trade receivables and cash which result directly from said business activities continue to be available to the Group. The Group is exposed to the following risks from financial instruments: - credit risk, - liquidity risk, and - market risk This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the Group’s management of capital. The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. 4.1 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group, if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is mainly influenced by the individual characteristics of each customer. The Group only concludes business transactions with creditworthy third parties. All customers wishing to conclude business transactions with the Group on credit are subjected to a test of their creditworthiness. In addition to that, the receivables are monitored continuously, so that the Group is not exposed to any substantial risks of nonpayment. In the case of transactions which are not carried out in the country of the operative unit concerned no credits are granted without prior approval from the head of accounts receivable controlling. There are no substantial concentrations of non-payment risks in the Group. The Group does not see a credit risk for financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired. 4.2 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due, e.g. settlement of its financial debt and paying its suppliers. The Group’s approach of managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group continuously monitors the risk of a liquidity bottleneck using a liquidity planning tool. It is the aim of the Group to maintain a balance between ongoing coverage of the need for funds and the guarantee of flexibility by the use of overdrafts, loans, finance leases and hire purchase contracts. Beyond effective working capital and cash management, the Group mitigates liquidity risk by having undrawn credit facilities. F-44 ----- 4 Financial risk management (continued) 4.2 Liquidity risk (continued) Future cash outflows arising from financial liabilities that are recognised and unrecognised in the consolidated balance sheet are presented in the following table. This includes payments to settle the liabilities and interest payments. Financial liabilities that are repayable on demand are included on the basis of the earliest date of repayment. Cash flows for instruments with a variable interest rate are determined with reference to the market conditions at the balance sheet date.

Management is in process to analyse the underlying risks and to implement adequate instruments to mitigate these risks. Foreign currency risks the Group is exposed to result from its operating activities. Although Group entities mainly operate in their individual functional currency, some Group entities are exposed to foreign currency risks based on planned payments in a currency other than their functional currency. Foreign currency risks are presented by application of sensitivity analyses required by IFRS 7. These show the effects of hypothetical changes of relevant risk variables on result before tax as a consequence of upward revaluation and devaluation of EUR against CNY and EUR against TRY which are material for the group. All other currencies are not material. In the scope of these analyses are financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency and being of a monetary nature. According to the requirements of IFRS 7 differences resulting from the translation of financial statements into the Group’s presentation currency are not taken into consideration. No effects, except for those from result before tax, resulted on shareholders’ equity. As hedge accounting is not applied, there are no effects on other comprehensive income. KEUR **2013** 2012 4 Financial risk management (continued) 4.3 Market risk (continued) Interest rate risk (continued) Changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of non-derivative variable-interest financial instruments and the interest payments which are not designated as hedged items of cash flow hedges against interest rate risks. As a consequence, they are included in the calculation of income-related sensitivities.

Country-specific tax rates were used in each case to calculate deferred taxes. The following table reconciles the expected income tax expense to the actual income tax expense presented in the consolidated financial statements. The effective tax expense results from the application of an income tax rate of 26.3% (2012: 26.3%) to consolidate profit for the period (before taxes) in accordance with IFRS. The income tax rate is made up of corporation tax at 15% (2012: 15%), a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% (2012: 5.5%) and trade tax at 10.5% (2012: 10.5%). The tax rate applied is the German tax rate.

The deferred tax assets amounting to KEUR 5,120 (2012: KEUR 5,615) have been recognised in respect of these losses. The Group did not recognise income tax assets in respect of losses amounting to KEUR 4,578 (2012: KEUR 2,765). Losses amounting to KEUR 171 (2012: nil) expire in 2014. Apart from tax loss carry forwards, no deferred tax assets on interest carry forwards amounting to KEUR 25,394 (2012: KEUR 16,739) were recognised in Germany as it is not probable that these interest carry forwards can be utilised. 5.9 Discontinued operations September 2012, the Board decided to divest the shares of Wittur Hydraulic Drives s.r.l., Bagnatica, Italy.

Wittur initially received two term facilities (A, B) with a nominal amount of KEUR 72,500 each at December 22, 2010. The maturity of facility A is December 6, 2016; the maturity of facility B is December 6, 2017. At September 5, 2013 the Senior Facility Agreement was amended. Wittur received a term facility (C) with a nominal amount of KEUR 60,000 at the reporting date. The maturity of facility C is December 7, 2018. The repayment of facility C is done at the termination date. The facility loans are bearing a variable interest rate based on the 1 month- EURIBOR interest rate plus a margin rate. The effective interest rates are in the range of 3.23% to 4.48% (2012: 3.11% to 4.36%). The amount of borrowing costs capitalized during the year 2013 for facility (C) was KEUR 2,878. Together with the term loan facilities an additional revolving credit facility including ancillary facilities of KEUR 30,000 max. was granted. The total revolving credit facility is split in an initial revolving credit facility and ancillary facilities. These credit and ancillary facilities are concluded with different banks. The revolving credit facilities are bearing a variable interest rate. The interest rate is based on an interest reference rate plus a margin. The Senior Facility Agreement contains financial covenants as leverage cover, interest cover, CAPEX limitation and cash flow cover. Wittur is in compliance with all these covenants. The following collateral was provided under the above mentioned Senior Facility Agreement: - Pledging of bank accounts (2013: KEUR 19,998, 2012: KEUR 22,372) - General assignments concerning all receivables, including insurance benefits (2013: KEUR 85,179, 2012: KEUR 77,924) - Mortgages (KEUR 46,000 in 2013 and 2012) - Assignments of assets (2013: KEUR 378,832, 2012: KEUR 389,538) Given the positive economic situation in key markets, the position of the individual Group companies in the respective markets and positive results of operations, it is currently not expected that the collateral will be utilized.

Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. Development expenditure is capitalized only if development costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. When the excess is negative (badwill) it is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Capitalized goodwill is not subject to amortisation. It is assessed annually for impairment and can be assessed more frequently, if there might be any indication for impairment during the year. 3.5 Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use and the costs of dismantling and removing the items. If parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised net within other operating income or other operating expenses in profit or loss. The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item, if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. Depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Leased assets under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.

All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. 3.7 Impairment of intangible assets and of property, plant and equipment The carrying amounts of the Group’s intangible assets and items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill the recoverable amount is estimated at least once in a year at the same time. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of the attributable fair value less the costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the difference is recognised as an impairment loss in the income statement. For the impairment test, assets are reflected at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If the cash flow for an asset is not separately identifiable, the impairment test is conducted on the basis of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. Goodwill is allocated to CGU’s to perform an annual impairment test on goodwill. The allocation is made to those CGU’s or groups of CGU’s that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose identified according to operating segment. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGUs and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed even in case of subsequent increase in value. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed, if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. 3.8 Investment Properties IAS 16 and IAS 40 permit investment properties to be carried at historical cost less provisions for depreciation and impairment. F-40 ----- Investment properties 25 3.9 Inventories Inventories include raw materials and supplies, work in progress, semi-finished goods, finished goods and merchandise. Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realisable value. The cost of inventories includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost of inventories includes direct material and production costs and an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. 3.10 Income taxes Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.

Wittur aims to manage its capital in a way that supports the profitable growth of operations by securing an adequate liquidity and capitalization of the group at all times ensuring the ability to meet the financial obligations. In order to achieve this overall objective, the Group’s capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans and borrowings that define capital structure requirements. Breaches in meeting the financial covenants would permit the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings. There have been no breaches in the financial covenants of any interest-bearing loans and borrowing in the current period. The Group considers both capital and net debt as relevant components of funding, hence, part of its capital management. The Group manages the equity as capital under IFRS amounting to KEUR -1,702 (2012: KEUR -4,893). The Group includes within net debt: interest bearing loans and borrowings from banks and finance leases; less cash and short-term deposits, excluding discontinued operations. The assets employed in Wittur’s business consist principally of net working capital, fixed assets, and investments which are funded by equity and net debt. Cash flow from operations is the principal source of Wittur’s financing. External funding, as well as cash and cash equivalents, are managed centrally by the Group Treasury according to the Group Treasury Policy. Liquid assets are invested only in counterparties with high creditworthiness and deposits to ensure continuous access to the funds. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012. No Group companies were subject to minimum capital requirements requested by external parties. F-58 -----",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

The fair values of non-current financial instruments are calculated as the present values of the estimated future cash flows using market interest rates for discounting. The fair values of non-current financial liabilities with variable interest rates are estimated to be equal to their carrying amounts since the interest rates agreed and those available on the market do not significantly differ. The following table provides the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Group’s non-current assets and liabilities. The different hierarchy levels have been defined as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date. A quoted market price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and is used without adjustment to measure fair value whenever available, with limited exceptions. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (‘market-corroborated inputs’). Level 3 inputs inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are used to measure fair value to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. An entity develops unobservable inputs using the best information available in the circumstances, which might include the entity’s own data, taking into account all information about market participant assumptions that is reasonably available. The Group’s policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of fair value hierarchy levels as at the end of the reporting period. There have been no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during 2012 and 2013.

If and to the extent that a manager ceases his employment before the occurrence of an exit event (so-called leaver event), the executive manager grants the General Partner of the Partnership the right to purchase and acquire all of his shares (leaver shares). The purchase price for the leaver shares will be determined, depending on the reasons for and time of leaving, as the higher or lower of the fair market value of the leaver shares or the cost of investment plus interest on these equity instruments. As the reporting entity has no obligation to settle the entitlements at any time (neither in case of an exit nor in case of a leaver event), the award is accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transaction according to IFRS 2.

Differences arising from valuation allowances for and discounting of Group receivables, from differences in the measurement of receivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies (lower/higher of cost or market principle respecting amounts denominated in foreign currency with residual terms of more than one year), and from provisions for intra-Group risks have been offset in profit and loss. Contingent liabilities are eliminated in the same way. Consolidation Measures in the Income Statement Sales revenues and other revenues from the supplying of goods and services between the companies included in the consolidated financial statements are offset in the consolidated income statement against the respective expenses attributable to them. Elimination of intra-Group Results Intra-Group results from the sale of tangible assets within the Group are eliminated in case of materiality. Inventories from supplies provided by consolidated Group companies that are to be included in the consolidated financial statements are stated at their intra-Group acquisition or manufacturing costs. The intra-Group results arising in this context are eliminated. Currency Translation In accordance with Section 308a HGB, the modified closing rate method is used for foreign currency translation of the individual local financial statements denominated in foreign currency. In this context, the asset and F-83 ----- liability items stated in a consolidated subsidiary’s balance sheet denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the spot exchange middle rate applicable as of the balance sheet date, except for shareholders’ equity, which is translated into euros using historical rates. The items stated in the income statement are translated into euros using average rates. Any translation differences are reported under consolidated shareholders’ equity as shareholders’ capital difference from currency translation. Period Allocation of Deferred Taxes The tax deferrals recorded in the consolidated financial statements for deferred taxes concern temporary differences that are expected to reverse in future financial years. They result from the commercial valuation of assets, liabilities and deferred items and their tax-based valuation in the individual balance sheets of the consolidated companies pursuant to Section 274 HGB and from adjusting the individual local financial statements included in the consolidated financial statements to the Group’s uniform accounting and valuation, and from consolidation in the consolidated balance sheet pursuant to Section 306 HGB. The valid tax rates applicable in the respective countries are used for determining the tax deferrals. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not netted. Deferred items pursuant to Sections 274 and 306 HGB are combined in accordance with Section 306 Clause 6 HGB. C. Accounting and Valuation Principles Accounting and valuation is based on the provisions stipulated in the German Commercial Code (HGB) respecting large corporations and on the uniform accounting and valuation principles of the Parent Company. The realization and imparity principles are being observed; assets are stated no higher than their acquisition or manufacturing costs. It is only with respect to receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies which have a residual term of up to one year that the acquisition costs and the realization principle pursuant to Section 256 a Clause 2 HGB are not observed. Acquired intangible assets are stated at cost and, to the extent depreciable, are amortized over their expected useful lives net of scheduled amortization or are written down to the expected permanent lower fair value. The Company makes use of the option provided for under Section 248 (2) HGB to capitalize internally generated intangible assets. The internally generated intangible assets are reported at manufacturing cost and are amortized over the anticipated useful life net of scheduled amortization or written down to the expected permanent lower fair value. Total research and development costs are shown in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under Section D.I.2. Tangible assets are stated at acquisition or manufacturing costs and, to the extent depreciable, are depreciated net of scheduled depreciation or are written down to the expected permanent lower fair value. Financial assets are reported at acquisition cost or at the permanent lower fair value. The tangible assets are depreciated over their expected useful lives on a straight-line basis or are written down to the expected permanent lower fair value. As a general rule, additions to property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a prorated basis. Low value items of up to EUR 410.00 are fully written down in the year of addition. Raw materials and supplies are stated at cost or the lower fair value; the lower fair values are mainly determined on the basis of the conditions prevailing in the procurement market, while also accounting for the possible use of the inventories. F-84 ----- Write-downs for inventory risks resulting from the period of storage and reduced recoverability are recorded to an adequate and sufficient extent. Finished goods and work in progress are stated at manufacturing costs. The manufacturing costs comprise production materials, direct labor costs, cost of materials, manufacturing overhead costs as well as appropriate, proportionate administrative overheads. Sufficient write-downs that were updated in this financial year were recorded with regard to slow moving and technically outdated goods. The goods were measured without loss in accordance with the conditions prevailing in the sales market. Merchandise is reported at cost or the lower market prices. Receivables and other assets are stated at nominal value. Adequate individual value adjustments have been recorded for all items that are subject to risk; general valuation allowances that were updated in this financial year were set up to account for the general credit risk. Bank balances are recognized at nominal value or the lower fair value. Prepaid expenses include payments made for circumstances that will first be reported as expenses in the following years. The projected unit credit method was used for the valuation of pension provisions. The expected wage and salary trends for Germany stand at 0%, since only one person that is retired is concerned in this context. The assumptions listed in the following Table served as the basis of calculation: and which represent plan assets within the meaning of Section 246 (2) Clause 2 HGB. In accordance with a confirmation, the netted present value of the plan assets amounts to EUR 2,690,715.86 as of December 31, 2012 (2011: KEUR 2,218). The acquisition costs of the plan asset stood at EUR 2,690,715.86 as of December 31, 2012 (2011: KEUR 2,218). Accordingly, the respective settlement amount corresponded to the plan assets’ present value. The netted expenses and income amounted to EUR 69,943.05 in financial year 2012 (2011: KEUR 52). Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are used at Wittur to limit risks from changes in interest rates. Since no valuation unit has been formed for these derivative financial instruments, the reporting is done on the basis of the imparity principle, which means that provisions are created for negative market values; while positive market values are not reported. For acquired options, the entire option premium is capitalized as an asset and is subject to the strict lower of price or market value principle for reporting on the balance sheet date. A liability is recognized for still outstanding option premiums. The market value is calculated on the basis of the market data applicable on the balance sheet date with the aid of the recognized option price models (for interest options) and by discounting anticipated future cash flows over the remaining term (for interest rate swaps). D. Notes and Disclosures on the Consolidated Financial Statements I. Consolidated Balance Sheet 1. Fixed Assets The development of the Group’s fixed assets is presented in the schedule of fixed assets found in these notes to the consolidated financial statements.

F-86 ----- 3. Receivables and Other Assets The asset value of the Employers’ Pension Liability Insurance in the amount of KEUR 2,691 (2011: KEUR 2,218), which was netted with the liabilities arising from deferred compensation, has a term of more than one year as of December 31, 2012. In total, there are receivables in the amount of KEUR 7,291 which have a residual term of more than one year as of December 31, 2012 (2011: KEUR 6,991). 4. Provisions The provisions item is structured as follows: 2012** 2011 KEUR** KEUR Pension provisions **1,242** 1,253 Severance payment provisions **6,887** 6,289 Tax provisions **4,544** 6,609 Other provisions **23,072** 17,078 Total provisions **35,745** 31,229 Other provisions are mainly comprised of provisions for vacations, other personnel- related provisions and provisions for warranty commitments. 5. Deferred Taxes The consolidated financial statements contain deferred taxes that are attributable to temporary differences between the commercial and the tax accounts (2011: deferred tax assets in the amount of KEUR 5,088 and deferred tax liabilities amounting to KEUR 25,716). They are composed of the following: Deferred Deferred tax tax assets liabilities KEUR KEUR - Individual local financial statements included in the consolidated financial statements (HB I) 3,342 335 - Adjustments to the Group’s uniform accounting and valuation (HB II) 4,929 21,169 Total 8,264 21,504 The significant temporary differences between the commercial and the tax balance sheet that result in deferred tax assets concern provisions and value adjustments in Turkey that need not be taken into account for tax purposes and severance payment provisions at Wittur GmbH in Austria that are not tax-deductible. The significant deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2012 are due to the disclosure of hidden reserves during the initial consolidation, which accounts for deferred tax liabilities in the amount of EUR 19.0 million, and to differences in the depreciation/amortization regulations concerning commercial law and tax law. The hidden reserves, in turn, are comprised of the revaluation of tangible assets and inventories, the valuation of the customer base and brand rights, and, to a smaller extent, of the knowledge on the technologies employed. In total, carry-over losses of KEUR 27,491 (2011: KEUR 20,109) were classified as not recoverable and therefore not reported as deferred tax assets. The local tax rates used for the calculation of the deferred taxes are between 10% and 35%. F-87 ----- 6. Liabilities",N/A,as_expected,2015,442

Other provisions take into account all recognizable risks and uncertain liabilities as well as anticipated losses from pending transactions. The provisions were stated at the settlement amounts – including price and cost increases – required by sound business judgment to meet future payment obligations.
