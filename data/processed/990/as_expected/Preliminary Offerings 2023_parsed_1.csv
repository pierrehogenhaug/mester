990_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,2654,BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND OTHER INFORMATION,2654.1,,2654.1.1,,"The Issuer was formerly known as Central Parent Inc. The Issuer converted to a limited liability company, known as Central Parent LLC, on April 26, 2023 as part of a restructuring plan. Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition on July 6, 2022, the Issuer had no operations and did not have material assets. On July 6, 2022, Central Merger Sub, Inc., a subsidiary of the Issuer, completed the Acquisition and was merged into CDK, with CDK surviving and remaining a subsidiary of Parent. The Issuer was determined to be the surviving accounting acquirer of CDK. CDK was formerly known as CDK Global, Inc. CDK converted to a limited liability company, known as CDK Global II LLC, on April 26, 2023 as part of the aforementioned restructuring plan. The Corporate Co-Issuer was formed on May 1, 2023 and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the LLC Co-Issuer that exists solely for the purpose of serving as a co-issuer of the Company’s senior notes, including the notes offered hereby. CDK’s fiscal years for the historical periods presented in this offering memorandum, namely “fiscal year 2020,” “fiscal year 2021” and “fiscal year 2022,” are the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Concurrent with the consummation of the Acquisition on July 6, 2022, CDK changed its fiscal year from the period beginning on July 1 and ending on June 30 to the period beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31 of each year, effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2023, to align with the fiscal year of the Issuer. The sixmonth period from July 1 to December 31, 2022 served as a transition period and is included in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. We did not adjust operating results for prior periods. Financial and operating data for such transition period represents consolidated Predecessor (as defined herein) results for the period from July 1 to July 5, 2022 and consolidated Successor results for the period from July 6, 2022 to December 31, 2022. These combined results for the six months ended December 31, 2022 are not considered to be prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and have not been prepared as pro forma results under applicable regulations. The audited consolidated financial statements for the 5-day period ended July 5, 2022 and for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2022 included elsewhere in this offering memorandum are referred to therein and herein as “Predecessor” consolidated financial information and reflect only the results of CDK prior to the consummation of the Acquisition. The consolidated statement of operations data and consolidated balance sheet data subsequent to July 5, 2022 are referred to in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum and herein as “Successor” consolidated financial information. In this offering memorandum, “financial statements” refer to the Predecessor consolidated financial statements and the Successor consolidated financial statements for the respective periods presented. Predecessor and Successor financial information presented herein is not comparable primarily due to the fact that the Successor financial information reflects: - the application of acquisition accounting as of July 6, 2022, as further described in Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, which requires the Company to reflect the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination as of the date of acquisition which often exceeds the net assets’ carrying value on the acquired business’s financial statements. As a result of applying acquisition accounting, the carrying value of Successor net assets exceeds the carrying value of Predecessor net assets on the consolidated statement of financial position. The most significant implication to the consolidated statements of operations for Successor periods due to the application of acquisition accounting is increased amortization expense; and ----- - additional debt and interest expense associated with debt financing arrangements entered into in connection with the Acquisition, as further described in Note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. In addition, financial and operating data for the last twelve months ended March 31, 2023 represents consolidated Predecessor results for the period from April 1 to July 5, 2022 and consolidated Successor results for the period from July 6, 2022 to March 31, 2023. The combined results set forth herein for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, for the six and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, and for the last twelve months ended March 31, 2023, in each case are not considered to be prepared in accordance with GAAP and have not been prepared as pro forma results under applicable regulations. We do not as a matter of course make public projections as to future revenues, net income or other results.

Our flagship DMS software solutions are hosted ERP applications tailored to the unique requirements of the dealer. Dealers use this software solution to manage critical business processes, including most revenue producing activities as well as the system of record for accounting and OEM reporting. With multi-location management ability, dealers receive real-time data with actionable insights to deliver immediate business improvements. Our DMS products facilitate the sale of new and used vehicles, consumer financing, repair and maintenance services, and vehicle and parts inventory management. We believe our offerings are mission critical for dealers, but we estimate that they typically represent only 2% to 4% of the annual operating expenses of running a dealership. Complementary to our core DMS, we also provide a portfolio of layered software applications and services to address the unique needs of automotive retail workflows. In recent years, we have strategically focused on delivering solutions that solve key pain points for our customers and simplifying their software vendors onto one fully integrated software platform. This includes consolidating technology vendors within a dealer location and removing friction from the vehicle-buying experience. Specifically, we digitized critical pieces of the sales process with products such as ELEAD1ONE (“ELEAD”) customer relationship management (“CRM”), Digital Contracting and eSign. Our Roadster and digital retailing offering provide capabilities to enable dealers to sell new and used vehicles completely online, while also giving consumers the option to begin and end the vehicle-buying process anywhere they choose – online or in-store. These solutions are often integrated into and targeted at users of our DMSs, but may, in some cases, be provided to customers that do not otherwise use our DMS. CDK’s software is the system of record for its customers. For both automotive retailers and OEMs, we provide data management and business intelligence solutions through our open Neuron intelligent data platform that extract, cleanse, normalize, enhance, and distribute billions of pieces of industry information and turn it into usable data that provides actionable insights and products. We also offer automotive retailers and OEMs a variety of professional services, custom programming, consulting, IT solutions, implementation and training solutions, as well as a full range of customer support solutions. 2 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

In order to reduce complexity and enable end-to-end automotive commerce, our strategy is to provide an integrated software product with an open technology platform that can deliver seamless, workflow-driven solutions for our customers. We believe we are leaders in this industry because our product provides this seamless integration of multiple workflows and we will continue to invest in this product to ensure we remain on the vanguard of innovation. The automotive retail market is evolving and demand for new and integrated technology solutions is growing – consumers increasingly expect a seamless omnichannel experience when purchasing or servicing vehicles; OEMs see technology as a tool to ensure a consistent and positive customer experience across their retail networks; and retailers are seeking integrated workflow technology solutions to help them improve both customer satisfaction and dealership cost structure. We believe that the best way to compete in a world with numerous providers of unconnected software solutions for numerous automotive retailers, OEMs, consumers, and vehicles is to continue to provide integrated technology solutions and platform tools that can connect the disparate elements to create continuous retail workflows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,340
990_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Business Overview,9.1.3,,"CDK is a leading provider of mission critical, cloud-based software. The Company’s vertical-specific software as a service (“SaaS”) platform enables automotive dealerships to manage their end-to-end business operations including the acquisition, sale, financing, insuring, repair, and maintenance of vehicles. This integrated platform of modern solutions automates and streamlines critical workflows within the dealership which enables dealers to sell and service more vehicles. Not only does this help drive direct improvements in financial and operational performance of the dealership, but it also allows for the simple and convenient experiences for the end buyers of our customer’s products. We generate revenue primarily by providing a broad suite of subscription-based software and technology solutions to automotive retailers in North America. We are focused on the use of SaaS and mobile-centric solutions that are highly functional, flexible, and fast. Our flagship Dealer Management System (“DMS”) software solutions are hosted enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) applications tailored to the unique requirements of the retail automotive industry. Our DMS solutions facilitate most activities within the dealership and are essential to the efficient running of these organizations. This includes activities that generate revenue within a dealership, such as the sale of new and used vehicles, consumer financing, repair and maintenance services, and vehicle and parts inventory management. These solutions also enable our customers to have company-wide accounting, financial reporting, cash flow management, and payroll services. We also provide a broad portfolio of layered software applications and services, a robust, secure, and modern interface to the DMS that connects software developers, OEMs and dealers, data management and business intelligence solutions, a variety of professional services, and a full range of customer support solutions. These additional products are integrated with the DMS and provide a full software solution suite to our customers. Our DMSs are also typically integrated with OEM data processing systems that enable automotive retailers to order vehicles and parts, receive vehicle records, process warranties, and check recall campaigns and service bulletins while helping them to fulfill their franchisee responsibilities to their OEM franchisers. We believe we are the market leader in North America and have the largest installed base of DMSs in the industry. CDK has consistently grown market share and served over 2,700 customers representing over 10,000 dealer sites and adjacent businesses as of March 31, 2023. Within the core automotive space, CDK is primarily focused on the largest and most sophisticated dealerships, with 81% of CDK-served dealerships represented by dealers with three or more sites, which positions the Company to benefit from the consolidation trends in the industry. We are deeply embedded in our customers’ operations – the majority of our customers use three to five CDK products on average, and our average customer tenure is approximately 20 years. The average customer contract length is approximately four years. In the last twelve months (“LTM”) ended March 31, 2023, approximately 79% of our revenue was generated from multi-year subscription contracts where revenue is tied to customer site count, not transaction volume. The strength of our business model is reflected in our financial performance. In the LTM period ended March 31, 2023, we generated approximately $1.9 billion of revenue, which represents a 5% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) since fiscal 2020, and $926.0 million of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, which represents a Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin of approximately 55% including approximately $185 million of margin improvement initiatives that have been actioned or identified by CDK. 1 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,340
990_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Industry Overview,9.2.1,Dealership Consolidation,"The dealership market in North America has experienced continued consolidation in recent years, with the larger dealers (i.e. those with three or more dealership rooftops) driving industry growth. According to McKinsey research, dealers with three or more sites have grown at a CAGR of approximately 1.4% since 2015 while the overall number of rooftops has increased by approximately 0.1%. We expect this consolidation to continue, with key trends such as increasing penetration of electric vehicles (“EVs”) and associated larger capital requirements further accelerating consolidation. According to our research, approximately 66% of all automotive dealerships in North America are expected to be owned by dealers with three or more dealerships by 2026, compared to approximately 50% in 2018. _Source: CDK data as of 2022._ We believe CDK is well positioned to continue to benefit from dealer consolidation. Larger, more sophisticated dealers have more complex software requirements and are CDK’s core customer. CDK offers a differentiated product with ties to OEMs that can be easily adapted to handle the complexities of large dealer groups. As of March 31, 2023, dealers with three or more rooftops represent approximately 81% of CDK-served dealerships. CDK has a leading market share among the largest dealers and currently serves more than 78 of the top 150 largest dealers in North America. As dealer consolidation continues, we believe this will drive additional market share gains and growth in site count. 3 ----- (1) As of March 31, 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2023,340
990_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Industry Overview,9.2.2,Embedded Economic and Operating Moat and Regulatory Landscape,"The dealership model benefits from an embedded economic and operating moat. While OEMs are using digital platforms to optimize the customer journey, dealership networks remain integral to new and used car sales and the service value chain. Dealers are a cost-efficient distribution method for OEMs, and dealerships remain an essential part of the customer journey to provide an omnichannel experience. Consumers increasingly research potential vehicle purchases online, but they still prefer to visit a dealer in order to test drive, complete the purchase and take delivery. Consumers expect a seamless experience across digital and physical channels. According to research from Cox Automotive, 72% of customers seek to finalize the deal in-store and 69% of ‘Gen Z’ consumers agree that faceto-face interaction is critical to the purchasing decision. In addition, the dealership acts as part of a nationwide footprint of service centers for the OEM and helps ensure that a car purchased at one dealer can be serviced by all dealers under that OEM brand. Dealerships are also a collection point and refurbishment hub for used cars. The dealership industry also benefits from a favorable regulatory landscape. Every state in the U.S. has franchise laws that protect existing franchise networks. Specific laws vary on a state-by-state basis but can include: - Outright prohibition on OEMs selling directly against their franchisees; - Requirement for warranty service for vehicles and OEM parts to be provided through the franchise dealers; and - Constraints on ability to terminate franchises, allocate inventory, allocate incentives and impose restrictions on dealer autonomy. The net impact of these regulations is that major OEMs cannot sell under existing brands except through their dealer networks and even new entrants face limitations on their ability to sell direct-to-consumer. We believe these elements create a robust and protective moat around our business. 4 ----- _Source: National Conference of State Legislatures as of June 2022._",N/A,as_expected,2023,340
990_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Industry Overview,9.2.3,Vehicle Electrification and Future of the Dealer,"We expect the automotive market to continue its long-term transition to EVs and expect OEMs to continue to sell EVs through dealers as the economics and regulatory limitations have mostly not changed with the advent of newer technologies. We believe this transition will also reinforce the growing importance of large auto dealers. We believe CDK, with our focus and leadership in the large auto dealer segment, is well positioned to capitalize on and benefit from this shift. Given the inertia that exists in the car parc, we expect the shift to EVs to be a gradual but sustaining transition. Incumbent OEMs – whose dealership’s represent CDK’s core customer base – are also expected to account for the majority of EV sales in the future. New EV only OEMs are expected to make up for only approximately 5% of total light vehicle sales in 2030, with incumbent OEMs making up the remaining 95%. Dealerships will require substantial investment throughout this transition, including building out showrooms and charging infrastructure and training their salesforce and technicians. We believe this required investment will serve as a catalyst to further accelerate the consolidation trends within the industry, with the larger, better capitalized dealers gaining share. As CDK is primarily focused on the largest and most sophisticated dealerships, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from this trend. Increasing penetration of EVs is also expected to improve the profit pools of larger dealerships. While EVs include fewer serviceable parts than internal combustion engine (“ICE”) cars, the total value of parts for an EV is on average approximately two times more expensive than ICE cars due to the electrification systems, and more complex servicing requirements and tooling investment are expected to result in dealers retaining a greater share of servicing from less equipped third-party providers. Higher warranty provisions provided by OEMs on EVs are expected to result in greater revenue for dealers providing the service. The OEM and dealer relationship landscape is also evolving. In the current landscape, OEMs have limited control over pricing and there is a lack of seamless omnichannel experience due to limited OEM-to-dealer connectivity and inconsistent practices among dealers. New entrants (both OEMs and online retailers) have created stronger customer experiences, which is forcing OEMs and dealers to compete. As the evolution continues, we expect OEMs to demand a consistent branded experience (including product information and centrally managed pricing) and dealers will need to scale to provide a superior guest experience for new and used car buying and ownership. This will necessitate close collaboration between the OEM and dealers. We believe dealer consolidation will continue to accelerate and bolster the dealership importance to OEMs – both parties will focus on providing an omnichannel digital retail sales experience, leading to more efficient inventory and costs management. 5 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

We believe our core DMS software is the most comprehensive and adaptive solution in the market, as evidenced by our having the largest installed base in the industry. We serve more than 2,700 customers across auto, representing more than 10,000 dealer sites, as of March 31, 2023. Including DMS, our digital retailing products and CRM standalone applications, we serve approximately 63% of the entire North American market. We also have the highest penetration among the largest dealers, which is the fastest growing segment of the market. As of December 31, 2022, we served 5 of the 10 largest dealers in North America and 78 of the top 150. To enable seamless, omnichannel, and end-to-end automotive commerce, we believe it is critical to provide integrated technology solutions and platforms than can connect automotive retailers, OEMs, consumer, and vehicles. Core to our leadership across automotive commerce is our partnership and presence across all major OEMs. OEMs see technology as a tool to ensure a consistent and positive customer experience across their retail networks. We believe OEM technology programs partner with us because of our installed base and differentiated capabilities. Across the industry, luxury brand dealerships (e.g. BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi) are more often part of larger, multi-site dealers than domestic brands (e.g. Ford or GM) or Asian brands (e.g. Toyota or Honda). As our primary customers are larger, multi-site dealers, our penetration of luxury brands is higher than other brand categories. 6 ----- (1) CDK’s market penetration of dealership sites for each OEM as of March 31, 2023 calculated by weighted average share of respective OEM brands.

990_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strengths,9.3.2,Large and growing market with trends playing to CDK’s strengths and delivering new opportunities,"CDK’s total addressable market (“TAM”) is large, resilient, and growing. Our core DMS software solutions provide full-service ERP applications to dealers and facilitate the sale of new and used vehicles, consumer financing, repair and maintenance services, and vehicle and parts inventory management. Complementary to our core DMS, we also provide broad portfolio of layered software applications and services, data management and business intelligence solutions, a variety of professional services, and a full range of customer support solutions. Our open technology platform allows us and third parties to develop adaptive and interchangeable application 7 ----- programming interfaces (“APIs”) that can be used to connect existing technology solutions and build new solutions reliably and quickly. We have made these strategic investments and acquisitions to expand our TAM from our core DMS offering to include all aspects of selling and servicing vehicles as well as data management and business intelligence solutions. In aggregate, a third party market study estimates our TAM at over $16.3 billion as of January 2022. _Source: Third party market study as of January 2022._ We believe the markets we serve are also poised to benefit from secular trends within automotive retail, including EV adoption and dealer consolidation, consumer focus on seamless and omnichannel digital retail, and increasing value in and complexity of servicing vehicles. - EV adoption is accelerating, and we expect this to drive increased dealer consolidation as the capital investment required and technological complexities will favor larger, more sophisticated, and better capitalized dealers - OEMs, dealers, and consumers are increasingly focused on an omnichannel digital retail sales experience - Vehicles are becoming increasingly connected, with OEMs and dealers placing a premium on data management and interoperability to deliver a modern service experience - We believe service is and will continue to be the biggest catalyst of dealer profitability growth, supported by the EV transition The automotive retail market is evolving and demand for new and integrated technology solutions is only growing. As consumers increasingly expect a seamless omnichannel experience, we believe integrated dealer technology will be essential for OEMs to ensure a consistent and positive customer experience across their retail networks. As a provider of solutions for all aspects of operating a dealership, with industry-leading innovative technologies, a primary focus on larger dealers, and best-in-class software applications and data management, we believe CDK is poised to capture the robust growth opportunities across our various markets. 8 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

Our strategy is and has been to invest for the long-term in integrated software products and an open technology platform that can deliver seamless, end-to-end automotive software solutions to our customers. We believe we offer industry-leading software solutions and have cultivated deeply embedded and highly strategic relationships with both OEMs and dealers over our more than 50 years of year operating history. We believe our historical retention rates demonstrate the quality of our solutions and strength of our customer and partner relationships. CDK’s net revenue retention has improved over the past twelve months due to improvements the company has made to its commercial organization and processes. (1) Net revenue retention rate, which is calculated by dividing revenue earned in a specific period by the revenue earned from the same customers in the corresponding period of the previous year.

990_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strengths,9.3.4,"Long-tenured, highly diversified customer base","CDK benefits from a large and long-tenured customer base that is highly diversified across both dealers and OEMs. As of March 31, 2023, we served more than 2,700 customers across automotive end markets that represented over 10,000 individual dealer sites. Our primary focus is on larger, more complex dealers with three or more sites. These dealers represent approximately 81% of CDK-served dealerships as of March 31, 2023. Across our entire customer base, the average length of relationship is approximately 20 years, which we believe demonstrates the quality of our service offerings, value proposition to our customers, and embedded nature of our solutions within our customers’ sites. Within our end markets we provide solutions to over 2,700 customers that represent more than 10,000 sites as of March 31, 2023. Our largest customer accounts for just 3% of sites, with the top 50 customers accounting for 26% of sites, in each case for the LTM period ended March 31, 2023. This diversification insulates us from the risk of losing a customer or a customer experiencing financial distress, as no individual dealer customer represents a material portion of our total revenue. 9 ----- _Note: Reflects percentage of sites as of March 31, 2023._ Further, our base of automotive customers is also highly diversified by parent manufacturer. For the LTM period ended March 31, 2023, General Motors, Ford and Stellantis dealerships represented approximately 15%, 12%, and 9% of total auto dealer sites, respectively. No other parent manufacturer accounted for greater than 10% of our total auto dealer sites. We believe the diversity in brands that we service further insulates our business from the risk of any individual automotive manufacturer experiencing financial or other distress. _Note: Reflects percentage of sites as of March 31, 2023._ 10 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,340
990_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strengths,9.3.5,"Attractive financial model with highly visible and growing recurring revenue, strong profitability and cash flow combined with actionable margin improvement initiatives","We believe our recurring, subscription-based revenue and highly diversified customer base provide us with a resilient financial profile. These subscription contracts are multi-year in length, and our high retention rates historically have provided us with a consistent base of annual recurring revenue from which to drive organic growth through adding dealer sites and cross selling layered applications to increase the average revenue per site. In the LTM period ended March 31, 2023, approximately 79% of our revenue was generated from these subscription contracts in which revenue is tied to customer site count, not transaction volume. We have grown our recurring revenue base to over $1.4 billion in the LTM period ended March 31, 2023. (1) Reflects year-over-year growth for the LTM period ended March 31, 2023 compared to the twelve month period ended March 31, 2022. (2) Annual recurring revenue refers to revenue generated pursuant to multi-year subscription contracts. We continuously invest in our business and technology which we believe helps us maintain our industry-leading position and market share. In the last several years we have invested and re-deployed capital into early-stage growth businesses, increases in corporate overhead and customer support, and technology modernization. These one-time investments drove a modest compression in Adjusted EBITDA margins from fiscal 2020 through the twelve months 11 ----- ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for the LTM period ended March 31, 2023 was $774.3 million, representing a 41.5% Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Including the impact of actioned and identified margin improvement initiatives, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the LTM period ended March 31, 2023 was 55%. Our business also benefits from relatively low capital expenditure and working capital requirements, which has driven a high Free Cash Flow Conversion historically between 80% and 89% from fiscal 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2022. We have consistently achieved financial results earning status as a Rule of 40 Company, with combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin and revenue growth exceeding 40%.

After Brookfield’s acquisition of CDK, the Company installed an experienced Chief Transformation Officer to lead the margin improvement plan. CDK is targeting approximately $185 million of potential margin benefit from the continued execution of this plan.

The Notes will be, jointly and severally, unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured first lien basis by each of the Issuer’s existing and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the Issuers’ obligations under the Credit Facilities and the Existing First Lien Notes. See “Description of Notes— Guarantees.” As of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, before intercompany eliminations, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 4.9% and 4.9% of our Adjusted Revenue, 7.1% and 8.6% of our Further Adjusted EBITDA and less than 1% and less than 1% of our total assets (excluding cash), respectively. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Claims of holders of the Notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of certain of our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes.” Ranking ......................................................................... The Notes and the related guarantees will be the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ senior secured obligations and will be: - _pari passu in right of payment to all of the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, including the Issuers’ existing and future borrowings under the First Lien Credit 21 ----- Facilities, the Existing First Lien Notes and the Existing Unsecured Notes; - _pari passu in lien priority as to the Collateral with respect to the existing and future senior indebtedness secured by the Collateral on a firstlien basis, including the Issuers’ existing and future borrowings under the First Lien Credit Facilities and the Existing First Lien Notes; - effectively senior in right of payment to (i) all of the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, including the Existing Unsecured Notes, to the extent of the value of the Collateral, and (ii) existing and future junior lien indebtedness of the Issuers and the Guarantors, to the extent of the value of the Collateral; - senior in right of payment to all of the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ existing and future subordinated indebtedness; and - structurally subordinated to any existing and future obligations of any subsidiaries of the Issuers that do not guarantee the Notes.

The Notes and related guarantees will be secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral, which consists of substantially all of the assets that secure the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ obligations under the First Lien Credit Facilities and the Existing First Lien Notes ratably on a pari passu basis with the liens securing the First Lien Credit Facilities and the Existing First Lien Notes, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens as described herein.

Pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent generally (subject to a 180-day “standstill period”) controls substantially all matters related to the Collateral, including with respect to decisions or enforcement, and may take actions that the holders of the Notes may disagree with or that may be contrary to the interests of the holders of the Notes. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement also includes waivers of certain important rights that holders of secured debt would otherwise have. Optional Redemption .................................................... On or after     , 2025 we may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at the redemption prices described in “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” Prior to such date, we may redeem some or all of the Notes at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus a “make-whole” premium.

Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net (loss) income or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We use Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin as additional measures of the performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization less the following: (1) long-term incentive and stock-based compensation; (2) transaction and integration-related costs; (3) business transformation expenses; (4) purchase accounting adjustments; (5) legal and other expenses related to regulatory and competition matters; (6) amortization of equity method investment fair value adjustment; (6) loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt; and (7) costs associated with our business process modernization, workplace optimization programs, officer transition expenses and adjustment for CDK’s share of income or loss in an equity method investment. Further Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for the dispositions of our Heavy Equipment and Recreation businesses. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain non-cash items and other items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Further Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for margin improvement initiatives and other adjustments calculated in a manner consistent with the terms of the instruments that govern our indebtedness and are not included in Adjusted EBITDA. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA has not been prepared as pro forma results under applicable regulations. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is included to provide additional information to investors about certain adjustments calculated in a manner consistent with the terms of the instruments that govern our indebtedness. We believe Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for evaluating our business performance, liquidity and in evaluating potential acquisitions. There are material limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. These measures do not take into account certain significant items, including (i) significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt, (ii) cash requirements for replacing assets, (iii) tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes, (iv) cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures and (v) all GAAP non-cash and non-recurring adjustments. These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently, and by considering Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with net (loss) income as calculated in accordance with GAAP. 31 ----- The following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the periods indicated:",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

We recorded a pre-tax gain of $965.6 million on the sale of the international business. 32 ----- (c) Provision or benefit for income taxes included in the financial statements and excluding amounts attributable to discontinued operations. (d) Interest expense included in the financial statements. (e) Depreciation and amortization included in the financial statements and excluding amounts attributable to discontinued operations. (f) Long-term incentive and stock-based compensation programs are used to drive employee retention. Following the Acquisition, we implemented a long-term incentive program for certain employees, payable based on the achievement of defined targets in future periods. As a public company prior to the Acquisition, our expenses included stock-based compensation expense recognized during the vesting period. The adjustment excludes amounts attributable to discontinued operations. (g) Transaction and integration-related costs include: (i) legal, accounting, outside service fees, and other costs incurred in connection with assessment and integration of acquisitions (including the Acquisition) and other strategic business opportunities and (ii) post-close adjustments to acquisition-related contingent consideration, included in general and administrative expenses. (h) Business transformation expenses predominantly relate to (i) severance and other labor-related expenses associated with corporate actions to reduce Parent’s workforce or shift the location of work to a lower cost market; (ii) certain contract termination costs; (iii) impairments associated with optimizing our facility footprint; and (iv) efforts to modernize our software, improve our customer experience, evolve our products and processes, and ensure we have an optimal cost structure to be resilient and able to invest in innovation. (i) Purchase accounting adjustments represent the add-back of amortization of deferred costs to obtain and fulfill customer contracts written off in the application of business combination accounting in connection with the Acquisition to provide a comparable view of our operating expense profile to prior to the Acquisition. (j) Legal and other expenses, related to regulatory and competition matters included in general and administrative expenses. (k) Equity method investment adjustments relate to the amortization of the fair value assigned to intangible assets of Open Dealer Exchange as a result of the application of business combination accounting to the Acquisition. (l) Net adjustments related to loss from equity method investment includes certain portions of earnings attributable to an equity interest owned by us. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, a $14.5 million impairment of an equity method investment has been included in this adjustment. (m) For the period from July 1 to July 5, 2022, loss on extinguishment of debt related predominantly to the write-off of deferred financing fees associated with the debt tender offers. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, gain on extinguishment of debt related to the forgiveness of Roadster’s indebtedness in connection with the Paycheck Protection Program instituted under the United States’ Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act of 2020. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, this adjustment related to the write off of unamortized debt financing cost as a result of the repayment on March 1, 2021 of indebtedness under our then existing three-year and five-year term loan facilities. (n) Other adjustments include costs associated with (i) our business process modernization program which made investments to reform our business and included the design and implementation of new systems, (ii) our workplace optimization program which included costs to divest non-strategic facilities and some employee termination costs and (iii) officer transition expenses which included severance associated with officer departures. In addition, such adjustments include an equity method investment adjustment pertaining to our share of income or loss in an investment. (o) Excludes amounts attributable to the (i) Heavy Equipment business, which we sold on May 1, 2023 and (ii) Recreation business, which we spun out to a direct subsidiary of Central TopCo Inc. on April 30, 2023.

See “Summary—Our Strengths—Identified margin improvement initiatives.” We cannot assure you that any anticipated cost savings and margin improvements will be achieved or that our estimates and assumptions will prove to be accurate. We will incur costs to execute these margin improvement initiatives that are not reflected in our estimated cost savings. Actual margin improvements may vary from these estimates, and although we target to realize these margin improvement initiatives within the next 18 months, these initiatives will not be realized in the near-term. See “Risk Factors—We may not realize the anticipated cost savings and margin improvements from the Acquisition and our subsequent initiatives.” 33 ----- (q) Other adjustments calculated in a manner consistent with the terms of the instruments that govern our indebtedness and are not included in Adjusted EBITDA, principally (i) purchase accounting adjustments and (ii) interest income on sales-type leases where CDK is the lessor. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA divided by Adjusted Revenue. For more information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures, please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” (5) To provide investors with additional information in connection with our results as determined by GAAP, we disclose Free Cash Flow as a non-GAAP measure which management believes provide useful information to investors. Free Cash Flow is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for operating cash flow, net (loss) income or any other operating or performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Free Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures and capitalized software. We use Free Cash Flow to evaluate our ability to generate cash that can be used for working capital requirements, interest expense, repayment of indebtedness, financing new acquisitions and for continued reinvestment in our business.

Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted Subscription Revenue are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for revenue or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted Revenue is defined as Revenue adjusted to exclude revenue attributable to the Heavy Equipment and Recreation businesses, as well as the revenue associated with the transfer of our Credit Services business to ODE. Under the related agreement, ODE is entitled to the right to receive all revenue and unbilled receivables in respect to our Credit Services business and in exchange for enabling ODE to provide credit products to our automotive dealership customer, we receive a commission. As a result of this transaction, we will no longer report revenue for our Credit Services business and will instead report other revenue for the commission we receive, which results in CDK recognizing future revenue on a net rather than gross basis. Adjusted Subscription Revenue is defined as Subscription Revenue adjusted to exclude subscription revenue attributable to the Heavy Equipment and Recreation businesses, as well as the subscription revenue associated with the transfer of our Credit Services business to ODE. 34 ----- We believe Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted Subscription Revenue provide useful information with respect to the performance of our business because it excludes the impact of the Heavy Equipment and Recreation businesses prior to the date of disposition of such businesses, as well as showing the revenues associated with Credit Services on a consistent basis for all periods.

The industry is highly fragmented and subject to rapidly evolving technology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new solutions. We have a variety of competitors both for our integrated solutions and for each of our individual solutions. For our DMS solutions, our principal competitors are Reynolds and Reynolds, Dealertrack (Cox Automotive), Auto/Mate, Tekion, AutoSoft, PBS Systems and various local and regional providers. Key elements of our business strategy are to strengthen and extend our solutions through intelligence and innovation and to develop and deliver our next generation of solutions. However, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly or effectively to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer demands or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their solutions than we can to ours. Moreover, we may not be successful in responding to these forces and enhancing our products on a timely basis, and any enhancements we develop may not adequately address the changing needs of our customers. We expect the industry to continue to attract new competitors and new technologies, possibly involving alternative technologies that are more sophisticated and cost-effective than our solutions.

To avoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code, we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software. In addition, use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software.

As a result, Brookfield has control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction, regardless of whether the holders of Notes believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. For example, Brookfield could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of our indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, or to sell assets, which may impair our ability to make payments under the Notes. In addition, to the extent permitted by the indenture that will govern the Notes, the indenture that governs our Existing First Lien Notes and the credit agreement that governs our First Lien Credit Facilities, Brookfield may cause us to pay dividends rather than make capital expenditures or otherwise use our funds for the benefit of our business. In addition, Brookfield is in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Brookfield may vote in a manner so as to restrict us from expanding our business or entering into additional lines of business which may be related to the current or future operations of these investments. Also, Brookfield may pursue acquisitions that may be complementary with our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Furthermore, certain of our current or potential future customers may believe the interests of Brookfield conflict with theirs which may impact our ability to attract and retain certain customers.

As a result of the Acquisition, we believe that we will be able to, among other matters, save on our costs by being able to better focus our financial and operational resources on our business, growth profile and strategic priorities. We plan on introducing processes and tools to improve the efficiency in operations through rigorous measurement and managing demand for employee time, as well as prioritizing our spend on research and development to projects with strong returns on investment. In connection with the Acquisition and our subsequent initiatives, we may not fully realize the cost savings and margin improvements that we currently expect, either within the expected time frame, or at all.

Compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our operations increases our costs and may impede our competitiveness. In addition, failure to comply with such laws or regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our ability to do business in applicable jurisdictions or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines or exposure to civil 47 ----- litigation. New regulations and/or changes to existing regulations could require us to modify our business practices, including modify the manner in which we contract with or provide products and services to our customers; directly or indirectly limit how much we can charge for our services; require us to invest additional time and resources to comply with such regulations; or limit our ability to update our existing products and services, or require us to develop new ones. In addition to the data privacy and security laws and regulations mentioned below, our business is also directly or indirectly governed by various laws and regulations relating to issues such as information services, telecommunications, antitrust or competition, employment, motor vehicle and manufacturer licensing or franchising, vehicle registration, advertising, taxation, consumer protection, and accessibility. We must also comply with anticorruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In addition, motor vehicle and manufacturer licensing, franchising and advertising is highly regulated at the state level and is subject to changing legislative, regulatory, political, and other influences. Such state laws are complex and subject to frequent change. The application of this framework of laws and regulations to our business is complex and, in many instances, is unclear or unsettled, which in turn increases our cost of doing business, may interfere with our ability to offer our solutions competitively in one or more jurisdictions and may expose us and our employees to potential fines, penalties, or other enforcement actions. In some cases, our customers may seek to impose additional requirements on our business in efforts to comply with their interpretation of their own or our legal obligations. These requirements may differ significantly from our existing solutions or processes and may require engineering and other costly resources to accommodate. In addition, we are the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, actions, and audits from regulatory authorities, particularly in the area of competition. On June 22, 2017, we received from the FTC a Civil Investigative Demand consisting of interrogatories and a request to produce documents relating to any agreements between the Company and Reynolds and Reynolds. On April 22, 2019, we received a subsequent request to schedule interviews with certain current and former Company employees. Parallel document requests have been received from certain states’ Attorneys General. We have responded to the requests and no proceedings have been instituted. Our last interaction with regulatory authorities with respect to these investigations was with the FTC in May 2021. At this time, we do not have sufficient information to predict the outcome of, or the cost of resolving these investigations. These laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with and may delay or impede the development of new products, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices. Our failure to comply, or to provide solutions that allow our customers to comply, or any new investments of additional time and resources necessary to comply, or to provide solutions that allow our customers to comply, with any of the foregoing laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

Our ability to control the manner in which we provide this robust and secure access to information in our systems, and our pricing model for this service, has been, and will likely continue to be, challenged, dictated and constrained in certain jurisdictions. For example, Arizona, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon have passed legislation that requires us to provide access or integrations to our software to read or write data in our systems. The legislation in some of these states purports to impose such requirements on us at our cost and without markup, or even without compensation, to any third party designated by a dealer licensee of our software, regardless of whether the dealer licensee has title to the data on our systems or the right under its software license to authorize non-licensee third parties access to our systems. In addition, each statute imposes administrative and technical requirements that are inconsistent with our current solutions and capabilities. We believe that compliance with such legislation will impair our ability to provide our customers with robust and secure technology solutions and will increase our risk of data security and privacy breaches, system and data integrity problems, and associated adverse competitive, financial, operational, and reputational impacts. Similar legislation has been 48 ----- proposed in other states and additional states may consider or pass similar legislation. We may incur significant legal and regulatory expenses in connection with assessing or challenging the applicability of this legislation to our products and offerings and while we seek legal, regulatory, or policy solutions to address concerns with respect to the validity of the legislation or our ability to comply with it. Ultimately, our failure to comply, or to provide solutions that allow our customers to comply, or any new investments of additional time and resources necessary to comply, or to provide solutions that allow our customers to comply, with this legislation will increase our operating costs and reduce our revenue, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims, adjustments to our business practices, penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in customer growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.","Many U.S. and foreign jurisdictions have passed, or are currently contemplating, a variety of consumer protection, privacy, and data security laws and regulations that may relate directly or indirectly to our business. For example, federal laws and regulations governing privacy and security of consumer information generally apply to our customers and/or to us as a service provider. These include, but are not limited to, the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, the GLB Act and regulations implementing its information safeguarding requirements, the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (the “CAN-SPAM Act”), the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Do-Not-Call-Implementation Act, applicable Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) telemarketing rules (including the declaratory ruling affirming the blocking of unwanted robocalls), the FTC Privacy Rule, Safeguards Rule, Consumer Report Information Disposal Rule, Telemarketing Sales Rule, Risk-Based Pricing Rule, Red Flags Rule, and California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. Laws of foreign jurisdictions, such as Canada’s Anti-Spam Law and Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, and European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) similarly apply to our collection, processing, storage, use, and transmission of protected data. In the U.S., some state laws and regulations have imposed, and others have contemplated imposing, enhanced disclosure obligations and greater restrictions or prohibitions on the use of data than are already contained in federal laws such as the GLB Act and its implementing regulations or the FTC rules described above. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, effective as of January 1, 2020 and as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) as of January 1, 2023 (collectively, the “CCPA”), provides California consumers with a greater level of transparency and broader rights and choices with respect to their personal information than those contained in any existing state and federal laws in the U.S. The “personal information” regulated by the CCPA is broadly defined to include any information that identifies or is reasonably capable of being associated with or linked, directly or indirectly, with a California consumer or household, including, for example, demographics, usage, transactions and inquiries, preferences, inferences drawn to create a profile about a consumer. Compliance with the CCPA requires the implementation of a series of operational measures such as preparing data maps, inventories, or other records of all personal information pertaining to California residents, households and devices, as well as information sources, usage, storage, and sharing, maintaining and updating detailed disclosures in privacy policies, establishing mechanisms to respond to consumers’ data access, deletion, portability, and opt-out requests, etc. The CCPA is enforced by both the Office of the Attorney General of California and the newly-established California Privacy Protection Agency, and failure to fully comply can result in regulatory fines of up to $2,500 per violation (which has been interpreted to mean per impacted individual) and civil penalties up to $7,500 per violation for knowing or willful violations. The CCPA further allows consumers to file lawsuits against a business if a data breach involving certain sensitive information has occurred as a result of the business’ violation of the duty to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices. This private right of action and the significant outstanding uncertainties in the interpretation, application and enforcement of key CCPA provisions may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. To comply with the CCPA and assist many of our customers who are subject to the CCPA to comply with the CCPA, we have modified or adjusted the design, development, and delivery of our products and services in a significant way. However, with further clarifications and interpretations of the CCPA and/or any new laws and regulations, additional modifications and adjustments may be required, which may result in significant costs and 49 ----- expenses, and any delay or failure to make such changes may negatively affect our customers’ confidence in or perception of our product and services, result in their ceasing to use our products or services or even lawsuits and significant liabilities. In addition, all 50 states have passed data breach notification laws that require notifications to affected consumers, attorneys general, consumer protection agencies and/or other government authorities when there is a breach of personal data, and provide consumers with credit monitoring and other remedies. Any data breaches and the related notifications and remedies may result in significant compliance costs in addition to potential liability and reputational damage. From time to time, we may utilize artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics and similar tools that collect, aggregate and analyze data (collectively, “Data Tools”) in connection with our business. There are significant risks involved in utilizing Data Tools and no assurance can be provided that the usage of such Data Tools will enhance our business or assist our business in being more efficient or profitable. Data Tools may have errors or inadequacies that are not easily detectable. For example, certain Data Tools may utilize historical market or sector data in their analytics. To the extent that such historical data is not indicative of the current or future conditions in the applicable market or sector, or the Data Tools fail to filter biases in the underlying data or collection methods, the usage of Data Tools may lead us to make determinations on behalf of our business, including potentially purchase and sale decisions, that have an adverse effect. Data Tools may also be subject to data herding and interconnectedness (i.e., multiple market participants utilizing the same data), which may adversely impact our business. If Data Tools are incorrectly designed or the data used to train them is incomplete, inadequate or biased in some way, our use of Data Tools may inadvertently reduce our efficiency or cause unintentional or unexpected outputs that are incorrect, do not match our business goals, do not comply with our policies or interfere with the performance of our products, services, business and reputation. Additionally, our reliance on Data Tools could pose ethical concerns and lead to a lack of human oversight and control, which could have negative implications for our organization. In addition, the use of Data Tools may enhance intellectual property, cybersecurity, operational and technological risks. The technologies underlying Data Tools and their use cases are subject to a variety of laws, including intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection and federal equal opportunity laws. If we do not have sufficient rights to use the data on which Data Tools rely, we may incur liability through the violation of such laws, third-party privacy or other rights or contracts to which we are a party. Furthermore, the technologies underlying Data Tools are complex and rapidly developing, and as a result, it is not possible to predict all of the legal, operational or technological risks related to the use of Data Tools. Moreover, Data Tools are the subject of evolving review by various governmental and regulatory agencies, including the SEC and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and changes in laws, rules, directives and regulations governing the use of Data Tools may adversely affect the ability of our business to use Data Tools. The costs and other burdens of compliance with privacy and data security laws and regulations could negatively impact the use and adoption of our solutions and reduce overall demand for them. Additionally, evolving concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers, or their customers and potential customers, to resist providing the data necessary to allow us to deliver our solutions effectively. Even the perception that personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our solutions and any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could lead to significant fines, penalties, or other liabilities.

The computation of the provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities is complex, as it is based on the laws of numerous taxing jurisdictions and requires significant judgment regarding the application of complicated rules governing accounting for tax provisions under GAAP. The provision for income taxes may require forecasts of effective tax rates for the year, which include assumptions and forward looking financial projections, including the expectations of profit and loss by jurisdiction. Various items cannot be accurately forecasted and future events may materially differ from our forecasts. Our provision for income tax could be materially impacted by a number of factors, including changes in the geographical mix of our profits and losses, changes in our business, such as internal restructuring and acquisitions, changes in tax laws and accounting guidance and other regulatory, legislative or judicial developments, tax audit determinations, changes in our uncertain tax positions, changes in our intent and ability to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings, changes in our ability to utilize foreign tax credits, changes to our transfer pricing practices, tax deductions associated with stock-based compensation, and changes in our need for deferred tax valuation allowances. Any changes in corporate income tax laws or any implementation of tax laws relating to corporate tax reform, could significantly impact our overall tax liability. For these reasons, our actual tax liabilities in a future period may be materially different than our income tax provision. In addition, changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate.

Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness, including the Notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and (if they are not Guarantors of the Notes) their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are the Guarantors of the Notes, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the Notes or to make funds available to the Issuers or the Guarantor subsidiaries for that purpose. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions or repay intercompany loans to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes. Each non-guarantor subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our non-guarantor subsidiaries. While the indenture that will govern the Notes will limit, and the indenture that governs the Existing First Lien Notes limits, the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to the Issuers, these limitations will be subject to certain qualifications and exceptions.

Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the Notes or the guarantees thereof and related liens could be avoided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if an Issuer or a Guarantor, as applicable, (i) issued the Notes, incurred its guarantee or granted related liens with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (ii) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the Notes or incurring the guarantee or granting related liens and, in the case of (ii) only, one of the following is also true at the time thereof: - such Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Notes, the incurrence of its guarantees or the granting of related liens; - the issuance of the Notes, the incurrence of its guarantees or the granting of related liens left such Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on the business as engaged in or contemplated; - such Issuer or such Guarantor intended to, or believed that it would, incur indebtedness beyond its ability to pay as they mature; or - such Issuer or such Guarantor was a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages docketed against it if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A court would likely find that a Guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee to the extent the Guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes or related Liens. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the relevant Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the Guarantor, the obligations of the applicable Guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the guarantees (and any related liens), subordinate them to the applicable Guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the Notes. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied, such that we cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not any Issuer or any Guarantor was insolvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that the relevant Issuer or a Guarantor was indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the Notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers on other grounds; or that the issuance of the Notes and the guarantees would not otherwise be avoided or subordinated to our or any Guarantor’s other indebtedness. In general, however, a court would deem an entity insolvent if: - the sum of its indebtedness, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing indebtedness, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its indebtedness as it becomes due. 56 ----- If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes, the incurrence of a guarantee or the granting of related liens was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other reviewable transaction, the court could avoid the payment obligations under the Notes or that guarantee or any related liens, could subordinate the Notes or that guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the relevant Issuer or of the relevant Guarantor or could require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or that guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other reviewable transaction occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the Notes or the benefit of any related liens. The indenture that will govern the Notes will also permit guarantees by foreign subsidiaries, if applicable, to be limited to the extent necessary to comply with applicable local law, and these limitations could limit the value of the guarantees. Further, the avoidance of the Notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other indebtedness that could result in acceleration of that indebtedness. Although the indenture that will govern the Notes will contain a “savings clause” intended to limit a Guarantor’s liability under its guarantee to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter or otherwise to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer law or otherwise, or may reduce that Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. In addition, any payment or any other transfer (including the granting and/or perfection of a lien by the relevant Issuer or the relevant Guarantors under the Notes or a guarantee and/or any related collateral agreement) could be avoided and required to be returned to such Issuer or such Guarantors, as the case may be, or deposited in a fund for the benefit of the creditors of such Issuer or Guarantor (or in the case of such a lien, avoided and/or terminated). Among other things, a payment or lien could potentially be avoided if such payment or lien is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any non-insider party, and such payment or lien would give such insider or non-insider party more than such party would have received in a distribution in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case under Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (the “Bankruptcy Code”). Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes to other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (i) the holder of Notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (ii) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of Notes and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

Under the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the Applicable Collateral Agent, is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which potentially may not be given under the particular facts and circumstances). Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral (including cash collateral), and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral, even if the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. In view of the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court and the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection”, it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the secured notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments), whether or when the Applicable Collateral Agent would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, whether or to what extent holders of the secured notes would be compensated for any delay in payment of loss of value of the collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection” or otherwise, or the value of the Collateral as of the commencement of any bankruptcy case or at any time thereafter. Furthermore, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes (after taking into account all other Additional Pari Passu Obligations), the holders of the Notes would have “undersecured claims” as to the difference and would not be entitled to post-petition interest, fees, or expenses or “adequate protection” with respect to such difference. Federal bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs and attorneys’ fees to creditors holding “undersecured claims” during the debtor’s bankruptcy case. In addition, as described further above and in the Description of Notes, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will limit the ability of the holders of the Notes to raise certain objections following the commencement of any bankruptcy case. See “Even though the holders of the Notes will benefit from first-priority liens on the Collateral, the representative of the lenders under the First Lien Credit Facilities will initially have the exclusive right to control actions (including the exercise of remedies) (or to direct the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent to do the same) with respect to the Collateral.”",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

990_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,Risks Related to the Collateral,13.4.5,It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes.,"The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections as may be accepted by the creditors that have the benefit of first liens on the Collateral securing the Notes from time to time, whether on or after the date the Notes are issued. The initial purchasers did not analyze the effect of, nor participate in, any negotiations relating to, such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes as well as the ability of the Applicable Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. In the event that a bankruptcy or other insolvency case is commenced by or against us, if the value of the Collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and all other Additional Pari Passu Obligations, interest, fees and expenses would generally cease to accrue on the Notes from and after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed or other insolvency proceeding commenced. In addition, our business requires numerous federal, state and local permits and licenses. Continued operation of properties that are the Collateral securing the Notes depends on the maintenance of such permits and licenses. Our business is subject to substantial regulations and permitting requirements and may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with existing regulations or requirements or changes in applicable regulations or requirements. In the event of foreclosure or other enforcement of security, the transfer of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require us to incur significant cost and expense. Further, we cannot assure you that the applicable governmental authorities will consent to the transfer of all such permits. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not obtained or are delayed, the foreclosure or other enforcement of security may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may result and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased.",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if the Applicable Collateral Agent is not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens on or prior to the issue date of the Notes. In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified and additional steps to perfect in such property and rights are taken. The Issuers and the Guarantors will have limited obligations to perfect the security interest of the holders of the Notes in the Collateral. There can be no assurance that the trustee or the Applicable Collateral Agent will monitor, or that we will inform such trustee or Applicable Collateral Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral securing the Notes, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired Collateral. The Applicable Collateral Agent has no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that could constitute Collateral securing the Notes or the perfection of any security interest. This may result in the loss of the security interest in the Collateral securing the Notes or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties. In addition, even if the Applicable Collateral Agent does properly perfect such liens, any such liens perfected after the issue date for the Notes may potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy proceeding under certain circumstances. See “Any future pledge of Collateral or guarantee provided after the Notes are issued might be avoided by us or by a trustee in bankruptcy.” In addition, the security interest of the Applicable Collateral Agent will be subject to practical challenges generally associated with the realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, the Applicable Collateral Agent may need to obtain the consent of third parties and make additional filings. If we are unable to obtain these consents or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the holders will not be entitled to the affected Collateral or any recovery with respect thereto. We cannot assure you that the Applicable Collateral Agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure or other security enforcement on such assets. Accordingly, the 62 ----- Applicable Collateral Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon or otherwise enforce against those assets and the value of the affected Collateral may significantly decrease.",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

As a result, it is possible that the insurance proceeds will not compensate us fully for our losses in the event of a catastrophic loss. If there is a total or partial loss of any of the Collateral, we cannot assure you that any insurance proceeds received by us will be sufficient to satisfy all the first lien secured obligations, including the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

In addition, certain assets, including Excluded Assets, will be excluded from the Collateral.","Subject to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the security documents allow us to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from, the Collateral. For example, so long as no event of default under the indenture governing the Notes would result therefrom, we may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Trustee, conduct activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making cash payments (including repayments of indebtedness). The lien on the Collateral will be automatically released upon any permitted disposition thereof to a person that is not an Issuer or Guarantor of the Notes. See “Description of Notes.” In addition, certain assets, including Excluded Assets, will be excluded from the Collateral. See “Description of Notes—Security” for the definition of “Excluded Assets.”",N/A,as_expected,2023,340
990_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,Risks Related to the Collateral,13.4.9,Any future pledge of Collateral or guarantee provided after the Notes are issued might be avoided by us or by a trustee in bankruptcy.,"The indenture governing the Notes and the collateral documents will require us to cause any domestic subsidiary that guarantees the First Lien Credit Facilities or the Existing First Lien Notes of the Issuers to provide a guarantee of the Notes and will require us to cause such Guarantor to grant liens on certain assets that we or any such Guarantor holds at the time the Notes are issued or acquires after the Notes are issued. Any future guarantee or additional lien in favor of the Applicable Collateral Agents for the benefit of the holders of the Notes might be avoidable by the grantor (as debtor-in possession) or by a trustee in bankruptcy or other third parties if certain events or circumstances exist or occur. For instance, if the entity granting a future guarantee or additional lien was insolvent at the time of the grant and if such grant was made within 90 days before that entity commenced a bankruptcy proceeding (or one year before commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding if the creditor that benefited from the guarantee or lien is an “insider” under the Bankruptcy Code), and the granting of the future guarantee or additional lien enabled the holders of the Notes to receive more than they would if the grantor were liquidated under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, then such guarantee or lien could be avoided as a preferential transfer. Liens recorded or perfected after the issue date may be treated under bankruptcy law as if they were delivered to secure previously existing indebtedness. In bankruptcy proceedings commenced within 90 days of lien perfection (or one year for insiders), a lien given to secure previously existing indebtedness is materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the issue date (or within a 30-day safe harbor provided for in the Bankruptcy Code). Accordingly, if we or any Guarantor of the Notes were to file for bankruptcy or other insolvency protection after the issue date with respect to the Notes being offered hereby and the liens had been perfected less than 90 days (one year for insiders)before the commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, the liens securing the Notes may be subject to challenge as a preference as a result of having been delivered after the issue date of the Notes. To the extent that such challenge succeeded, the holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the security that the Collateral was intended to provide and could be required to return payments previously received. 63 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

The Company’s vertical-specific SaaS platform enables automotive dealerships to manage their end-to-end business operations including the acquisition, sale, financing, insuring, repair, and maintenance of vehicles. This integrated platform of modern solutions automates and streamlines critical workflows within the dealership which enables dealers to sell and service more vehicles. Not only does this help drive direct improvements in financial and operational performance of the dealership, but it also allows for the simple and convenient experiences for the end buyers of our customer’s products. We generate revenue primarily by providing a broad suite of subscription-based software and technology solutions to automotive retailers in North America. We are focused on the use of SaaS and mobile-centric solutions that are highly functional, flexible, and fast. Our flagship DMS software solutions are hosted ERP applications tailored to the unique requirements of the retail automotive industry. Our DMS solutions facilitate most activities within the dealership and are essential to the efficient running of these organizations. This includes activities that generate revenue within a dealership, such as the sale of new and used vehicles, consumer financing, repair and maintenance services, and vehicle and parts inventory management. These solutions also enable our customers to have company-wide accounting, financial reporting, cash flow management, and payroll services. We also provide a broad portfolio of layered software applications and services, a robust, secure, and modern interface to the DMS that connects software developers, OEMs and dealers, data management and business intelligence solutions, a variety of professional services, and a full range of customer support solutions. These additional products are integrated with the DMS and provide a full software solution suite to our customers. Our DMSs are also typically integrated with OEM data processing systems that enable automotive retailers to order vehicles and parts, receive vehicle records, process warranties, and check recall campaigns and service bulletins while helping them to fulfill their franchisee responsibilities to their OEM franchisers. We believe we are the market leader in North America and have the largest installed base of DMSs in the industry. CDK has consistently grown market share and served over 2,700 customers representing over 10,000 dealer sites and adjacent businesses as of March 31, 2023. Within the core automotive space, CDK is primarily focused on the largest and most sophisticated dealerships, with 81% of CDK-served dealerships represented by dealers with three or more sites, which positions the Company to benefit from the consolidation trends in the industry. We are deeply embedded in our customers’ operations – the majority of our customers use three to five CDK products on average, and our average customer tenure is approximately 20 years. The average customer contract length is approximately four years. In the LTM period ended March 31, 2023, approximately 79% of our revenue was generated from multi-year subscription contracts where revenue is tied to customer site count, not transaction volume. The strength of our business model is reflected in our financial performance. In the LTM period ended March 31, 2023, we generated approximately $1.9 billion of revenue, which represents a 5% CAGR since fiscal 2020, and $926.0 million of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, which represents a Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin of approximately 55% including approximately $185 million of margin improvement initiatives that have been actioned or identified by CDK. ----- Key metrics we use to measure and evaluate our segment operating performance are Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Conversion, Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted Subscription Revenue.

All of CDK’s then-outstanding common stock, including outstanding stock-based compensation awards and restricted stock shares issued under CDK’s 2014 Omnibus Award Plan, and over 93% of its then-outstanding long-term debt were tendered for cash totaling $8,312.6 million. The $8,312.6 million acquisition price was funded by $3,413.0 million of cash infused by Brookfield and affiliates and by $4,899.6 million, net of origination costs and discount, from new debt facilities arranged to complete the acquisition. The $8,312.6 million of consideration was allocated to net tangible and intangible assets with a fair value of $3,923.5 million and to goodwill in the amount of $4,389.1 million. 68 ----- CDK elected to apply pushdown accounting with respect to the Acquisition, as permitted by GAAP, whereby the acquisition-date fair values assigned to CDK’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the acquirer were pushed down to the financial statements of CDK. Since CDK’s post-Acquisition financial statements reflect a new basis of accounting due to pushdown accounting applied by CDK, CDK’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for periods before and after the date of the Acquisition are not comparable. Therefore, in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” CDK’s financial information for periods prior to and including July 5, 2022 are referred to as the predecessor periods (“Predecessor”) and the periods subsequent to and including July 6, 2022 are referred to as the successor periods (“Successor”). In connection with the Acquisition, CDK also changed its annual reporting year end from June 30 to December 31 to align with Brookfield’s annual reporting period. This “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” includes comparative combined financial information, which management believes provides valuable and relevant analyses to fully discuss operating trends and changes.

There continues to be a shortage of available new vehicles for sale as compared to historical inventory levels driven largely by disruptions in the manufacturers’ supply chains. Although new vehicle inventory levels for certain manufacturers improved during the last twelve months, the demand for vehicles generally continued to exceed supply throughout the year. This demand and supply imbalance continues to result in higher levels of profitability for available new vehicles. The reduced levels of total new vehicle availability is currently expected to continue into the remainder of 2023, however, there is still significant uncertainty as to the extent to which new vehicle availability will improve, as well as duration and/or degree of the higher levels of profitability being realized during this time. In addition, the decline in new vehicle unit volume could adversely impact the availability of nearly new vehicle inventory. Additionally, worsening economic conditions, including inflationary pressures and rising interest rates, could adversely impact consumer demand for vehicles. We also expect to see the continued consolidation of dealers into larger dealer groups that could further enhance our position as a strategic partner with larger dealer groups. To some extent, our business is impacted by these trends, either directly through a shift in the number of transactions processed by customers of our transactional business, or indirectly through changes in our customers’ spending habits based on their own changes in profitability. Overall, we believe we are well positioned for further growth opportunities and we remain committed to our business strategy of serving our dealer customers.",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

We use Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin as additional measures of the performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization less the following: (1) long-term incentive and stock-based compensation; (2) transaction and integration-related costs; (3) business transformation expenses; (4) purchase accounting adjustments; (5) legal and other expenses related to regulatory and competition matters; (6) amortization of equity method investment fair value adjustment; (6) loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt; and (7) costs associated with our business process modernization, workplace optimization programs, officer transition expenses and adjustment for CDK’s share of income or loss in an equity method investment.

Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Further Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for margin improvement initiatives and other adjustments calculated in a manner consistent with the terms of the instruments that govern our indebtedness and are not included in Adjusted EBITDA. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA has not been prepared as pro forma results under applicable regulations. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is included to provide additional information to investors about certain adjustments calculated in a manner consistent with the terms of the instruments that govern our indebtedness. We believe Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for evaluating our business performance, liquidity and in evaluating potential acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.

As of March 31, 2023 (Successor), unrestricted cash and cash equivalents were $97.4 million to fund our general working capital needs, total stockholder's equity was $3,367.3 million, and total debt was $4,963.8 million, net of unamortized issuance costs and an original issue discount of $209.4 million. Working capital as of March 31, 2023 (Successor) was $171.0 million, as compared to $127.7 million as of December 31, 2022 (Predecessor). Working capital as presented herein excludes current maturities of long-term debt and finance lease liabilities and net assets held for sale. Our primary cash needs are for working capital, capital expenditures, operating expenses, acquisitions, the repayment of principal and the payment of interest on our indebtedness. Our historical change in net working capital, excluding change in deferred revenue, has not been a material use of cash (averaging approximately $10.0 million use of cash annually). Changes in deferred revenue have historically been a source of cash given the subscription nature of our business. We believe that our current cash and equivalents, along with cash flows from operations and unused availability under the Revolving Facility will be sufficient to fund our current operating requirements over the next twelve months. Our liquidity and our ability to meet our outstanding borrowings and fund our capital and other requirements are also dependent on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic and market conditions and other factors that are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings or equity financings will be available to meet our liquidity needs. If we were unable to generate new contracts with existing and new customers, if the level of contract cancellations increased, or if contract delays lengthen or increase, our cash flow from operations would be materially adversely affected. We anticipate that to the extent we need additional liquidity, it will be funded through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, equity financings or a combination thereof. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain this additional liquidity on reasonable terms or at all. Although we have no current plans to do so, if we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions or significant internal growth initiatives, we may incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance such acquisitions or initiatives. For information on our outstanding debt and borrowing capacity, see “Note 14, Debt” to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and “Note 10, Debt” to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements.

990_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.20,Critical Accounting Policies,17.20.1,Revenue Recognition,"We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”). We determine the amount of revenue to be recognized through the following steps: - Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; - Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; - Determination of the transaction price; - Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and - Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy the performance obligations. The majority of our revenue is generated from contracts with multiple performance obligations. A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in ASC 606. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. We are required to estimate the total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers. In limited circumstances, the consideration expected to be received may be variable based on the specific terms of the contract. We rarely license or sell products or services on a standalone basis. As such, we are required to develop the best estimate of standalone selling price of each distinct good or service as the basis for allocating the total transaction price. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the adjusted market assessment approach, with some product categories using the expected cost plus a margin approach. When establishing standalone selling price, we consider various factors which may include geographic region, current market trends, customer class, its market share and position, its general pricing practices for bundled products and services, and recent contract sales data. We apply significant judgment in order to identify and determine the number of performance obligations, estimate the total transaction price, determine the allocation of the transaction price to each identified performance obligation, and determine the appropriate method and timing of revenue recognition. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis; that is, such taxes are excluded from revenue. We generate revenue from the following three categories: subscription, transaction, and other. We do not evaluate a contract for a significant financing component if payment is expected within one year from the transfer of the promised items to the customer. 86 ----- _Subscription_ CDK provides software and technology solutions for automotive retailers and OEMs, which includes: - DMSs and layered applications, where the software is hosted and provided on a SaaS basis, including ongoing maintenance and support. - Interrelated services such as installation, initial training, and data updates; and - Prior to adoption of ASC 842, subscription revenue included technology solutions in which hardware was provided on a service basis. This revenue was previously classified as subscription revenue because, under lease accounting guidance in effect prior to ASC 842, substitution rights were considered substantive. SaaS and other hosted service arrangements, which allow the customer continuous access to the software over the contract period without taking control of the software, are provided on a subscription basis. We have concluded that under its SaaS and hosted service arrangements, the customer obtains access to our software which resides and is maintained on its managed servers. The customer does not obtain the right to take possession of the software. As such, we have concluded that its SaaS and hosted services arrangements do not include a software license. Furthermore, the Company has concluded that while the support and maintenance and hosting services are capable of being distinct performance obligations, the obligations are not distinct within the context of the contract. In addition, as the support and maintenance and hosting services are provided over the same period and have the same pattern of transfer of control, the support and maintenance and hosting services are combined and recognized as a single performance obligation. We may provide new customers with interrelated setup activities such as installation, initial training and data updates that we must undertake to fulfill the contract. These are considered fulfillment activities that do not transfer service to the customer. In addition to the core DMS software application, the customer may also contract for layered applications, which are each considered a distinct performance obligation. Revenue for SaaS and other hosted service arrangements, are recognized ratably over the duration of the contract. We have determined its obligation under these arrangements is to stand ready to perform the underlying services as required by the customer. The customer receives the benefit of the services and we have the right to payment as the services are performed. A time-elapsed output method is used to measure progress as we transfer control evenly over the duration of the contract. _Transaction_ We receive fees per transaction for providing auto retailers interfaces with third parties to process credit reports, vehicle registrations, and automotive equity mining. Transaction revenue varies based on the volume of transactions processed. For transaction revenue, we have a right to payment as the transactions are performed in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer. As such, we recognize transaction revenue as the services are rendered and in the amount to which it has the right to invoice. Transaction revenue for credit report processing and automotive equity mining is recorded in revenue on a gross basis, incurred when we are substantively and contractually responsible for providing the service, software, and/or connectivity to the customer, and controls the specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer. We recognize vehicle registration revenue net of the state registration fee since it is acting as an agent and does not control the related goods and services before they are transferred to the customer. _Other_ We provide consulting and professional services, including marketing campaign solutions, and sells hardware such as laser printers, networking and telephony equipment, and related items. Consulting and professional services are either billed on a time and materials basis or on a fixed monthly, quarterly or semi-annual basis based on the amount of services contracted. Revenue from these services is recorded when our obligation is satisfied. Where our obligation is to provide continuous services throughout the contract period and the customer receives the benefit of those services as they are performed, we recognize services revenue over time using a time-elapsed output method as we believe the passage of time faithfully depicts the transfer of services to its customers. Where the professional service represents a single performance obligation, the customer receives the benefit of the services only upon their 87 ----- completion, and we do not have the right to payment as the services are performed, such services revenue is recognized upon completion. We often sell hardware bundled with maintenance services and has concluded that these bundles include two distinct performance obligations. The first performance obligation is to transfer the hardware product and the second performance obligation is to provide maintenance on the hardware and its embedded software. As such, the transaction price allocated to the sold hardware is recognized upon delivery at which point the customer is able to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the hardware. Upon delivery of the hardware, we generally have the right to payment, the customer has legal title, physical possession of, and control of the hardware. The transaction price allocated to the maintenance of hardware and its embedded software is recognized ratably over the duration of the contract as the customer simultaneously consumes and receives the benefit of this maintenance. We have determined its obligation under these arrangements is to stand ready to perform the underlying services as required by the customer. A time-elapsed output method is used to measure progress as we transfer control evenly over the duration of the contract. Hardware maintenance is included in subscription revenue. After the adoption of ASC 842, Other revenue also includes leasing revenue from hardware where the customer has a right of use during the contract term under ASC 842, as hardware substitution rights are not considered substantive. Also included in the Other category are on-site software arrangements which include a license of intellectual property as the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software and the customer can either run the software on its own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to us to host the software. The customer receives the right to use the software license upon its installation for the term of the arrangement. As such, we have concluded that the software license is a distinct performance obligation and recognizes the transaction price allocated to on-site software upon installation. We also provide maintenance and support of the software applications. Such maintenance and support services may include server and desktop support, bug fixes, and support resolving other issues a customer may encounter in utilizing the software. Revenue allocated to maintenance and support is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given the support and maintenance comprise distinct performance obligations that are satisfied ratably over time. A time-elapsed output method is used to measure progress as we transfer control evenly over the duration of the contract. Accordingly, maintenance and support revenue for on-site licenses is included in subscription revenue.",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

With multi-location management ability, dealers receive real-time data with actionable insights to deliver immediate business improvements. Our DMS products facilitate the sale of new and used vehicles, consumer financing, repair and maintenance services, and vehicle and parts inventory management.

Complementary to our core DMS, we also provide a portfolio of layered software applications and services to address the unique needs of automotive retail workflows. In recent years, we have strategically focused on delivering solutions that solve key pain points for our customers and simplifying their software vendors onto one fully integrated software platform. This includes consolidating technology vendors within a dealer location and removing friction from the vehicle-buying experience. Specifically, we digitized critical pieces of the sales process with products such as ELEAD CRM, Digital Contracting and eSign. Our Roadster and digital retailing offering provide capabilities to enable dealers to sell new and used vehicles completely online, while also giving consumers the option to begin and end the vehicle-buying process anywhere they choose – online or in-store.

Not only does this help drive direct improvements in financial and operational performance of the dealership, but it also allows for the simple and convenient experiences for the end buyers of our customer’s products. We generate revenue primarily by providing a broad suite of subscription-based software and technology solutions to automotive retailers in North America. We are focused on the use of SaaS and mobile-centric solutions that are highly functional, flexible, and fast. Our flagship DMS software solutions are hosted ERP applications tailored to the unique requirements of the retail automotive industry. Our DMS solutions facilitate most activities within the dealership and are essential to the efficient running of these organizations. This includes activities that generate revenue within a dealership, such as the sale of new and used vehicles, consumer financing, repair and maintenance services, and vehicle and parts inventory management. These solutions also enable our customers to have company-wide accounting, financial reporting, cash flow management, and payroll services. We also provide a broad portfolio of layered software applications and services, a robust, secure, and modern interface to the DMS that connects software developers, OEMs and dealers, data management and business intelligence solutions, a variety of professional services, and a full range of customer support solutions.

CDK has consistently grown market share and served over 2,700 customers representing over 10,000 dealer sites and adjacent businesses as of March 31, 2023. Within the core automotive space, CDK is primarily focused on the largest and most sophisticated dealerships, with 81% of CDK-served dealerships represented by dealers with three or more sites, which positions the Company to benefit from the consolidation trends in the industry. We are deeply embedded in our customers’ operations – the majority of our customers use three to five CDK products on average, and our average customer tenure is approximately 20 years. The average customer contract length is approximately four years. In the LTM period ended March 31, 2023, approximately 79% of our revenue was generated from multi-year subscription contracts where revenue is tied to customer site count, not transaction volume. The strength of our business model is reflected in our financial performance.

According to McKinsey research, dealers with three or more sites have grown at a CAGR of approximately 1.4% since 2015 while the overall number of rooftops has increased by approximately 0.1%. We expect this consolidation to continue, with key trends such as increasing penetration of EVs and associated larger capital requirements further accelerating consolidation. According to our research, approximately 66% of all automotive dealerships in North America are expected to be owned by dealers with three or more dealerships by 2026, compared to approximately 50% in 2018. _Source: CDK data as of 2022._ We believe CDK is well positioned to continue to benefit from dealer consolidation. Larger, more sophisticated dealers have more complex software requirements and are CDK’s core customer. CDK offers a differentiated product with ties to OEMs that can be easily adapted to handle the complexities of large dealer groups. As of March 31, 2023, dealers with three or more rooftops represent approximately 81% of CDK-served dealerships. CDK has a leading market share among the largest dealers and currently serves more than 78 of the top 150 largest dealers in North America.

990_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,212,BUSINESS,212.2,Industry Overview,212.2.2,Embedded Economic and Operating Moat and Regulatory Landscape,"The dealership model benefits from an embedded economic and operating moat. While OEMs are using digital platforms to optimize the customer journey, dealership networks remain integral to new and used car sales and the service value chain. Dealers are a cost-efficient distribution method for OEMs, and dealerships remain an essential part of the customer journey to provide an omnichannel experience. Consumers increasingly research potential vehicle purchases online, but they still prefer to visit a dealer in order to test drive, complete the purchase and take delivery. Consumers expect a seamless experience across digital and physical channels. According to research from Cox Automotive, 72% of customers seek to finalize the deal in-store and 69% of ‘Gen Z’ consumers agree that faceto-face interaction is critical to the purchasing decision. In addition, the dealership acts as part of a nationwide footprint of service centers for the OEM and helps ensure that a car purchased at one dealer can be serviced by all dealers under that OEM brand. Dealerships are also a collection point and refurbishment hub for used cars. The dealership industry also benefits from a favorable regulatory landscape. Every state in the U.S. has franchise laws that protect existing franchise networks. Specific laws vary on a state-by-state basis but can include: - Outright prohibition on OEMs selling directly against their franchisees; - Requirement for warranty service for vehicles and OEM parts to be provided through the franchise dealers; and - Constraints on ability to terminate franchises, allocate inventory, allocate incentives and impose restrictions on dealer autonomy. The net impact of these regulations is that major OEMs cannot sell under existing brands except through their dealer networks and even new entrants face limitations on their ability to sell direct-to-consumer. We believe these elements create a robust and protective moat around our business. 94 ----- _Source: National Conference of State Legislatures as of June 2022._",N/A,as_expected,2023,340
990_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,212,BUSINESS,212.2,Industry Overview,212.2.3,Vehicle Electrification and Future of the Dealer,"We expect the automotive market to continue its long-term transition to EVs and expect OEMs to continue to sell EVs through dealers as the economics and regulatory limitations have mostly not changed with the advent of newer technologies. We believe this transition will also reinforce the growing importance of large auto dealers. We believe CDK, with our focus and leadership in the large auto dealer segment, is well positioned to capitalize on and benefit from this shift. Given the inertia that exists in the car parc, we expect the shift to EVs to be a gradual but sustaining transition. Incumbent OEMs – whose dealership’s represent CDK’s core customer base – are also expected to account for the majority of EV sales in the future. New EV only OEMs are expected to make up for only approximately 5% of total light vehicle sales in 2030, with incumbent OEMs making up the remaining 95%. Dealerships will require substantial investment throughout this transition, including building out showrooms and charging infrastructure and training their salesforce and technicians. We believe this required investment will serve as a catalyst to further accelerate the consolidation trends within the industry, with the larger, better capitalized dealers gaining share. As CDK is primarily focused on the largest and most sophisticated dealerships, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from this trend. Increasing penetration of EVs is also expected to improve the profit pools of larger dealerships. While EVs include fewer serviceable parts than ICE cars, the total value of parts for an EV is on average approximately two times more expensive than ICE cars due to the electrification systems, and more complex servicing requirements and tooling investment are expected to result in dealers retaining a greater share of servicing from less equipped third-party providers. Higher warranty provisions provided by OEMs on EVs are expected to result in greater revenue for dealers providing the service. The OEM and dealer relationship landscape is also evolving. In the current landscape, OEMs have limited control over pricing and there is a lack of seamless omnichannel experience due to limited OEM-to-dealer connectivity and inconsistent practices among dealers. New entrants (both OEMs and online retailers) have created stronger customer experiences, which is forcing OEMs and dealers to compete. As the evolution continues, we expect OEMs to demand a consistent branded experience (including product information and centrally managed pricing) and dealers will need to scale to provide a superior guest experience for new and used car buying and ownership. This will necessitate close collaboration between the OEM and dealers. We believe dealer consolidation will continue to accelerate and bolster the dealership importance to OEMs – both parties will focus on providing an omnichannel digital retail sales experience, leading to more efficient inventory and costs management. 95 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

The Issuer’s existing or future Foreign Subsidiaries and FSHCO Subsidiaries, any future Receivables Subsidiaries and other Excluded Subsidiaries are not expected to guarantee the Notes. The Guarantors will jointly and severally guarantee, fully and unconditionally, on a senior secured basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuers under the Indenture and the Notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes or expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Indenture by executing the Indenture or a supplement thereto. As further described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries,” in the future, certain additional domestic Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that guarantee certain Indebtedness of either Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor will guarantee the Notes, subject to certain exceptions and subject to release and discharge as described in this “Description of Notes.” Each of the Guarantees will be: - a general, secured senior obligation of the applicable Guarantor; - equal in right of payment with any existing and future Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor; - senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee; - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of Preferred Stock and other liabilities of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes (other than a CoIssuer); and - subordinated to obligations prescribed by statute, such as tax, social security and labor. In addition, the Guarantees will have the benefit of a security interest in the Collateral that will be (i) pari passu in priority with the security interest in the Collateral that secures obligations under the other existing and future First Lien Obligations, (ii) senior in priority to any security interest in the Collateral that secures obligations under any future Junior Lien Obligations and (iii) effectively senior in priority to all existing and future unsecured obligations to the extent of the value of the Collateral, in each case, subject to Permitted Liens and exceptions described under the caption “—Security for the Notes.” As of March 31, 2023, after giving effect to the offering of the Notes and the use of the net proceeds therefrom, together with cash on hand, to repay all of our outstanding borrowings under the Second Lien Credit Facility: - the Issuers and the Guarantors would have had $5,170.4 million in long-term indebtedness outstanding, $5,096.0 million of which would have been pari passu senior secured indebtedness outstanding under the First Lien Credit Facilities, and $74.4 million of which would have been unsecured indebtedness that is subordinated to the Notes to the extent of the value of the Collateral; and - the Issuers would have had availability to incur additional secured indebtedness of $650.0 million under the revolving credit facility under the First Lien Credit Facilities, subject to satisfaction of customary borrowing conditions. Unless designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries in accordance with the Indenture, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries.” Under certain circumstances, the Issuer will be permitted to designate certain of the Issuer’s existing and future subsidiaries (other than a Co-Issuer) as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Any Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes. 115 ----- As of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, before intercompany eliminations, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 4.9% and 4.9% of our Adjusted Revenue, 7.1% and 8.6% of our Further Adjusted EBITDA and less than 1% and less than 1% of our total assets (excluding cash), respectively. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding of any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries, such non-guarantor subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade and other creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuers or a Guarantor. As a result, all of the existing and future liabilities of the non-guarantor subsidiaries, including any claims of trade creditors, will be structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees. The Indenture does not limit the amount of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness and that may be incurred by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, including the non-guarantor subsidiaries. Holdings and each Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Co-Issuers) that guarantees the obligations of the Borrowers under the First Lien Credit Facilities will guarantee the Notes. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law. This provision may not, however, be effective (as a legal matter or otherwise) to protect a Guarantee from being voided under applicable fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce the applicable Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. If a Guarantee or related security interest were avoided (in whole or in part), it could be canceled or subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of a Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. Any Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP, but such contribution shall be subordinated in a customary manner to the payment in full of the obligations under the Indenture and the Notes. Each Guarantor may consolidate with, amalgamate or merge with or into or sell all or substantially all its assets to the Issuer, a Co-Issuer or another Guarantor without limitation or any other Person upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets—Subsidiary Guarantors.” Each Guarantee by a Guarantor will provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, any sale, exchange, issuance, disposition or transfer (by merger, amalgamation, consolidation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor, after which such Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case, if such sale, exchange, issuance, disposition or transfer is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture (including any amendments thereof); (2) the release or discharge of the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor of Indebtedness under the First Lien Credit Facilities, or the release or discharge of such other guarantee or direct obligation that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee or direct obligation (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement will constitute a release for the purposes of this provision, and that if any such Guarantee is so reinstated, such Guarantee shall also be reinstated to the extent that such Guarantor would then be required to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”); (3) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture or the occurrence of any event following which the Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture or becomes an Excluded Subsidiary; 116 ----- (4) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Issuer, any CoIssuer or another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (5) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event; (6) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” or in accordance with the provisions of any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement then in effect with respect to the Notes; (7) the exercise by the Issuers of their legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the discharge of the Issuers’ obligations under the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; or (8) in the case of Holdings, if Holdings ceases to be the direct parent of the Issuer as a result of a transaction or designation permitted pursuant to the Indenture, provided that, if any successor Parent Entity guarantees the obligations of the Borrower under the First Lien Credit Facilities, such Person assumes all of the obligations of Holdings under the Indenture and the applicable Notes Security Documents, in each case, pursuant to supplemental indentures or other applicable documents or instruments. Notwithstanding clause (5) above, if, after any Covenant Suspension Event, a Reversion Date shall occur, then the Suspension Period with respect to such Covenant Suspension Event shall terminate and all actions reasonably necessary to provide that the Notes shall have been unconditionally guaranteed by each Guarantor (to the extent such guarantee is required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”) shall be taken within 90 days after such Reversion Date or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, only the “Applicable Authorized Representative” or “Applicable Collateral Agent” have the right to act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral.

In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of First Lien Obligations permitted by the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such First Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the First Lien Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code), any reference to such First Lien Obligations or the Security Documents governing such First Lien Obligations will be deemed to refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified. None of the First Priority Secured Parties may institute in any bankruptcy case or other proceeding any claim against the Applicable Authorized Representative or any other First Priority Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared Collateral. None of the First Priority Secured Parties may challenge, or support any other Person in challenging, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding) the validity or enforceability of any First Lien Obligations of any Series or any first priority security document or the validity, attachment, perfection or priority of any Lien under any first priority security document or the validity or enforceability of the priorities, rights or duties established by or other provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. None of the First Priority Secured Parties may take or cause to be taken any action the purpose or intent of which is, or could be, to interfere, hinder or delay, in any manner, whether by judicial proceedings or otherwise, any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Shared Collateral by the Applicable Authorized Representative or Applicable Collateral Agent. In addition, none of the First Priority Secured Parties may seek to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Shared Collateral. If any First Priority Secured Party obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to any Security Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each of the First Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Priority Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Applicable Authorized Representative to be distributed in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of the other First Priority Collateral Agents for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the notes and each other Series of First Priority Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged upon conclusion of the applicable foreclosure proceeding or other exercise of remedies. However, any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom will be applied as described in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement also provides that if the Issuer, any Co-Issuer or any Guarantor becomes subject to a bankruptcy case and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of debtor-in-possession financing to be provided by one or more lenders under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code (or any equivalent provision of any other applicable debtor relief law) and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the 128 ----- Bankruptcy Code (or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable debtor relief law), each First Priority Secured Party have agreed or will agree that it will not oppose and will raise no objection to any such financing or to any Liens on the Shared Collateral (including by joining or supporting any such objection by any other Person) securing the same and/or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless the Applicable Authorized Representative with respect to such Shared Collateral opposes or objects (or joins in any opposition or objection) to such debtor-in-possession financing or such debtor-in-possession financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such debtor-in-possession financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Priority Secured Parties constituting debtor-in-possession financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such debtor-in-possession financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the First Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as: (A) the First Priority Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the debtor-in-possession financing lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other First Priority Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Priority Secured Parties constituting debtor-in-possession financing liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the insolvency or liquidation proceedings; (B) the First Priority Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional or replacement collateral pledged to any First Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such debtor-in-possession financing and/or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the First Priority Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Priority Secured Parties constituting debtor-in-possession financing Liens) as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; (C) if any amount of such debtor-in-possession financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; and (D) if any First Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection with respect to the First Lien Obligations subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such debtor-in-possessions financing and/or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; _provided that the First Priority Secured Parties of each Series will have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to_ secure the debtor-in-possession financing over any collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First Priority Secured Parties of such Series or its or their representative that do not constitute Shared Collateral; and provided, further, that any First Priority Secured Parties receiving adequate protection will not object to any other First Priority Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First Priority Secured Parties in connection with a debtor-in-possession financing or use of cash collateral. The First Priority Secured Parties have acknowledged or will acknowledge that the First Lien Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the other documents governing the First Lien Obligations, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priority of claims and application of proceeds set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the First Priority Secured Parties of any Series. By its acceptance of notes, each Holder will be deemed to have consented to the terms of the Security Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and to have authorized and directed the Trustee and the Notes 129 ----- Collateral Agent to execute, deliver and perform each of the Security Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, to which it is a party, binding the Holders to the terms thereof. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement contains broad exculpatory provisions in favor of the Applicable Collateral Agent and Applicable Authorized Representative. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions for the protection of the Applicable Collateral Agent and Applicable Authorized Representative from the incurrence of certain liabilities and contains provisions for satisfactory indemnity and/or security for such liabilities (in the absence of which the Applicable Collateral Agent and Applicable Authorized Representative may be entitled to decline to take any action).",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

(g) any general intangible and any lease, sublease, license, occupancy agreement, permit or other agreement or any property or right subject thereto (including pursuant to a purchase money security interest, capital lease obligation or similar arrangement or, in the case of after-acquired property, pre-existing secured debt not incurred in anticipation of the acquisition by the Issuer, a Co-Issuer or a Guarantor of such property) permitted under the Indenture to the extent that a grant of a security interest therein would violate or invalidate such item or create a breach, default or right of termination in favor of or otherwise require consent thereunder from any other party thereto (other than the Issuer, any Co-Issuer or any Guarantor) after giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction or other similar applicable Requirement of Law, other than proceeds and receivables thereof, the assignment of which is expressly deemed effective under the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction or other similar applicable Requirement of Law notwithstanding such prohibition; (h) (i) any Equity Interests in excess of 65% of any first tier CFC or FSHCO Subsidiary, (b) any Equity Interests or other voting ownership interests in any Subsidiary that is not a first tier Subsidiary of the Issuer, a Co-Issuer or a Guarantor and (c) the Equity Interests of a Subsidiary (other than a Wholly Owned Subsidiary) the pledge of which would violate such Subsidiary’s organizational or joint venture documents that is binding on or relating to such Equity Interests after giving effect to the applicable antiassignment provisions in the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction;

(j) Permitted Receivables Financing Assets subject to (or otherwise sold, contributed, pledged, factored, transferred or otherwise disposed of in connection with) any Permitted Receivables Financing; 122 ----- (k) any Vehicle (other than to the extent a security interest therein can be perfected by filing an “all assets” Uniform Commercial Code financing statement or equivalent filing and without the requirement to list any VIN, serial or similar number or to file or revise any certificate of title of such Vehicle);

(m) cash and Cash Equivalents (other than cash and Cash Equivalents representing identifiable proceeds of other Collateral, a security interest in which can be perfected solely through the filing of an “all-assets” Uniform Commercial Code financing statement or equivalent filing), and any deposit, commodity or securities account (including any securities entitlement and any related asset) (except to the extent a security interest therein can be perfected solely through the filing of an “all-assets” Uniform Commercial Code financing statement or equivalent filing or automatically without a filing); (n) Rule 3-16 Capital Stock; (o) Excluded Accounts; (q) any other assets to the extent that the Issuer determines in good faith that the cost, burden, difficulty or consequence of obtaining or perfecting a security interest in such assets is excessive in relation to the benefit to the holders of the Notes of the security to be afforded thereby or the value of such assets as Collateral; and (r) any other assets that do not secure the First Lien Credit Facilities, including, for the avoidance of doubt, if the First Lien Credit Facilities shall become unsecured credit facilities (including pursuant to any modification, refinancing or replacement thereof). The security interests in certain of the Collateral securing the Notes Obligations for the benefit of the Holders of Notes may not be in place on the Issue Date. To the extent any liens on or security interests in, the Collateral securing the Notes Obligations are not granted and/or perfected on or prior to the Issue Date, the Indenture will require us to use our commercially reasonable efforts to have all such security interests perfected, to the extent required by the Indenture and the Notes Security Documents, within a period of time specified in the Indenture and Notes Security Documents, such period of time not to be less than 120 days after the Issue Date. No assurance can be given, however, that such security interest to be delivered after the Issue Date will be granted or perfected on a timely basis. In addition, the security documents will generally not require the Issuers and the Guarantors to take certain actions to perfect the liens in certain of the Collateral, including, prior to the repayment in full of the obligations under the First Lien Credit Facilities, if such actions are not requested by the First Lien Credit Facilities Administrative Agent with respect to such Collateral. As a result, the liens may not attach or be perfected in certain of the Collateral, which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of the Notes with respect to such Collateral. In addition, Liens required to be granted from time to time pursuant to the Indenture shall be subject to exceptions and limitations set forth in the Notes Security Documents, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement described below and other applicable intercreditor agreements and consistent with the First Lien Credit Facilities, including that: (i) the Indenture and Notes Security Documents shall not require the creation or perfection of pledges of, or security interests in, or the obtaining of title insurance, legal opinions or other deliverables with respect to, particular assets of the Issuers or Guarantors (x) if, and for so long as and to the extent that the Issuers in good faith determine that the cost, burden or consequence of creating or perfecting such pledges or security interests in such assets, or obtaining such title insurance, legal opinions or other deliverables in respect of such assets (taking into account any non-de minimis adverse Tax consequences (including the imposition of non-de minimis withholding or other Taxes) and any non-de minimis adverse regulatory consequences, in each case to Holdings or its Subsidiaries or any Parent Entities, Affiliates or direct or indirect equity owners thereof), outweighs the benefits to be obtained by the holders of the Notes therefrom and/or (y) if the grant or perfection of a security interest in such asset would (A) be prohibited by enforceable anti-assignment provisions of any applicable Requirement of Law, (B) violate the terms 123 ----- of any contract (to the extent binding on such property at the time of the acquisition thereof and not incurred in contemplation of such acquisition) (in each case, after giving effect to the applicable antiassignment provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable Requirement of Law) or (C) trigger termination of any contract pursuant to any “change of control” or similar provision (to the extent binding on such property at the time of the acquisition thereof and not incurred in contemplation of such acquisition); it being understood that the Collateral shall include any proceeds and/or receivables (other than to the extent constituting Excluded Assets) arising out of any contract described in this clause (y) to the extent the assignment of such proceeds or receivables is expressly deemed effective under the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable Requirement of Law notwithstanding the relevant prohibition, violation or termination right; (ii) control agreements or other control or similar arrangements shall not be required with respect to cash, Cash Equivalents, deposit accounts, securities accounts, commodities accounts or other assets requiring perfection by control agreements; (iii) entry into any source code escrow arrangements or the registration of any intellectual property shall not be required; (iv) except with respect to a Designated Guarantor that is a Foreign Subsidiary (if any), no perfection actions shall be required, nor shall the Notes Collateral Agent be authorized to take any perfection or other actions, other than (x) filings pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code in the office of the secretary of state (or similar central filing office) of the relevant state(s), (y) filings in the United States Copyright Office or the United States Patent and Trademark Office with respect to intellectual property and (z) subject to the Intercreditor Agreements, delivery to the Notes Collateral Agent to be held in its possession of all Collateral consisting of certificated Equity Interests and other instruments, in each case to the extent not constituting Excluded Assets and to the extent required to be delivered pursuant to the applicable Security Documents; (v) except, in each case, with respect to a Designated Guarantor that is Foreign Subsidiary (if any), no actions in any jurisdiction other than the United States, a state thereof or the District of Columbia, or required by the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States, a state thereof or the District of Columbia, shall be required to be taken, nor shall the Notes Collateral Agent be authorized to take any such action, to create any security interests in assets located or titled outside of the United States, a state thereof or the District of Columbia (including any Equity Interests of Subsidiaries organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States, a state thereof or the District of Columbia and any Excluded Foreign Intellectual Property) or to perfect or make enforceable any security interests in any such assets (it being understood that there shall be no security agreements or pledge agreements governed under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States, a state thereof or the District of Columbia and all guarantee agreements shall be governed under the laws of the State of New York); and (vi) no Issuers or Guarantor shall be required to seek any landlord lien waiver, estoppel, warehouseman waiver or other collateral access or similar letter or agreement. Any periods of time for the taking of any action with respect to the granting of security interests with respect to the Notes shall be deemed extended to the extent the same period is extended in respect of the First Lien Credit Facilities or by a person that becomes Applicable Collateral Agent as described under “First Lien Intercreditor Agreement—Exercise of Remedies.” In no event shall the Issuers or the Guarantors be required to take any action with respect to the Notes if the same shall not be required and taken in respect of the First Lien Credit Facilities (so long as outstanding). The security interest securing the Notes Obligations will be pari passu in priority with any and all security interests in the Collateral securing the First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations, the Existing First Lien Notes Obligations and any Additional First Lien Obligations, and will be senior in priority with any and all security interests in the Collateral securing the Junior Lien Obligations, subject to all other Permitted Liens. The First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations, the Existing First Lien Notes Obligations and any Additional First Lien Obligations may include obligations in respect of Cash Management Services and related obligations, as well as certain hedging obligations. The person holding such First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations, Existing First Lien Notes Obligations 124 ----- or Additional First Lien Obligations may have rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such Liens that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral for the benefit of the Holders and the other Notes Secured Parties. Pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, in connection with any enforcement action with respect to the Collateral or any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, all proceeds of Collateral (after paying the fees and expenses of the applicable agents and any expenses of selling or otherwise foreclosing on the Collateral) will be applied pro rata to the repayment of the Notes Obligations, the First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations, the Existing First Lien Notes Obligations and the other outstanding First Lien Obligations. The Issuers and the Guarantors will be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future which could share in the Collateral, including Additional First Lien Obligations, Junior Lien Obligations, indebtedness secured by a Permitted Lien such as purchase money liens that may be prior to the Liens securing the Notes Obligations and additional indebtedness which may be secured on a junior priority basis to the Notes Obligations. The Indenture and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement provide that the Notes Collateral Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Notes Obligations, and without the consent of the Notes Secured Parties, shall be authorized to enter into one or more Acceptable Intercreditor Agreements with the holders of any such junior priority indebtedness. Although not all holders of Notes Obligations will be party to such intercreditor agreements, by their acceptance of the Notes, each agrees to be bound thereby. The amount of such other First Lien Obligations will be limited by the covenant disclosed under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”, and the amount of all such additional indebtedness will be limited by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.” Under certain circumstances the amount of such First Lien Obligations and additional indebtedness could be significant.",N/A,as_expected,2023,340
990_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,20,CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS,20.18,Repurchase at the Option of Holders,20.18.1,Change of Control,"The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Issuers have previously or concurrently sent a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuers will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash (the “Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the purchase date. Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Issuers will send (or cause to be sent) notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Change of Control,” and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuers; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below; (3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; 131 ----- (4) that unless the Issuers default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC to the Paying Agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered. The unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to at least $2,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof in relation to the Notes; (7) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control and shall describe each such condition, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or that such repurchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed, or such notice or offer may be rescinded at any time in the Issuers’ sole discretion if the Issuers determine that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived; (8) any other instructions, as determined by the Issuers, consistent with this Change of Control covenant, that a Holder must follow; and (9) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuers to purchase such Notes; provided that the applicable Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the tenth Business Day prior to the expiration date of the Change of Control Offer, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes, or a specified portion thereof, and its election to have such Notes purchased. While the Notes are in global form and the Issuers make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes or withdraw such election through the facilities of DTC, subject to its applicable rules and regulations. The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law: (1) accept for payment all Notes issued by them or portions thereof validly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the applicable Paying Agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered and not validly withdrawn; and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted, together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuers. 132 ----- The First Lien Credit Facilities provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuers (or one of their Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuers would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Indenture). In addition, the indenture governing the Existing First Lien Notes contain a change of control provision similar to the provisions described in this section. If the Issuer or a Co-Issuer experiences a change of control event that triggers a default under the First Lien Credit Facilities or any such future Indebtedness, the Issuers could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the First Lien Credit Facilities and/or such future Indebtedness. In the event the Issuers do not obtain such a waiver or do not refinance the First Lien Credit Facilities and/or such future Indebtedness, such default or failure to repurchase any tendered Notes could result in amounts outstanding under the First Lien Credit Facilities and/or such future Indebtedness being declared due and payable and/or cause Permitted Receivables Financings or other financing arrangements to be wound down. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “— Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and, in the case of Secured Indebtedness, “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control, the Issuers (or any Affiliate of the Issuers) have made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has purchased all Notes properly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Alternate Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer. A Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes and/or Guarantees (but the Change of Control Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of “Change of Control,” may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

(iii) Obligations under any Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case of Senior Indebtedness that consists of revolving obligations (other than Obligations in respect of any asset-based credit facility), to correspondingly reduce any outstanding commitments with respect thereto); provided that if the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall so reduce any Senior Indebtedness, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will either (A) reduce Obligations under the Notes on a pro rata basis by, at its option, (x) redeeming Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or (y) purchasing Notes through open-market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices (which may be below par), or (B) make an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes on a ratable basis with such other Senior Indebtedness for no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, thereon up to the principal amount of Notes to be repurchased; (iv) Obligations of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Co-Issuer or a Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, and, in the case of revolving obligations (other than Obligations in respect of any asset-based credit facility), to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto;

provided further that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that the application of any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale by the Issuer or a Foreign Subsidiary giving rise to a prepayment pursuant to this covenant (or at any time during the applicable investment period described herein) (a “Foreign Disposition”) is (x) prohibited or delayed by or would violate or conflict with applicable law from being repatriated to the United States or (y) would conflict with the fiduciary duties of such Foreign Subsidiary’s directors, or result in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any Company Person of such Foreign Subsidiary (including on account of financial assistance, corporate benefit, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar considerations), then, in each such case, an amount equal to the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied to reduce Indebtedness in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the Issuer or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary, and if such repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable law and, to the extent applicable, would no longer conflict with the fiduciary duties of such Company Person or result in, or be reasonably expected to result in, a material risk of personal or criminal liability for such Company Person, in either case, within 365 days following such Foreign Disposition, the relevant Foreign Subsidiary will promptly repatriate the relevant Net Proceeds and such repatriated Net Proceeds will be promptly applied (net of additional taxes, costs or expenses that would be payable or reserved against as a result thereof, in each case by the Issuer, any Co-Issuer or any Guarantor, any Subsidiary of the Issuer, such Co-Issuer or such Guarantor and any Affiliates or direct or indirect equity owners of the foregoing) in compliance with this covenant, (ii) to the extent that and for so long as the Issuer has determined in good faith that repatriation of any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Foreign Disposition would have an adverse accounting consequence or an adverse tax or cost consequence (other than any consequence that would be immaterial to the amount being repatriated) to the Issuer or its Subsidiaries or any Parent Entities, Affiliates or direct or indirect equity owners thereof (taking into account any foreign tax credit or benefit actually realized in connection with such repatriation in the year of such repatriation), including any withholding tax, with respect to such Net Proceeds if such amount were repatriated as a dividend, the Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied to reduce Indebtedness in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary; provided that if the Issuer determines in good faith, within 365 days of such Foreign Disposition, that the repatriation of any or all the Net Proceeds of such Foreign Disposition would no longer have such an adverse accounting consequence or an adverse Tax or cost consequence (other than any consequence that would be immaterial to the amount being repatriated) to the Issuer or its Subsidiaries or any Parent Entities, Affiliates or direct or indirect equity owners thereof (taking into account any foreign tax credit or benefit actually realized in connection with such repatriation in the year of such repatriation), including any withholding tax, with respect to such Net Proceeds if such amount were repatriated as a dividend, the relevant Foreign Subsidiary will promptly repatriate the relevant Net Proceeds and such repatriated Net Proceeds shall be promptly applied (net of additional taxes, costs or expenses that would be payable or reserved against as a result thereof, in each case by the Issuer, any Co-Issuer or any Guarantor, any Subsidiary of the Issuer, such Co-Issuer or such Guarantor and any Affiliates or direct or indirect equity owners of the foregoing) in compliance with this covenant and (iii) in connection with any prepayment attributable to any Joint Venture, to the extent that repatriation of any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Foreign Disposition of a Foreign Subsidiary giving rise to a prepayment pursuant to this covenant (or at any time during the applicable investment period described herein), violate any applicable organizational documents or any agreement of any Joint Venture (or any relevant shareholders’ agreement or similar agreement), in each case if the 136 ----- amount subject to the relevant prepayment were upstreamed or transferred as a distribution or dividend, the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied to reduce Indebtedness and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary; provided that if repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable documents within 365 days of such Foreign Disposition, the relevant Foreign Subsidiary will promptly repatriate the relevant Net Proceeds and such repatriated Net Proceeds will be promptly applied (net of additional taxes, costs or expenses that would be payable or reserved against as a result thereof, in each case by the Issuer, any Co-Issuer or any Guarantor, any Subsidiary of the Issuer, such Co-Issuer or such Guarantor and any Affiliates or direct or indirect equity owners of the foregoing) in compliance with this covenant. Any of the foregoing prohibitions, violations, legal liability events, fiduciary duty or similar considerations, capitalization requirements and/or tax costs or consequences, are referred to collectively as “Payment Deferral Events.” The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of any of the foregoing Payment Deferral Events will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Indenture shall be construed to require either Issuer or any Subsidiary to repatriate cash. Any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale of Collateral (other than Retained Asset Sale Proceeds and any amounts excluded from this covenant as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph) that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the second preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”; provided that any amount of Net Proceeds offered to Holders of the Notes pursuant to clause (1)(b)(iii) of the second preceding paragraph shall not be deemed to be Excess Proceeds without regard to whether such offer is accepted by any Holders. When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds (i) with respect to any single transaction or series of related transactions, the greater of (x) $92.6 million and (y) 10.0% of LTM EBITDA individually or (ii) with respect to all other such dispositions, the greater of (x) $324.1 million and (y) 35.0% of LTM EBITDA in the aggregate in any fiscal year (the “Excess Proceeds Threshold”), the Issuers shall make an offer (a “Asset Sale Offer”) to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any other First Lien Obligations or Obligations secured by a Lien permitted under the Indenture on the Collateral disposed of (which Lien is not subordinate to the Lien of the Notes with respect to the Collateral), to the holders of such other First Lien Obligations or other Obligations, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such other First Lien Obligations or other Obligations that is, with respect to the Notes only, in an amount equal to $2,000, or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value thereof, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, and in the case of such other First Lien Obligations or other Obligations, at the offer price required by the terms thereof, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the agreement(s) governing such other First Lien Obligations or other Obligations. The Issuers will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within 20 Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed the Excess Proceeds Threshold by delivering to the Holders the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuers may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net Proceeds prior to the time period that may be required by the Indenture with respect to all or a part of the available Net Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”). To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and such other First Lien Obligations or Obligations secured by a Lien permitted under the Indenture on the Collateral disposed of, as the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the amount offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuers may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) (“Declined Proceeds”) for any purposes not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and such other First Lien Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuers shall purchase the Notes (subject to applicable DTC procedures as to global notes) and such other First Lien Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes and such other First Lien Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or such other First Lien Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) that 137 ----- resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Sale Offer shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds (or Advance Portion) upon such completion). Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), any remaining Net Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuers may use such Net Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. An Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes, Notes Security Documents and/or Guarantees (but the Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). Pending the final application of the amount of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness, or otherwise use such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to a Collateral Asset Sale Offer, an Asset Sale Offer, a Collateral Advance Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes. The First Lien Credit Facilities contain, and future credit agreements or other similar agreements to which the Issuers become a party may contain, restrictions on the Issuers’ ability to repurchase Notes. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuers are prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Issuers could seek the consent of their lenders to the repurchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuers do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuers will remain prohibited from repurchasing the Notes. In such a case, the Issuers’ failure to repurchase tendered Notes would constitute a Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such other agreements.",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this “Description of Notes” as the “Suspension Period.” The Guarantees of the Subsidiary Guarantors will be suspended during the Suspension Period.

DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the ----- Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it: (1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and (2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes). Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants in DTC. All interests in the Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Investors in the Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank N.A., as operator of Clearstream which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Interests in a Global Note held through Euroclear or Clearstream may be subject to the procedures and requirements of those systems (as well as to the procedures and requirements of such systems). The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own and the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to Persons that are subject to those requirements will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing those interests. Except as described below, beneficial owners of an interest in the Global Notes will not have notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of notes in registered certificated form (“Certificated Notes”) and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the indenture that will govern the Notes for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of and premium and interest on a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the indenture that will govern the Notes. Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the Notes, the Issuers and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuers, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuers or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the Notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount 236 ----- of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of the Notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuers. None of the Issuers nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of any the Notes, and the Issuers and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests of the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Note as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its Participants. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between Participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described herein, cross-market transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by its respective depositary, however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which that Participant or those Participants has or have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended Notes in certificated form, and to distribute those Notes to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in Global Notes among Participants, they are under no obligation to perform those procedures, and may discontinue or change those procedures at any time. None of the Issuers nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective Participants or Indirect Participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect the changes in the principal amounts of the Regulation S Global Note and the Rule 144A Global Note, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in another Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interest in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest.

We intend to take the position that the possibility that any such payments will be made does not cause the Notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. Our position is binding on you unless you disclose a contrary position in the manner required by the applicable Treasury regulations. Our position is not binding, however, on the IRS. If the IRS were to take a contrary position, a holder of Notes may be required to accrue interest income on the Notes based upon a “comparable yield,” as defined in the Treasury Regulations, determined at the time of issuance of the Notes (which yield is not expected to differ significantly from the actual yield on the Notes), with adjustments to such accruals when any contingent payments are made that differ from the payments based on the comparable yield. In addition, any income on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes would be treated as interest income rather than as capital gain. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the tax consequences if the Notes are treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including, but not limited to, the requirement of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the ERISA Plan. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan (as well as those plans, accounts or arrangements that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts and entities that are deemed to hold the assets of such plans, accounts or arrangements (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”)) with certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” under ERISA or “disqualified persons” under the Code) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of a Plan that engages in such a nonexempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Any Plan fiduciary which proposes to cause a Plan to purchase or hold the Notes (or any interest therein) should consider the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA and the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code to such purchase or holding, and confirm that such purchase and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA or the Code. Non-U.S. plans, governmental plans and certain church plans (collectively, “Non-ERISA Arrangements”), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to non-U.S., state, local or other federal laws or regulations that are similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”). Fiduciaries of any Non-ERISA Arrangements subject to Similar Laws should consult with their counsel before purchasing or holding the Notes (or any interest therein) regarding the potential consequences of an investment in the Notes under any applicable Similar Laws and the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such Similar Laws.

This discussion does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances, including alternative minimum tax and Medicare contribution tax consequences, the application of Section 451(b) of the Code (as defined below) with respect to conforming the timing of income accruals to financial statements, as well as differing tax consequences that may apply if you are, for instance: - a financial institution; - a regulated investment company; - a real estate investment trust; - a dealer or trader in securities that uses a mark-to-market method of tax accounting; - a person holding Notes as part of a “straddle” or integrated transaction; - a U.S. Holder (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; - a U.S. expatriate; - a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for more than 182 days in a taxable year; - a tax-exempt entity; - a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or - a beneficial owner of a loan under our Second Lien Term Loan Facility. If you are a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of your partners will generally depend on the status of the partners and your activities.

See “Transfer Restrictions.” The Notes will initially be offered at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the initial purchasers. The initial purchasers reserve the right to reject an order of Notes in whole or in part. The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed that, for a period of 30 days after the date of this offering memorandum, we will not, directly or indirectly, take any of the following actions with respect to any United States dollar-denominated debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuers, the Guarantors or any of their respective subsidiaries and having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any of its securities (“Lock-Up Securities”): (i) offer, sell, issue, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of Lock-Up Securities, (ii) offer, sell, issue, contract to sell, contract to purchase or grant any option, right or warrant to purchase Lock-Up Securities, (iii) enter into any swap, hedge or any other agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, the economic consequences of ownership of Lock-Up Securities, (iv) establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position in Lock-Up Securities within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act or (v) file with the SEC a registration statement under the Securities Act relating to Lock-Up Securities or publicly disclose the intention to take any such action, without the prior written consent of the representative. The offer and sale of Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and the Notes may not be offered or sold except as set forth above. Prior to the offering, there has been no active market for the Notes. 249 ----- As a result, we cannot assure you that the initial prices at which the Notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the Notes will develop and continue after completion of this offering. We do not intend to apply for listing of the Notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the Notes on any automated dealer quotation system. The initial purchasers have advised us that they presently intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. The initial purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes and any such market making may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the initial purchasers. In addition, market-making activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the Exchange Act, and may be limited. The ability of the initial purchasers to make a market in the Notes may also be impacted by changes in any regulatory requirements (including as a result of regulatory developments such as the SEC’s interpretation of Rule 15c2-11 and its application to debt securities) applicable to the marketing, holding and trading of, and issuing quotations with respect to, the Notes. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Your ability to transfer the Notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and an active trading market may not be maintained for the Notes.” We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made to investors on or about    , 2023, which will be the business day following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement being referred to as “T+     “). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes hereunder more than two business days prior to the scheduled closing date for this offering will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially settle in T+ , to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes hereunder during such period should consult their advisors. In connection with sales outside the United States, the initial purchasers have agreed that they will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, United States persons (1) as part of their distribution at any time or (2) otherwise prior to 40 days after the closing of the offering.

Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. #### Basis for Review Results #### We conducted our review in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS) applicable to reviews of interim financial information. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. A review of interim financial information is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS, the objective of which is an expression of an opinion regarding the financial information as a whole, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our review. We believe that the results of the review procedures provide a reasonable basis for our conclusion. #### Responsibilities of Management for the Interim Financial Information #### Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the interim financial information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of interim financial information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Central Parent LLC (“Parent"" or the ""Company"") was formed as a corporation under the laws of the",216.18.1,,"state of Delaware on April 5, 2022 (the ""Inception Date""). Parent, along with Parent’s owner Central HoldCo LLC (“Holdings”), were created by affiliates of Brookfield Corporation. and Brookfield Capital Partners VI L.P. (together, “Brookfield”) to acquire CDK Global, Inc. (""CDK"") through Parent's subsidiary Central Merger Sub, Inc. (""Merger Sub""). On April 8, 2022, CDK entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Agreement”), dated as of April 7, 2022, with Parent and Merger Sub. Parent was formerly known as Central Parent Inc. The Company converted to a limited liability company on April 26, 2023 as part of a restructuring plan associated with the transfer of the recreation business assets to newly created legal entities under Central TopCo LLC (""TopCo"") which is the entity that owns Holdings. The restructuring also resulted in the conversion of TopCo and Holdings which were formerly known as Central TopCo Inc. and Central HoldCo Inc., respectively. Contemporaneous with the conversions of these legal entities their authorized and issued common stock was replaced with membership interests. See Note 17 Subsequent Events for additional information on this transaction. On July 6, 2022, Merger Sub completed its acquisition of CDK (the ""Acquisition"") and Merger Sub was subsequently merged into CDK on that same date with CDK becoming the surviving entity (the ""Merger"") and remaining a subsidiary of Parent. Parent was determined to be the surviving accounting acquirer (the ""Acquirer"") of CDK and accounted for the Acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting whereby assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Acquisition were recorded at their fair value on the date of the Acquisition. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Parent reflect CDK's results of operations and cash flows beginning July 6, 2022. Prior to July 6, 2022, Parent's only activities involved borrowing $750.0 million on June 16, 2022 and incurring interest expense on that debt, net of income tax benefit. See Note 10, Debt. All of Parent's business operations are conducted by its subsidiary CDK. CDK is a leading provider of cloud-based software to dealerships and Original Equipment Manufacturers (""OEMs"") across automotive and related industries. CDK’s cloud-based, software as a service (SaaS) platform enables dealerships to manage their end-to-end business operations including the acquisition, sale, financing, insuring, repair, and maintenance of vehicles. By automating and streamlining critical workflows, the integrated platform of modern solutions enables dealers to sell and service more vehicles by creating simple and convenient experiences for customers and improves their financial and operational performance.",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

The period following,216.19.1,,"the Acquisition depicts the consolidated financial results of Parent (""Successor"") while the period prior to the Acquisition depicts the financial statements of CDK (""Predecessor""). Since Parent's (Successor's) financial statements reflect a new basis of accounting based on the application of business combination accounting that resulted in the fair value of the consideration paid to acquire CDK being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Parent, the results of operations of the Successor and Predecessor periods are not comparable. Basis of Preparation.** The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP”) for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses that are reported in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. Interim financial results are not necessarily indicative of financial results for a full year. The accompanying unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements from inception date to December 31, 2022 (the “Annual Report”). Concurrent with the Acquisition, CDK's (Predecessor's) fiscal year end was changed from June 30 to December 31 to align with that of Parent.

ASU 2022-02 is effective for the Company at the beginning of its fiscal year that begins January 1, 2023 and interim periods within that fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted. Currently, the Company is not involved in a TDR, therefore the adoption of ASU 2022-02 is not expected to have any effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, ""Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 45-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations"" (""ASU 2022-04""). ASU 2022-04 amends disclosure guidance for a reporting entity that is a buyer of goods and services from a vendor and also enters into a supplier finance arrangement with a bank or other financial intermediary. The reporting entity must disclose information about the key terms of the finance arrangement, outstanding amounts as of the end of each reporting period, a description of where in the financial statements outstanding amounts are presented, and a rollforward of such amounts during each annual reporting period. The amendments in ASU 2022-04 are effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2023, including interim periods within 2023, except for the disclosure of rollforward information, which is effective for the Company's annual reporting beginning in 2024. Early adoption is permitted. With the exception of the amendment on disclosure of rollforward information, which entities only need to apply prospectively, entities must apply the amendments in ASU 2022-04 retrospectively by providing the required disclosures for each period for which a balance sheet is presented.

These lawsuits have been transferred to, or filed in, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois for consolidated and coordinated pretrial proceedings as part of a multidistrict litigation proceeding (""MDL""). - Teterboro Automall, Inc. d/b/a Teterboro Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram (""Teterboro"") brought a putative class action suit on behalf of itself and all similarly situated automobile dealerships against CDK and Reynolds. Teterboro has disclosed an expert who opined that the dealerships suffered direct and indirect damages of approximately $339 million. Teterboro’s suit was originally filed on October 19, 2017, in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. Since that time, several more putative class actions were filed in a number of federal district courts, with substantively similar allegations; all of them have been consolidated with the MDL proceeding. On June 4, 2018, a consolidated class action complaint was filed on behalf of a putative class made up of all dealerships in the United ----- g y y p y g y several subclasses of such dealers in certain states (""Putative Dealership Class Plaintiffs""). CDK moved to dismiss the complaint, or in the alternative, compel arbitration of certain Putative Dealership Class Plaintiffs’ claims while staying the remainder pending the outcome of those arbitration proceedings; its motion to dismiss was granted in part and denied in part, while its motion to compel arbitration was denied. On February 22, 2019, CDK filed an answer to the remaining claims in Putative Dealership Class Plaintiffs' complaint and asserted counterclaims against certain Putative Dealership Class Plaintiffs. The Putative Dealership Class Plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss CDK’s counterclaims; that motion was granted in part and denied in part on September 3, 2019. On October 23, 2018, the Putative Dealership Class Plaintiffs and Reynolds filed a motion for preliminary approval of settlement and for conditional certification of the proposed settlement class. The court finally approved that settlement on January 22, 2019. The parties' crossmotions for summary judgment and _Daubert motions were fully briefed as of September 28, 2020. On January 21, 2022 the court issued a memorandum opinion and order with respect to the Daubert motions, granting the motions in part and denying them in part. The court excluded the opinion disclosed by the Putative Dealership Class Plaintiffs’ expert that the Class suffered $339 million in direct damages, but held that the Class may continue to seek indirect damages under state laws that permit recovery of such damages. The parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment remain pending. - Loop LLC d/b/a AutoLoop (""AutoLoop"") brought suit against CDK on April 9, 2018, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, but purported to reserve its rights to seek a transfer to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin at the conclusion of the MDL proceedings. On June 5, 2018, AutoLoop amended its complaint to sue on behalf of itself and a putative class of all other automotive software vendors in the United States that purchased data integration services from CDK or Reynolds. Autoloop has disclosed an expert who opines that the proposed vendor class suffered direct damages totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, but the precise amount of the vendors’ damages claim has not been publicly disclosed. CDK moved to compel arbitration of AutoLoop's claims, or in the alternative, to dismiss those claims; that motion was denied on January 25, 2019. CDK filed an answer to AutoLoop’s complaint and asserted counterclaims against AutoLoop on February 15, 2019. AutoLoop filed an answer to CDK's counterclaims on March 8, 2019. The parties' cross-motions for summary judgment and _Daubert motions were fully briefed as of September 28, 2020. On January 21, 2022 the court issued a memorandum opinion and order with respect to the Daubert motions, granting the motions in part and denying in part. The parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment remain pending. CDK believes that the remaining unsettled cases are without merit and will continue to vigorously contest all asserted claims. Nonetheless, in light of CDK's settlements with Authenticom, i3 Brands, MVSC, and Cox and its continued expenditure of legal costs to contest the remaining claims, the Company has determined that a range of possible loss outcomes is probable and can be reasonably estimated. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the litigation liability for the remaining unsettled cases was $34.0 million and $34.0 million respectively. This estimated loss represents the low end of the range and is based upon currently available information and represents the Company's best estimate of such loss. Estimating the value of this range of loss involved significant judgment given the uncertainty that still exists with respect to the remaining unsettled cases due to a variety of factors typical of complex, large scale litigation, including, among others: (i) formative issues, including: (a) the causes of action the plaintiffs can pursue; (b) the definition of the class(es) of plaintiffs; (c) the types of damages that can be recovered; and (d) whether plaintiffs can establish loss causation as a matter of law, all of which have yet to be determined pending the outcome of dispositive motions (e.g., motions for class certification and motions for summary judgment); (ii) significant factual issues remain to be resolved; (iii) expert perspectives with respect to, among other things, alleged antitrust injury and damages is widely divergent and remains subject to dispositive motions; (iv) the absence of productive settlement discussions to date with the remaining plaintiffs; and (v) the novel or uncertain nature of the legal issues presented. In addition, the Company's estimate does not incorporate or reflect the potential value of the Company's counterclaims against certain of the plaintiffs in the ongoing cases. The legal proceedings underlying the estimated litigation liability will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from the estimate. As noted above, an adverse result in any of the remaining cases could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. On June 22, 2017, CDK received from the Federal Trade Commission (""FTC"") a Civil Investigative Demand consisting of specifications calling for the production of documents relating to any agreements between the CDK and Reynolds. Parallel document requests have been received from certain states' Attorneys General. Since 2017, CDK has engaged in continuing communication with and received subsequent requests from the FTC related to its investigation. CDK has responded to the requests and no proceedings have been instituted. CDK believes there has not been any conduct by CDK or its current or former employees that would be actionable under the antitrust laws in connection with the agreements between CDK and Reynolds or otherwise. At this time, the Company does not have sufficient information to predict the outcome of, or the cost of responding to or resolving, these investigations. ----- g**, p y y the Company makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Company’s services and products. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties. The Company has provided approximately $27.9 million of guarantees as of March 31, 2023 (Successor) in the form of surety bonds issued to support certain licenses and contracts which require a surety bond as a guarantee of performance of contractual obligations. In general, the Company would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event the Company defaulted in performing the obligations under each contract, of which, the probability is remote. The Company had a total of $1.7 million in letters of credit outstanding as of March 31, 2023 (Successor) primarily in connection with insurance programs. The Company entered into a 5-year contract with a third-party managed services provider which includes penalties in the event of termination for convenience. As of March 31, 2023 (Successor), the Company would be required to pay a $33.0 million fee to terminate the contract.",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

On April 30, 2023, following the formation of new legal entities and conversions of existing legal entities as part of a multi-step restructuring plan, subsidiaries of Parent contributed the net assets of its recreation business to newly formed entities under TopCo pursuant to a Contribution Agreement. The Recreation Business provides software solutions to retailers and manufacturers of motorcycles, boats and other marine and recreational vehicles. The net assets will be transferred from Parent at carrying value with a corresponding adjustment to additional-paid-in-capital. On a prospective basis, Parent’s consolidated financial statements will no longer include the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the recreation business. The transaction does not constitute a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company’s financial results and business activities and does not qualify for discontinued operations. Similarly, the transaction did not meet the held for sale criteria. This ----- g p y y gy offerings. Parent will provide limited services to the Recreation Business pursuant to various transition services and intercompany agreements but will not have continuing involvement in the management or operations of this business. The Recreation Business is considered held and used and therefore is not presented as held for sale.

Hoffman Estates, Illinois Opinion We have audited the consolidated financial statements of CDK Global, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 (successor), June 30, 2022 (predecessor) and June 30, 2021 (predecessor), and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the period from July 6, 2022 to December 31, 2022 (successor), the period from July 1, 2022 to July 5, 2022 (predecessor) and for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (predecessor), and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 (successor), June 30, 2022 (predecessor) and June 30, 2021 (predecessor), and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from July 6, 2022 to December 31, 2022 (successor), the period from July 1, 2022 to July 5, 2022 (predecessor) and for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (predecessor), in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our ----- #### opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we: • Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. • Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit. Other Information Included in the Annual Report Management is responsible for the other information included in the annual report. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information, and we do not express an opinion or any form of assurance thereon. In connection with our audits of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and consider whether a material inconsistency exists between the other information and the financial statements, or the other information otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work performed, we conclude that an uncorrected material misstatement of the other information exists, we are required to describe it in our report.

On April 8, 2022, CDK entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Agreement”), dated as of",216.68.1,,"April 7, 2022, with Central Parent Inc. (“Parent”) and Central Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), entities, along with Parent’s owner Central HoldCo Inc. (“Holdings”), that were created by affiliates of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and Brookfield Capital Partners VI L.P. (together, “Brookfield”) in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement. Pursuant to the Agreement, Merger Sub commenced a tender offer (“Tender Offer”) to acquire all of the then-outstanding shares of CDK’s common stock at a per share cash price of $54.87. Upon expiration of the Tender Offer on July 5, 2022, a majority of shares of CDK’s common stock were tendered under the Tender Offer and the remaining shares were purchased by Brookfield and its institutional partners pursuant to the terms of the Tender Offer and Agreement, resulting in the tender of all then-outstanding shares of CDK's common stock. Pursuant to the Agreement, on July 6, 2022 CDK issued 100 new shares of its common stock to Merger Sub and Parent as part of the consideration for CDK's net assets. Merger Sub then merged with and into CDK on that same date in a common control merger transaction, with CDK surviving the merger (the “Merger”) and becoming a subsidiary of Parent (see Note 5, _Business _Combinations and Common Control Merger). The “Acquisition” refers to the Merger Sub and CDK becoming a wholly owned and_ controlled subsidiary of Parent. Parent was determined to be the accounting acquirer and accounted for the Acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. CDK elected to apply pushdown accounting whereby the fair values, determined in accordance with GAAP, assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Parent from CDK were pushed down to the stand-alone financial statements of CDK. The periods prior to and including July 5, 2022 are referred to as the predecessor periods (“Predecessor”), and the periods subsequent to and including July 6, 2022 are referred to as the successor periods (“Successor”).

990_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,216,WHERE YOU CAN FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION,216.74,Revenue Recognition. The Company determines the amount of revenue to be recognized through the following steps:,216.74.1,"Subscription. CDK provides software and technology solutions for automotive retailers and OEMs, which includes:","- Dealer Management Systems (""DMSs"") and layered applications, which may be installed on-site at the customer’s location, or hosted and provided on a software-as-a-service (""SaaS"") basis, including ongoing maintenance and support; - Interrelated services such as installation, initial training, and data updates; and - Prior to adoption of ASC No. 842, ""Leases"" (""ASC 842""), subscription revenue included technology solutions in which hardware was provided on a service basis. This revenue was previously classified as subscription revenue because, under lease accounting guidance in effect prior to ASC 842, substitution rights were considered substantive. SaaS and other hosted service arrangements, which allow the customer continuous access to the software over the contract period without taking control of the software, are provided on a subscription basis. The Company has concluded that under its SaaS and hosted service arrangements, the customer obtains access to the Company’s software which resides and is maintained on its managed servers. The customer does not obtain the right to take possession of the software. As such, the Company has concluded that its SaaS and hosted services arrangements do not include a software license. Furthermore, the Company has concluded that while the support and maintenance and hosting services are capable of being distinct performance obligations, the obligations are not distinct within the context of the contract. In addition, as the support and maintenance and hosting services are provided over the same period and have the same pattern of transfer of control, the support and maintenance and hosting services are combined and recognized as a single performance obligation. The Company may provide new customers with interrelated setup activities such as installation, initial training and data updates that the Company must undertake to fulfill the contract. These are considered fulfillment activities that do not transfer service to the customer. In addition to the core DMS software application, the customer may also contract for layered applications, which are each considered a distinct performance obligation. Revenue for SaaS and other hosted service arrangements, are recognized ratably over the duration of the contract. The Company has determined its obligation under these arrangements is to stand ready to perform the underlying services as required by the customer. The customer receives the benefit of the services, and the Company has the right to payment as the services are performed. A timeelapsed output method is used to measure progress as the Company transfers control evenly over the duration of the contract. Transaction._** The Company receives fees per transaction for providing auto retailers interfaces with third parties to process credit reports, vehicle registrations, and automotive equity mining. Transaction revenue varies based on the volume of transactions processed. For transaction revenue, the Company has a right to payment as the transactions are performed in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer. As such, the Company recognizes transaction revenue as the services are rendered and in the amount to which it has the right to invoice. Transaction revenue for credit report processing and automotive equity mining is recorded in revenue on a gross basis, incurred when the Company is substantively and contractually responsible for providing the service, software, and/or connectivity to the customer, and controls the specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer. The Company recognizes vehicle registration revenue net of the state registration fee since it is acting as an agent and does not control the related goods and services before they are transferred to the customer. Other._** The Company provides consulting and professional services, including marketing campaign solutions, and sells hardware such as laser printers, networking and telephony equipment, and related items. Consulting and professional services are either billed on a time and materials basis or on a fixed monthly, quarterly or semi-annual basis based on the amount of services contracted. Revenue from these services is recorded when the Company’s obligation is satisfied. Where the Company’s obligation is to provide continuous services throughout the contract period and the customer receives the benefit of those services as they are performed, the Company recognizes services revenue over time using a time-elapsed output method as the Company believes the passage of time faithfully depicts the transfer of services to its customers. Where the professional service represents a single performance obligation, the customer receives the benefit of the services only upon their completion, and the Company does not have the right to payment as the services are performed, such services revenue is recognized upon completion. The Company often sells hardware bundled with maintenance services and has concluded that these bundles include two distinct performance obligations. The first performance obligation is to transfer the hardware product and the second performance obligation is to provide maintenance on the hardware and its embedded software. As such, the transaction price allocated to the sold hardware is recognized upon delivery at which point the customer is able to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the hardware. Upon delivery of the hardware, the Company generally has the right to payment, the customer has legal title, physical possession of, and control of the hardware. The transaction price allocated to the maintenance of hardware and its embedded software is recognized ratably over the duration of the contract as the customer simultaneously consumes and receives the benefit of this maintenance. The Company has determined its obligation under these arrangements is to stand ready to perform ----- transfers control evenly over the duration of the contract. Hardware maintenance is included in subscription revenue. After the adoption of ASC 842, Other revenue also includes leasing revenue from hardware where the customer has a right of use during the contract term under ASC 842, as hardware substitution rights are not considered substantive. Also included in the Other category are on-site software arrangements which include a license of intellectual property as the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software and the customer can either run the software on its own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to the Company to host the software. The customer receives the right to use the software license upon its installation for the term of the arrangement. As such, the Company has concluded that the software license is a distinct performance obligation and recognizes the transaction price allocated to on-site software upon installation. The Company also provides maintenance and support of the software applications. Such maintenance and support services may include server and desktop support, bug fixes, and support resolving other issues a customer may encounter in utilizing the software. Revenue allocated to maintenance and support is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given the support and maintenance comprise distinct performance obligations that are satisfied ratably over time. A time-elapsed output method is used to measure progress as the Company transfers control evenly over the duration of the contract. Accordingly, maintenance and support revenue for on-site licenses is included in subscription revenue.",N/A,as_expected,2023,340
990_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,216,WHERE YOU CAN FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION,216.74,Revenue Recognition. The Company determines the amount of revenue to be recognized through the following steps:,216.74.2,,"- Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; - Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; - Determination of the transaction price; - Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and - Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies the performance obligations. The majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from contracts with multiple performance obligations. A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account in Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") No. 606, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" (""ASC 606""). A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The Company is required to estimate the total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers. In limited circumstances, the consideration expected to be received may be variable based on the specific terms of the contract. The Company rarely licenses or sells products or services on a standalone basis. As such, the Company is required to develop its best estimate of standalone selling price of each distinct good or service as the basis for allocating the total transaction price. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the adjusted market assessment approach, with some product categories using the expected cost plus a margin approach. When establishing standalone selling price, the Company considers various factors which may include geographic region, current market trends, customer class, its market share and position, its general pricing practices for bundled products and services, and recent contract sales data. The Company applies significant judgment in order to identify and determine the number of performance obligations, estimate the total transaction price, determine the allocation of the transaction price to each identified performance obligation, and determine the appropriate method and timing of revenue recognition. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis; that is, such taxes are excluded from revenue. ----- evaluate a contract for a significant financing component if payment is expected within one year from the transfer of the promised items to the customer.",N/A,as_expected,2023,340
990_3,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,216,WHERE YOU CAN FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION,216.75,Income Taxes. Income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. Deferred tax,216.75.1,,"assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments, and estimates to determine the provision for income taxes, taxes payable or refundable, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company's assumptions, judgments, and estimates take into consideration the realization of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. The Company's income tax returns are subject to examination by various tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event the Company determines that it is more likely than not that an entity will be unable to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, the Company would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which such a determination is made. Likewise, if the Company later determines that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, the Company would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance. In order to realize deferred tax assets, the Company must be able to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located. The Company recognizes tax benefits for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits are tax benefits claimed in the Company's income tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards. Assumptions, judgments, and the use of estimates are required in determining whether the ""more likely than not"" standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes. If certain pending tax matters settle within one year, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. The Company continually assesses the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjusts the income tax provision, the current taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. ----- stock options to purchase shares of the Company’s (Predecessor) common stock and/or (b) restricted stock or restricted stock units under which shares of the Company's (Predecessor) common stock vested based on the passage of time or achievement of performance and market conditions. See Note 7, Stock-Based Compensation (Predecessor). The Company (Predecessor) recognized stock-based compensation expense in earnings based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant. The Company (Predecessor) recorded the impact of forfeitures on stock compensation expense in the period the forfeitures occurred. The Company (Predecessor) determined the fair value of stock options issued using a binomial option-pricing model. The binomial option-pricing model considered a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatility utilized in the binomial option pricing model was based on a combination of implied market volatility and historical volatility of peer companies. Similarly, the dividend yield was based on historical experience and expected future dividend payments. The risk-free rate was derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option pricing model also incorporated exercises based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of a stock option grant was derived from the output of the binomial model and represented the period of time that options granted were expected to be outstanding. The grant date fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested upon achievement of service conditions was based on the closing price of the Company's (Predecessor) common stock on the date of grant. The Company (Predecessor) also granted performance-based awards that vested over a performance period. Certain performance-based awards were further subject to adjustment (increase or decrease) based on a market condition defined as total stockholder return of the Company’s (Predecessor) common stock compared to a peer group of companies. The fair value of performance-based awards subject to a market condition was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The principal variable assumptions utilized in determining the grant date fair value of performance-based awards subject to a market condition included the risk-free rate, stock volatility, dividend yield, and correlations between the Company's stock price and the stock prices of the peer group of companies. The probability associated with the achievement of performance conditions affected the vesting of the Company's (Predecessor) performance-based awards. Expense was only recognized for those shares that were expected to vest. The Company (Predecessor) adjusted stock-based compensation expense (increase or decrease) when it became probable that actual performance would differ from the estimate.",N/A,as_expected,2023,340

The Company’s receivables also include the short and long-term portions of contract assets, lease receivables and other accrued and unbilled receivables. Refer to Note 6, _Revenue, for more information about contract assets._ After the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") No. 2016-13, ""Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326)"" (""ASU 2016-13""), which requires the application of a current expected credit loss impairment model (""CECL""), the Company identified the following risk characteristics of its customers and the related receivables and financial assets: geographic region, major line of business (e.g. Automotive, OEM, etc.), size or a combination of these characteristics. Receivables with similar risk characteristics have been grouped into pools. For each pool, the Company considers the historical credit loss experience, current economic conditions, adjusted for external data and macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates in certain operating regions or automobile sales. Due to the short-term nature of trade receivables, the estimated amount of accounts receivable that may not be collected is based on the aging of the receivable balances, the financial condition of customers and the Company’s historical loss rates. For certain other financial assets, the expected credit losses are also evaluated based on the credit rating of the counterparty, or reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Additionally, specific reserves are established for certain financial assets on an individual basis when they no longer meet the criteria to be classified in a particular pool. Should a particular asset’s risk characteristics change, the Company will assess whether the asset should be moved to another pool. This analysis and the review of credit quality indicators are performed at each quarter-end, or more often as deemed necessary based on specific facts and circumstances. Specific reserves are established for these assets if it is determined that there is a higher probability of default, which considers the aging of the receivable balances and the financial condition of the counterparty. ----- consideration of customers' financial conditions and macroeconomic conditions. For trade receivables and unbilled accounts receivable, credit quality indicators relate to collection history and the delinquency status of amounts due, which is determined based on the aging of such receivables. For certain other financial assets including contract assets, lease receivables, other accrued and unbilled receivables, credit quality indicators are generally based on rating agency data, publicly available information and information provided by customers which may affect their ability to pay. Financial assets are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible. Prior to the adoption of CECL, the accounts receivable allowances for both trade receivables and lease receivables were estimated based on historical collection experience, an analysis of the age of outstanding accounts receivable, and credit issuance experience. Receivables were considered past due if payment was not received by the date agreed upon with the customers. Write-offs were made when management believed it was probable a receivable would not be recovered. Funds Receivable and Funds Held for Clients and Client Fund Obligations.** Funds receivable and funds held for clients represent amounts received or expected to be received from clients in advance of performing titling and registration services on behalf of those clients. These amounts are classified in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total amount due to remit for titling and registration obligations with the department of motor vehicles is recorded to client fund obligations which is classified as accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company performs an evaluation of goodwill, utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative impairment test. A",216.81.1,,"qualitative assessment is performed at least annually to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The Company performs a quantitative impairment test for each reporting unit every three years, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The annual test for impairment is conducted as of October 1 (Successor) and April 1 (Predecessor). A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level. Under a qualitative assessment, the most recent quantitative assessment is used to determine if it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's goodwill is impaired. As part of this qualitative assessment, the Company assesses relevant events and circumstances including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in share price and entity-specific events to determine if there is an indication of impairment. Under a quantitative assessment, goodwill impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The fair value of a reporting unit is generally determined by using a weighted combination of an income approach and a market approach, as this combination is considered the most indicative of the Company's fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. Under the income approach, the Company determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows of a reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. The estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit are based on internally generated forecasts for the remainder of the respective reporting period and the next five to ten years. Under the market approach, the Company utilizes valuation multiples derived from publicly available information for guideline companies to provide an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for a company. The valuation multiples are applied to the reporting units. ----- including revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others.

The Company determines the fair value of financial instruments in accordance with ASC No. 820,",216.85.1,,"""Fair Value Measurements"" (""ASC 820""). This standard defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. A fair value hierarchy has been established based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable. - Level 1: Inputs that are based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. - Level 2: Inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. - Level 3: Unobservable inputs where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability. These inputs reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use to price the assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, and other current liabilities are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

For cash flow hedges that are designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships, the ----- management objectives and strategies for undertaking each accounting hedge. The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and option volatility. To comply with the provisions of ASC 820, the Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company also considers the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. However, as of December 31, 2022, the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The accounting treatment for derivative gains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation. Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations line items to which the derivative instruments relate.

Revenue Contract Balances,216.109.1,,"_Accounts Receivable_ ----- required before payment of consideration is due. The Company receives payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules. Payment terms can vary by contract but the period between invoicing and when payments are due is not significant. The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Included in accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are unbilled receivable balances which have not yet been invoiced. As of December 31, 2022 (Successor), June 30, 2022 (Predecessor), and June 30, 2021 (Predecessor), the balance of accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, was $254.5 million, $246.8 million, and $236.4 million, respectively, inclusive of unbilled receivables of $1.2 million, $1.7 million, and $1.8 million, respectively. _Contract Assets_ A contract asset is recognized when a conditional right to consideration exists and transfer of control has occurred. Contract assets are typically related to subscription contracts where the transaction price allocated to the satisfied performance obligation exceeds the value of billings to-date. Contract assets are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis and are included in other current assets for the current portion and other assets for the long-term portion on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company regularly reviews contract asset balances for impairment, considering factors such as historical experience, creditworthiness, age of the balance, and other economic or business factors. Refer to Note 9, _Allowance for Credit Losses, for more information about contract assets exposure to credit losses. Contract asset impairments were not significant in any reporting period presented herein. Contract assets were $56.6 million, $60.0 million, and $64.3 million as of December 31, 2022 (Successor), June 30, 2022 (Predecessor), and June 30, 2021 (Predecessor), respectively. _Deferred Revenue_ The Company's deferred revenue primarily consists of payments received from customers, or such consideration that is contractually due, in advance of providing the product or performing services. Deferred revenue is reported in a net position on a contract-bycontract basis at the end of each reporting period. As of December 31, 2022 (Successor), June 30, 2022 (Predecessor), and June 30, 2021 (Predecessor), the deferred revenue balance was $66.9 million, $64.3 million, and $69.0 million respectively. Remaining Performance Obligations.** A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The following information represents the total transaction price for the remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2022 related to non-cancelable contracts, including contracts less than one year in duration, which is expected to be recognized over future periods. As of December 31, 2022 (Successor), the Company had $2,520.0 million of remaining performance obligations which represent contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, including contracted revenue where the contract's original expected duration is one year or less. The Company expects to recognize approximately $1,050.0 million of the remaining performance obligations as revenue for year 2023, $710.0 million for year 2024, $470.0 million for year 2025, $210.0 million for year 2026, $70.0 million for year 2027, and $10.0 million thereafter. The remaining performance obligations exclude future transaction revenue where revenue is recognized as the services are rendered and in the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice. Costs to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract.** The Company capitalizes certain contract acquisition costs consisting primarily of commissions incurred when contracts are signed. The Company does not capitalize commissions related to contracts with a duration of less than one year; such commissions are expensed in selling and marketing expenses when incurred. Costs to fulfill contracts are capitalized when such costs are direct and related to transition or installation activities for hosted software solutions. Capitalized costs to fulfill contracts primarily include travel and employee compensation and benefit related costs for the Company's implementation and training teams. Capitalized costs to obtain a contract and most costs to fulfill a contract are amortized over a period of five years which represents the expected period of benefit of these costs. In instances where the contract term is significantly less than five years, costs to fulfill are amortized over the contract term which the Company believes best reflects the period of benefit of these costs. CDK's cost to obtain and fulfill contracts acquired by Parent through the Acquisition were assigned a fair value that approximated zero. As of December 31, 2022 (Successor), June 30, 2022 (Predecessor), and June 30, 2021 (Predecessor), the Company had capitalized contract acquisition and fulfillment costs of $40.5 million, $223.7 million, and $195.7 million, respectively. The Company expects that incremental commission fees incurred as a result of obtaining contracts and fulfillment costs are recoverable.

The remainder of this note provides disclosures for the 2014 Plan for the Predecessor reporting periods prior to the plan's termination. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense associated with employee equity awards in earnings based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant. The Company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. Stock-based compensation primarily consisted of the following: Time-Based Stock Options and Performance-Based Stock Options.** Time-based stock options and performance-based stock options had a term of ten years. Upon termination of employment, unvested stock options were evaluated for forfeiture or modification, subject to the terms of the awards and Company policies. Time-based stock options were granted to employees at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant and were generally issued under a three or four-year graded vesting schedule. Performance-based stock options were granted to the then-CEO at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company's stock on the date of grant. These awards vested, subject to the Company's stock price performance and the CEO's continued employment with the Company, over a three-year performance period. Time-Based Restricted Stock and Time-Based Restricted Stock Units.** Time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units generally vested over a two to five-year period. Upon termination of employment, unvested time-based awards were evaluated for forfeiture or modification, subject to the terms of the awards and Company policies. Time-based restricted stock could not be transferred during the vesting period. Compensation expense related to the issuance of time-based restricted stock was measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date and recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Employees were eligible to receive cash dividends on the CDK shares awarded under the time-based restricted stock program during the restricted period. Time-based restricted stock units were primarily settled in cash for non-U.S. recipients and could be settled in stock or cash for U.S. recipients at the discretion of the Company and could not be transferred during the restriction period. Compensation expense related to the issuance of time-based restricted stock units was recorded over the vesting period and was initially based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. Cash-settled, time-based restricted stock units were subsequently remeasured at each reporting date during the vesting period to the current stock value. For grants made prior to September 6, 2018, no dividend equivalents were paid on units awarded during the restricted period. For grants made on or subsequent to September 6, 2018, U.S. recipients were credited with dividend equivalents on units awarded during the restricted period, and no dividend equivalents were paid or credited on units awarded to non-U.S. recipients during the restricted period. Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units.** Performance-based restricted stock units generally vested over a three-year performance period. Under these programs, the Company communicated ""target awards"" at the beginning of the performance period with possible payouts at the end of the performance period ranging from 0% to 260% of the ""target awards"". Certain performancebased awards were further subject to adjustment based on a market condition, defined as total stockholder return of the Company's common stock compared to a peer group of companies. The probability associated with the achievement of performance conditions affected the vesting of the Company's performance-based awards. Expense was only recognized for those shares expected to vest. Upon termination of employment, unvested awards were evaluated for forfeiture or modification, subject to the terms of the awards and Company policies. ----- discretion of the Company and were settled in cash for all other employees and could not be transferred during the vesting period. Compensation expense related to the issuance of performance-based restricted stock units settled in cash was recorded over the vesting period, was initially based on the fair value of the award on the grant date and was subsequently remeasured at each reporting date to the current stock value during the performance period, based upon the probability that the performance target would be met. Compensation expense related to the issuance of performance-based restricted stock units settled in stock was recorded over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. Prior to settlement, dividend equivalents were earned on ""target awards"" under the performance-based restricted stock unit program.

The purpose of the SMLTIP and ELTIP is to retain senior management personnel of the Company, to incentivize them to make decisions with a long-term view and to influence behavior in a way that is consistent with maximizing value for the stockholder of the Company in a prudent manner. The awards are not tax deductible for the Company until the payment is fixed and determinable. _SMLTIP_ These awards will become vested based on the continued service of the employee at the rate of 20% of the total award on each of the first through the fifth anniversaries of the date of the Acquisition. If a participant ceases to provide service prior to any applicable vesting date, then each unvested award will be forfeited for no consideration. Further, any portion of a participant’s award that is vested as of the date such participant ceases to provide service will continue to be outstanding and eligible to be settled in accordance with the terms of the plan. Vested awards will become exercisable upon the earlier of: (i) a change in Control (as defined below), and (ii) July 1, 2027. Any cash payout value of these awards will be determined upon settlement at the earlier of: (i) the sale by Brookfield of at least 70% of its common equity in CDK (a “Change in Control”), and (ii) July 1, 2027, and will be determined by multiplying the participant award by a payout factor according to the terms and conditions of the plan that ranges between zero and 200%. However, any participant who was a participant as of August 31, 2022 and who will be providing service as of June 30, 2025 may elect to have 50% of their vested awards outstanding as of June 30, 2025 immediately exercisable, provided that the CDK's valuation is at least two times the Threshold Value as of June 30, 2025. Payments of the awards under this election will be made in cash by the Company and will be determined by multiplying the dollar value of an award by a Payout Factor (as defined in the plan). Participants will not be entitled to any voting rights or interim cash distributions under the SMLTIP awards granted to them. ----- each of the five annual vesting tranches as award recipients provide service to the Company, with a corresponding liability within other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2022, the granted pool of outstanding awards was $32.4 million; CDK has recognized expense of $4.9 million. None of the awards have vested as of December 31, 2022. _ELTIP_ The ELTIP has two types of awards: General Option Units and Stretch Option Units (collectively, the “Option Units”). - General Option Units – The number of these units to be granted to each participant will be determined by a share in the General Incentive Pool. A total of 8.3 million General Option Units are available for allocation to the participants. Each General Option Unit represents a notional interest in the General Incentive Pool. The General Incentive Pool shall be the dollar amount represented by approximately 2.4% of the sale proceeds realized by Brookfield as of any date of determination in excess of the Threshold Value of $3,453.0 million. - Stretch Option Units – Each participant will be allocated one Stretch Option Unit for every four General Option Units that he/she receives. However, Brookfield maintains the discretion to grant to a participant a higher or lower number of Stretch Option Units. Each Stretch Option Unit equates to one share in the Stretch Incentive Pool. The Stretch Incentive Pool shall be the dollar amount represented by approximately 0.6% of the sale proceeds realized by Brookfield as of any date of determination in excess of the Stretch Threshold Value (i.e., an amount equal to $8,632.5 million plus the dollar value of any cash or other consideration contributed to or invested in the Company by Brookfield after July 6, 2022.) A total of 2.07 million Stretch Option Units will be available for allocation to all participants. Each Stretch Option Unit represents a notional interest in the Stretch Incentive Pool. Option Units vest based on the continued service of the employee at the rate of 20% on each of the first through the fifth anniversaries of the date of grant. If a participant ceases to provide service prior to any applicable vesting date, then each unvested option will be forfeited for no consideration. Further, the portion of a participant’s Option Units that is vested as of the date such participant ceases to provide service to the Company will continue to be outstanding and eligible to be settled in accordance with the terms of the plan. Employees will not be entitled to any voting rights or interim cash distributions because of Option Units granted to them. However, any interim return of capital (including dividends) from CDK to Brookfield will be included in the calculation of the final profit pool. Payment under the ELTIP will only occur if and when Brookfield sells at least 70% of its common equity in CDK. To the extent Brookfield has sold greater than 70% of its ownership in CDK but less than 100%, all payments made under the ELTIP will be calculated as though Brookfield sold all of its equity interest in CDK. Payment of vested Option Units will be made in a lump sum cash within 30 days following the consummation date of a Change in Control, based on the sale proceeds received by Brookfield in connection with the Change in Control. The value of each Option Unit will be determined by multiplying the total amount of the General Incentive Pool and Stretch Incentive Pool by a fraction, the numerator of which is such participant’s vested Option Units and the denominator of which is the total number of Option Units available under the incentive pools (8.3 million units in case of General Option Unit and 2.07 million units in case of Stretch Option Units). Further, one-half of all General Option Units allocated to any participant will have the 50% condition of exercise applied to them whereby the number of awards is to be reduced if the sale proceeds are less than 2.5 times the Threshold Value. These units are to be only exercisable on a proportionate basis between: (a) the point at which the sale proceeds received by Brookfield in connection with the Change in Control are equal to the Threshold Value on the one hand; and (b) the point at which the sale proceeds received by Brookfield are equal to the Stretch Threshold Value on the other hand. Participants will not be entitled to any voting rights or interim cash distributions under the of Option Units granted to them. However, any interim return of capital (including dividends) from CDK to Brookfield will be included in the calculation of the final profit pool. Brookfield has discretion to issue awards to employees of the Company above and beyond the authorized number of units the Company has been given. The terms of those awards are substantially consistent with the ELTIP program described above, provided, however, that vesting provisions may vary at the discretion of Brookfield. As of December 31, 2022, Brookfield has issued 3.3 million General Option Units and 0.8 million Stretch Option Units to certain employees in accordance with its discretion. ELTIP awards are subject to service, performance (change in control) and market conditions. As of December 31, 2022, the Company does not believe the performance condition is met or likely to be met, and therefore no compensation cost has been recognized and the fair value of the ELTIP grants is zero. The Company has 5.3 million General Option Units and 1.3 million Stretch Option Units outstanding as of December 31, 2022, none of which have vested. ----- On July 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13 using a modified retrospective approach. The noncash cumulative effect of adopting CECL resulted in a decrease of $8.2 million, net of tax impacts, to retained earnings, with corresponding increases to the allowance for expected credit losses impacting accounts receivable, net, other current assets and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cumulative-effect adjustment in retained earnings includes amounts related to the International Business, which represented an impact upon adoption of $1.2 million, net of tax. At adoption, there was no impact on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Cash Flows. The impacts related to prior comparative periods have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior periods. Credit loss expense is included in general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

These lawsuits have been transferred to, or filed in, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois for consolidated and coordinated pretrial proceedings as part of a multi-district litigation proceeding (""MDL""). - Teterboro Automall, Inc. d/b/a Teterboro Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram (""Teterboro"") brought a putative class action suit on behalf of itself and all similarly situated automobile dealerships against CDK and Reynolds. Teterboro has disclosed an expert who opined that the dealerships suffered direct and indirect damages of approximately $339 million. Teterboro’s suit was originally filed on October 19, 2017, in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. Since that time, several more putative class actions were filed in a number of federal district courts, with substantively similar allegations; all of them have been consolidated with the MDL proceeding. On June 4, 2018, a consolidated class action complaint was filed on behalf of a putative class made up of all dealerships in the United States that allegedly directly purchased DMS and/or indirectly data integration services from CDK or Reynolds and several subclasses of such dealers in certain states (""Putative Dealership Class Plaintiffs""). CDK moved to dismiss the complaint, or in the alternative, compel arbitration of certain Putative Dealership Class Plaintiffs’ claims while staying the remainder pending the outcome of those arbitration proceedings; its motion to dismiss was granted in part and denied in part, while its motion to compel arbitration was denied. On February 22, 2019, CDK filed an answer to the remaining claims in Putative Dealership Class Plaintiffs' complaint and asserted counterclaims against certain Putative Dealership Class Plaintiffs. The Putative Dealership Class Plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss CDK’s counterclaims; that motion was granted in part and denied in part on September 3, 2019. On October 23, 2018, the Putative Dealership Class Plaintiffs and Reynolds filed a motion for preliminary approval of settlement and for conditional certification of the proposed settlement class. The court finally approved that settlement on January 22, 2019. The parties' cross-motions for summary judgment and Daubert motions were fully briefed as of September 28, 2020. On January 21, 2022 the court issued a memorandum opinion and order with respect to the _Daubert motions, granting the motions in part and denying them in part.  The court excluded the opinion disclosed by the_ Putative Dealership Class Plaintiffs’ expert that the Class suffered $339 million in direct damages, but held that the Class may continue to seek indirect damages under state laws that permit recovery of such damages. The parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment remain pending. - Loop LLC d/b/a AutoLoop (""AutoLoop"") brought suit against CDK on April 9, 2018, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, but purported to reserve its rights to seek a transfer to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin at the conclusion of the MDL proceedings. On June 5, 2018, AutoLoop amended its complaint to sue on behalf of itself and a putative class of all other automotive software vendors in the United States that purchased data integration services from CDK or Reynolds. Autoloop has disclosed an expert who opines that the proposed vendor class suffered direct damages totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, but the precise amount of the vendors’ damages claim has not been publicly disclosed. CDK moved to compel arbitration of AutoLoop's claims, or in the alternative, to dismiss those claims; that motion was denied on January 25, 2019. CDK filed an answer to AutoLoop’s complaint and asserted counterclaims against AutoLoop on February 15, 2019. AutoLoop filed an answer to CDK's counterclaims on March 8, 2019. The parties' cross-motions for summary judgment and Daubert motions were fully briefed as of September 28, 2020. On January 21, 2022 the court issued a memorandum opinion and order with respect to the Daubert motions, granting the motions in part and denying in part. The parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment remain pending. CDK believes that the remaining unsettled cases are without merit and will continue to vigorously contest all asserted claims. Nonetheless, in light of CDK's settlements with Authenticom, i3 Brands, MVSC, and Cox and its continued expenditure of legal costs to contest the remaining claims, the Company has determined that a range of possible loss outcomes is probable and can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2022, the litigation liability for the remaining unsettled cases was $34.0 million. This ----- best estimate of such loss. Estimating the value of this range of loss involved significant judgment given the uncertainty that still exists with respect to the remaining unsettled cases due to a variety of factors typical of complex, large scale litigation, including, among others: (i) formative issues, including: (a) the causes of action the plaintiffs can pursue; (b) the definition of the class(es) of plaintiffs; (c) the types of damages that can be recovered; and (d) whether plaintiffs can establish loss causation as a matter of law, all of which have yet to be determined pending the outcome of dispositive motions (e.g., motions for class certification and motions for summary judgment); (ii) significant factual issues remain to be resolved; (iii) expert perspectives with respect to, among other things, alleged antitrust injury and damages is widely divergent and remains subject to dispositive motions; (iv) the absence of productive settlement discussions to date with the remaining plaintiffs; and (v) the novel or uncertain nature of the legal issues presented. In addition, the Company's estimate does not incorporate or reflect the potential value of the Company's counterclaims against certain of the plaintiffs in the ongoing cases. The legal proceedings underlying the estimated litigation liability will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from the estimate. As noted above, an adverse result in any of the remaining cases could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. On June 22, 2017, CDK received from the Federal Trade Commission (""FTC"") a Civil Investigative Demand consisting of specifications calling for the production of documents relating to any agreements between the CDK and Reynolds. Parallel document requests have been received from certain states' Attorneys General. Since 2017, CDK has engaged in continuing communication with and received subsequent requests from the FTC related to its investigation. CDK has responded to the requests and no proceedings have been instituted. CDK believes there has not been any conduct by CDK or its current or former employees that would be actionable under the antitrust laws in connection with the agreements between CDK and Reynolds or otherwise. At this time, the Company does not have sufficient information to predict the outcome of, or the cost of responding to or resolving, these investigations. Other Commitments and Contingencies.** In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into contracts in which the Company makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Company’s services and products.

In general, the Company would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event the Company defaulted in performing the obligations under each contract, of which, the probability is remote.
