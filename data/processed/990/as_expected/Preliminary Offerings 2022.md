**Preliminary Offering Memorandum** **Strictly Confidential**

# Central Parent Inc. Central Merger Sub Inc.
## $750,000,000        % First Lien Notes due 2029


Central Parent Inc. (the “Issuer” or “Parent”), a Delaware corporation, and Central Merger Sub Inc. (the “Co-Issuer” or “Merger Sub” and, together with the
Issuer, the “Issuers”), a Delaware corporation, are jointly and severally offering as co-issuers $750,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of     % First Lien
Notes due 2029 (the “Notes”). Merger Sub is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and Parent is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Central Holdings Inc., a Delaware
corporation (“Holdings”) formed by affiliates of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and Brookfield Capital Partners VI L.P. (together, “Brookfield”). The Notes
are being issued in connection with the proposed acquisition (the “Acquisition”) by Parent of CDK Global, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company” or
“CDK”) through a cash tender offer (the “Equity Tender Offer”) by Merger Sub to purchase all the outstanding shares of common stock of CDK and, subject to
the consummation of the Equity Tender Offer, the merger (the “Merger”) of Merger Sub with and into CDK with CDK as the surviving entity, in each case, as
further described herein.

This offering may be completed prior to the consummation of the Acquisition. In that case, upon consummation of this offering, we will deposit the gross
proceeds of the offering into a segregated escrow account until the date (the “Escrow Release Date”) that certain conditions (the “Escrow Release Conditions”) are
satisfied. The Escrow Release Conditions include the consummation of the Acquisition in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
April 7, 2022 (as it may be amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Parent, Merger Sub and CDK. Prior to the consummation of the
Acquisition, the Notes will only be guaranteed by Holdings and will only be secured by a first-priority security interest in the escrow account and all deposits and
investment property therein. If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to January 5, 2023 as described herein (the “Escrow End Date”) or if we notify the
Trustee and the Escrow Agent (each as defined herein) in writing that the Merger Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Notes will be
subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price will be equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the Notes (as set forth
below), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from the issue date of the Notes, up to, but not including, the date of such special mandatory redemption. If the
closing of this offering of Notes occurs on the closing date of the Acquisition, the escrow provisions set forth herein will not be applicable. See “Description of
Notes—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

The Notes will mature on           , 2029. The Notes will bear interest at a rate of     % per annum. Interest on the Notes will accrue
from          , 2022 and the Issuers will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually, in cash in arrears, on           and           of each year, beginning
on          , 2022. From and after the Escrow Release Date, the Notes will be, jointly and severally, unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings and each of the
Issuer’s existing and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that will guarantee the Issuers’ obligations under the New Credit Facilities (as defined herein)
(together with Holdings, the “Guarantors”).


From and after the Escrow Release Date, the Notes and related guarantees will be secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral (as defined herein), which
consists of substantially all of the assets that secure the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ obligations under the New Credit Facilities, subject to certain exceptions and
permitted liens as described herein. See “Description of Notes—Security for the Notes.” From and after the Escrow Release Date, the Notes will (i) be pari passu
in right of payment with all of the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness secured on a first-lien basis, including the Issuers’ existing
and future borrowings under the New First Lien Credit Facilities (as defined herein), (ii) rank senior in lien priority to junior lien indebtedness of the Issuers and
the Guarantors, including the Issuers’ existing and future borrowings under the New Second Lien Credit Facilities (as defined herein), (iii) rank effectively senior
in right of payment to all of the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, including the Existing Notes (as defined herein), to
the extent of the value of the Collateral and (iv) be structurally subordinated to any existing and future obligations of any subsidiaries of the Issuers that do not
guarantee the Notes.

The Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time on or after           , 2025 on the applicable redemption dates and at the redemption
prices specified in this offering memorandum. Prior to such dates, we may redeem some or all of the Notes at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, plus a “make whole” premium. We may also redeem (i) up to 40% of the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes before           , 2025 with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings, (ii) up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes during any 12-month period prior to          , 2025 and/or (iii) an aggregate principal amount of the Notes in amount not to exceed the proceeds
received from any disposition of our non-automotive DMS business line during the 12-month period prior to         , 2023 provided that at least $300.0
million of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption (unless all the Notes are
redeemed substantially concurrently), in each case at the applicable redemption prices described herein. If we experience a Change of Control (as defined herein),
we must offer to repurchase the Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.

You should read this offering memorandum carefully before you invest in the Notes. Investing in the Notes involves risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on
page 33 for a discussion of certain risks that you should consider in connection with an investment in the Notes.


Issue price:     % (plus accrued interest, if any, from          , 2022)

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any state securities laws and the
Notes are being offered and sold only to persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers” in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act
(“Rule 144A”) and outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”). Prospective purchasers are hereby
notified that the seller of the Notes may be relying on Rule 144A. Holders of the Notes will not have the benefit of registration rights with respect to the Notes.
For a description of restrictions on transfers of the Notes, see “Transfer Restrictions.”


The initial purchasers of the Notes (the “initial purchasers”) expect to deliver to investors the Notes only in book-entry form through the facilities of The
Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) on or about          , 2022 (the “Closing Date”).

For purposes of this offering memorandum, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, the
term “Issuers” refers to Central Merger Sub Inc. and Central Parent Inc. or CDK Global, Inc., as the context
requires, collectively. The terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “our company” and “Company” refer to CDK or the Issuers, as
the context requires, in each case, together with its or their consolidated subsidiaries, and for purposes of the
description of the business, giving effect to the completion of the Acquisition as further described herein.

Unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, references to “fiscal year” and “2021,” “2020” and
“2019” are references to the Company’s fiscal years ended June 30 of the applicable year.

We and the initial purchasers have not authorized anyone to provide any information other than that contained
in this document or to which we or the initial purchasers have referred you. We and the initial purchasers take no
responsibility for, and can provide no assurance as to the reliability of, any other information that others may give
you. This document may only be used where it is legal to sell these securities. You should not assume that the
information contained in this offering memorandum is accurate as of any date other than the date on the front cover
of this offering memorandum.

This offering memorandum has been prepared by us solely for use in connection with the proposed offering of
the Notes described herein. This offering memorandum is confidential and personal to each offeree and does not
constitute an offer to any other person or the public generally to subscribe for or otherwise acquire the Notes.
Distribution of this offering memorandum to any person other than the offeree and those persons, if any, retained to
advise such offeree with respect to this offering memorandum is unauthorized and any disclosure of any of its
contents without our prior written consent is prohibited. By accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, you
agree to the foregoing and not to make any photocopies, in whole or in part, of this offering memorandum or any
documents delivered in connection with this offering memorandum.

The initial purchasers make no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of the information contained in this offering memorandum, and nothing contained in this offering
memorandum is, nor should you rely upon it as, a promise or representation, whether as to the past or the future.

The information contained in this offering memorandum is as of the date of this offering memorandum and is
subject to change, completion or amendment without notice. Neither the delivery of this offering memorandum at


-----

any time nor the offer, sale or delivery of any Note shall, under any circumstances, create any implication that there
has been no change in the information set forth in this offering memorandum or in our affairs since the date of this
offering memorandum.

No person is authorized in connection with this offering to give any information or to make any representation
not contained in this offering memorandum, and, if given or made, such other information or representation must not
be relied upon as having been authorized by the Issuers or the initial purchasers or any of the Issuers’ or the initial
purchasers’ respective representatives.

**Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) nor any state securities commission nor**
**any other regulatory authority has approved or disapproved of these securities or determined if this offering**
**memorandum is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.**

By purchasing the Notes, you will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations, warranties and
agreements as set forth under “Transfer Restrictions” in this offering memorandum. We are not, and the initial
purchasers are not, making an offer to sell the Notes in any jurisdiction except where an offer or sale is permitted.

We are making this offering in reliance on an exemption from registration under the Securities Act for offers
and sales of securities that do not involve a public offering. The Notes may not be offered or sold except pursuant to
an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any
applicable state securities laws. Laws in certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of this offering
memorandum and the offer and sale of the Notes. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum or any
of the Notes are delivered must inform themselves about, and observe, those restrictions. You must comply with all
applicable laws and regulations in force in any applicable jurisdiction, and you must obtain any consent, approval or
permission required for the purchase, offer or sale by you of the Notes under the laws and regulations in force in the
jurisdiction to which you are subject or in which you make such purchase, offer or sale, and neither we nor the initial
purchasers will have any responsibility therefor.

The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except as
permitted under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws pursuant to registration or exemption
therefrom. As a prospective purchaser, you should be aware that you may be required to bear the financial risks of
this investment for an indefinite period of time. See “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions.”

The offering is being made on the basis of this offering memorandum and is subject to the terms described in
this offering memorandum and the indenture relating to the Notes. In making an investment decision, prospective
investors must rely on their own examination of the Issuers and the terms of the offering, including the merits and
risks involved. Prospective investors should not construe anything in this offering memorandum as legal, business or
tax advice. Each prospective investor should consult its own advisors as needed to make its investment decision and
to determine whether it is legally permitted to purchase the securities under applicable legal investment or similar
laws or regulations.

Each prospective investor must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction in
which it purchases, offers or sells Notes or possesses or distributes this offering memorandum and must obtain any
consent, approval or permission required by it for the purchase, offer or sale by it of Notes under the laws and
regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which it is subject or in which it makes such purchases, offers or sales, and
neither we nor the initial purchasers nor any of our or their respective representatives shall have any responsibility
therefor.

The Issuers do not intend to apply for listing of the Notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the
Notes in any automated quotation system.

The Notes will be available in book-entry form only. We expect that the Notes sold pursuant to this offering
memorandum will be issued in the form of one or more global certificates, which will be deposited with, or on
behalf of, DTC, and registered in its name or in the name of Cede & Co., its nominee. Beneficial interests in the
global certificates relating to the Notes will be shown on, and transfers of such global certificates will be effected
only through, records maintained by DTC and its direct and indirect participants. After the initial issuance of the
global certificates, Notes in certificated form will be issued in exchange for the global certificates only as set forth in
the indenture that will govern the Notes. See “Book Entry, Delivery and Form.”


-----

The Issuers reserve the right to withdraw this offering of Notes at any time and the Issuers and the initial
purchasers reserve the right to reject any commitment to subscribe for the Notes, in whole or in part. The Issuers and
the initial purchasers also reserve the right to allot to you less than the full amount of Notes sought by you. The
initial purchasers and certain related entities may acquire for their own account a portion of the Notes.

In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell Notes in the open market. The
initial purchasers may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes that, if
commenced, may be discontinued. Specifically, the initial purchasers may over-allot in connection with this offering
and may bid for and purchase the Notes in the open market. For a description of these activities, see “Plan of
Distribution.”

This offering memorandum contains summaries believed to be accurate with respect to certain documents, but
reference is made to the actual documents for complete information. All of those summaries are qualified in their
entirety by this reference. Copies of documents referred to herein will be made available to prospective investors
upon request to the Issuers or the initial purchasers.

By accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, you acknowledge that (1) you have been afforded an
opportunity to request and to review all additional information considered by you to be necessary to verify the
accuracy of, or to supplement, the information contained in this offering memorandum, (2) you have not relied on
the initial purchasers or any person affiliated with the initial purchasers in connection with the investigation of the
accuracy of such information or your investment decision, (3) this offering memorandum relates to an offering that
is exempt from registration under the Securities Act and (4) no person has been authorized to give information or to
make any representations concerning us, this offering or the Notes described in this offering memorandum, other
than as contained in this offering memorandum.

This offering memorandum may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part, and it may only be distributed
and disclosed to the prospective investors to whom it is provided.

You should contact the initial purchasers with any questions about this offering or if you require additional
information to verify the information contained in this offering memorandum.

**ALTERNATIVE SETTLEMENT CYCLE**

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made to investors on or about    , 2022, which will be the
business day following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement being referred to as “T+    “).
Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the
secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree
otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes hereunder more than two business days prior to the
scheduled closing date for this offering will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially settle in T+
, to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement.
Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes hereunder during such period should consult their advisors.

**CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This offering memorandum contains forward-looking statements that are forward-looking and, therefore,
subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical fact or relating to present facts or
current conditions included in this offering memorandum are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements generally include statements that are
predictive in nature and depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, and include words such as “believes,”
“plans,” “anticipates,” “projects,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “may,”
“will,” “should,” “could,” “potential,” or similar expressions. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve
risks and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future, and
there are many factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or
implied by these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements
about the ability of the parties to complete the Transactions (as defined herein) and the expected timing of
completion of the Transactions; as well as any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. The forward-looking
statements are, and will be, based on management’s current views and assumptions regarding future events and
operating performance and speak only as of their dates. We caution that these statements are subject to numerous
important risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, that could cause
our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Investors
are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements
are only made as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation, and disclaim any obligation, to update forwardlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof, except as required by
applicable law or regulations. The following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ
from current expectations:

  - the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on how we and our customers are operating our businesses,
and the duration and extent to which this will impact our business, results of operations, and financial
condition remains uncertain;

  - risks relating to intense competition we face in the industry and the need to respond quickly to
technological developments or customers’ shifting technological requirements or to compete effectively
against other providers of technology solutions to automotive retailers, OEMs, and other participants in the
automotive retail industry;

  - market trends influencing the automotive retail industry;

  - market acceptance of and influence over our products and services being concentrated in a limited number
of automobile OEMs and consolidated retailer groups;

  - our ability to develop and bring products and services in development to market or bring new products and
services to market in a timely manner or at all;

  - our failure or inability to execute any element of our business strategy;

  - dependency on our key management, direct sales force, and technical personnel for continued success;

  - real or perceived errors or failures in our software and systems negatively impacting our results of
operations and growth prospects;

  - cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities leading to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or
damage to our reputation;

  - interruption or failure of our networks, systems, and infrastructure hurting our ability to effectively provide
our products and services, which could damage our reputation and/or subject us to litigation or contractual
penalties;

  - events beyond our control;


-----

  - risk relating to our utilizing certain key technologies, data, and services from, and integrating certain of our
solutions with, third parties that we may be unable to replace if they become obsolete, unavailable, or
incompatible with our solutions;

  - dependence on suppliers and manufacturers;

  - risks relating to our involvement in litigation that is expensive and time consuming and, if resolved
adversely, may materially adversely affect us;

  - protection of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights;

  - claims that we or our technologies infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a
third party requiring us to incur significant costs, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, or develop or
license substitute technology;

  - risks relating to our strategic acquisitions and formed strategic alliances and our ability to find suitable
acquisitions or alliance partners that strengthen our value proposition to customers or to achieve the
expected benefits from such acquisitions or alliances;

  - liability for contract or product liability claims, and disputes over such claims;

  - failure of our customers to renew subscriptions in accordance with our expectations;

  - downturns or upturns in new business not being immediately reflected in our operating results because we
recognize a majority of our revenue from our subscription-based products and services over the term of the
subscription;

  - return on investment in research and development efforts for new and existing products and technologies
and technical sales support being lower or developing more slowly than we expect;

  - inability to access capital markets on terms acceptable to us or at all;

  - extensive and complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad that our business is directly and
indirectly subject to, and new laws and regulations and/or changes to existing laws and regulations, as well
as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government action;

  - new regulations that restrict the manner and extent to which we can control access to our DMS and other
software applications and limit what, if anything, we may charge for integration with those applications;

  - complex and rapidly evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulation regarding privacy and data protection
that our business is directly and indirectly subject to;

  - changes in, or interpretations of, accounting principles;

  - exposure to unanticipated tax liabilities;

  - changes in tax laws or tax rulings;

  - risks related to our current level of indebtedness including our ability to raise additional capital to fund our
operations and our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry;

  - high levels of indebtedness and debt service obligations effectively reducing the amount of funds available
for other business purposes; and

  - negative rating actions by credit rating agencies.

See “Risk Factors” for a further description of these risks and other factors that could prevent us from achieving
our goals, and cause the assumptions underlying forward-looking statements and the actual results to differ
materially from those expressed in or implied by those forward-looking statements.

**ROUNDING**

Certain figures included in this offering memorandum have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly,
figures shown as totals in certain tables may not be arithmetic aggregations of the figures that precede them.

**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

We have included certain supplemental financial measures of our performance in this offering memorandum
that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (“GAAP”), including, for example, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
Margin, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Conversion and Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue. Adjusted EBITDA, Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Conversion and Pro Forma
Adjusted Revenue are not prepared with a view towards compliance with published guidelines of the SEC, and are
not measures of net income, operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP,
and is subject to important limitations. Our use of the terms Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Conversion and Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue may
vary from others in our industry. For additional information regarding our use of Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Conversion and Pro Forma
Adjusted Revenue including the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and to investors,
and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash
Flow, Free Cash Flow Conversion and Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue to the most closely comparable financial
measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, see “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and
Other Data.”

Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow
Conversion and Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not
consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial performance as reported under GAAP and
should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance
with GAAP as measures of operating performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as
measures of our liquidity.

We do not as a matter of course make public projections as to future sales, earnings or other results. However,
our management team, together with external advisors and Brookfield, has prepared the prospective financial
information set forth below and described under “Summary—Identified margin improvement initiatives” to present
the expected margin improvements. The accompanying prospective financial information was not prepared with a
view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information, but, in the view of the
Company’s management, was prepared on a reasonable basis, reflects the best currently available estimates and
judgments, and presents, to the best of management’s knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and the
expected future financial performance of the Company. However, this information is not fact and should not be
relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this offering memorandum are cautioned
not to place undue reliance on the prospective financial information. Neither the Company’s independent auditors,
nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the
prospective financial information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of
assurance on such information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association
with, the prospective financial information. See “Risk Factors—We may not realize the anticipated cost savings and
margin improvements from the Transactions.”

**NO SEC REVIEW; NO REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

The information included in this offering memorandum does not conform to information that would be required
if this offering were made pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC. This offering memorandum, as
well as any other documents in connection with this offering, will not be reviewed by the SEC. There are no
registration rights associated with the Notes, and we have no intention to offer Notes in a transaction registered
under the Securities Act in exchange for the Notes or to file a registration statement with respect to the Notes. The
indenture that will govern the Notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the


-----

“TIA”), or subject to the terms of, or incorporate any provision of, the TIA. We will provide the information
required pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) upon request.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

Some of the market and industry data contained in this offering memorandum are based on independent
industry publications or other publicly available information. Certain of the market and industry data presented in
this offering memorandum was also gathered prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and may not be directly
comparable. Although we believe that these independent publications and other publicly available information are
reliable as of their respective dates, we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data presented from
independent sources.

In addition, certain market and industry data contained in this offering memorandum are based on internal data,
studies and management estimates, which are derived from information obtained from analysts’ reports, independent
industry publications or publicly available sources, as well as our clients, partners, trade and business organizations
and other contacts in the markets in which we operate, and also reflect our management’s understanding of industry
conditions. Although we believe that such information included in this offering memorandum is reliable as of their
respective dates, such data, studies and estimates, particularly as they relate to market size, market growth,
penetration, market share and our general expectations, involve important risks, uncertainties and assumptions and
are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this offering memorandum. These and other factors could cause results
to differ materially from those expressed in the estimates and beliefs made by the independent parties and by us.

**TRADEMARKS AND TRADENAMES**

This offering memorandum includes registered and unregistered trademarks of ours. All trademarks, tradenames
and service marks appearing in this offering memorandum are the property of their respective owners.

Solely for convenience, certain trademarks, service marks and trade names referred to in this offering
memorandum are listed without the ® and ™ symbols, but such references are not intended to indicate in any way
that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights to these trademarks, service marks and
trade names. We do not intend our use or display of other companies’ trade names, trademarks or service marks to
imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us by, any other companies.

**WHERE YOU CAN FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION; INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE**

In this offering memorandum, we incorporate by reference the information contained in all documents CDK
files with the SEC pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than portions of these
documents that are either (1) described in paragraph (e) of Item 201 of Registration S-K or paragraphs (d)(1)-(3) and
(e)(5) of Item 407 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC or (2) furnished under Item 2.02 or Item 7.01 of a
Current Report on Form 8-K (including any exhibits included with such items, unless otherwise indicated therein)
after the date of this offering memorandum and prior to the termination of the offering under this offering
memorandum. The information contained in any such document will be considered part of this offering
memorandum from the date the document is filed with the SEC.

Any statement contained in a document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum will be deemed to be modified or superseded to the extent that a statement contained herein or in any
other subsequently filed document which also is or is deemed to be incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum modifies or supersedes that statement. Any statement so modified or superseded will not be deemed,
except as so modified or superseded, to constitute a part of this offering memorandum.

Upon completion of the Transactions, we will not be subject to the periodic reporting and other informational
requirements of the Exchange Act. Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the Notes, we will agree that
for so long as any of the Notes remain outstanding, we will furnish to the Trustee and holders of the Notes the
information specified therein.

**SUMMARY**

_This summary highlights selected information appearing elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Because it is_
_a summary, it does not contain all of the information that you should consider before investing in the Notes. You_
_should read this entire offering memorandum, together with all information incorporated by reference herein,_

**Business Overview**

CDK Global Inc. is a leading provider of mission critical technology and software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) data
solutions for dealerships in the automotive retail and adjacent heavy truck, recreation, and heavy equipment
industries in North America. Our solutions automate and integrate all aspects of operating a dealership and the
vehicle buying and servicing process, including the acquisition, sale, financing, insuring, parts supply, and repair
and maintenance of vehicles. Enabling end-to-end, omnichannel retail commerce through open, agnostic technology,
we provide our solutions to both dealers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and served over 15,000
dealer sites and adjacent businesses served across North America as of March 31, 2022.

We generate revenue primarily by providing a broad suite of subscription-based software and technology
solutions to automotive retailers in North America, as well as to retailers and manufacturers of heavy trucks,
construction equipment, agricultural equipment, motorcycles, boats, and other marine and recreational vehicles. We
are focused on the use of SaaS and mobile-centric solutions that are highly functional, flexible, and fast. Our
flagship Dealer Management System (“DMS”) software solutions are hosted enterprise resource planning (“ERP”)
applications tailored to the unique requirements of the retail automotive industry. Our DMS solutions facilitate most
activities that generate revenue within a dealership including: the sale of new and used vehicles, consumer
financing, repair and maintenance services, and vehicle and parts inventory management. These solutions also
enable our customers to have company-wide accounting, financial reporting, cash flow management, and payroll
services. We also provide a broad portfolio of layered software applications and services, a robust and secure
interface to the DMS through our Partner Program, data management and business intelligence solutions, a variety
of professional services, and a full range of customer support solutions. These additional products are integrated
with the DMS and provide a full software solution suite to our customers. Our DMSs are typically integrated with
OEM data processing systems that enable automotive retailers to order vehicles and parts, receive vehicle records,
process warranties, and check recall campaigns and service bulletins while helping them to fulfill their franchisee
responsibilities to their OEM franchisers.

We believe we are the market leader in North America and have the largest installed base of DMS in the
industry. CDK has consistently grown market share and served over 5,600 customers representing over 15,000
dealer sites and adjacent businesses as of March 31, 2022, compared to 14,681 as of Fiscal Year 2019. Within the
core automotive space, CDK is primarily focused on the largest and most sophisticated dealerships, with 78% of
dealership customers having three or more dealer sites in fiscal year 2021, which positions the Company to benefit
from the consolidation trends in the industry. We are deeply embedded in our customers’ operations – the majority
of our customers use three to five CDK products on average, and our average customer tenure is approximately 20
years. The average customer contract length is approximately four years. In the last twelve months (“LTM”) ended
March 31, 2022, approximately 78% of our revenue was generated from multi-year subscription contracts where
revenue is tied to customer site count, not transaction volume.

The strength of our business model is reflected in our financial performance. In the LTM period ended March
31, 2022, we generated approximately $1,763 million of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue, which represents a 3%
compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) since fiscal 2019, and $811 million of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA,
which represents a margin of approximately 46% including $146 million of margin improvement initiatives
identified by Brookfield.

**_Product Offerings_**

Our primary solutions include Dealer Management Systems, layered software applications, and value-added
services and solutions.

Our flagship DMS software solutions are hosted ERP applications tailored to the unique requirements of the
dealer in multiple industries. Dealers use this software solution to manage critical business processes, including most
revenue producing activities as well as the system of record for accounting and OEM reporting. With multi-location
management ability, dealers receive real-time data with actionable insights to deliver immediate business
improvements. Our DMS products facilitate the sale of new and used vehicles, consumer financing, repair and
maintenance services, and vehicle and parts inventory management.

Complementary to our core DMS, we also provide a portfolio of layered software applications and services to
address the unique needs of automotive retail workflows. In recent years, we have strategically focused on
delivering solutions that solve key pain points for our customers. This includes consolidating technology vendors
within a dealer location and removing friction from the vehicle-buying experience. Specifically, we digitized critical
pieces of the sales process with products such as Connected Store, ELEAD1ONE (“ELEAD”) customer relationship
management (“CRM”), Digital Contracting and eSign. On an as-needed basis, we have also implemented
installation procedures for our DMS and layered application products on a fully remote basis to meet the needs of
our dealers. Our acquisition of Roadster in 2021 provided capabilities to enable dealers to sell new and used vehicles
completely online, while also giving consumers the option to begin and end the vehicle-buying process anywhere
they choose – online or in-store. These solutions are often integrated into and targeted at users of our DMSs, but
may, in some cases, be provided to customers that do not otherwise use our DMS.

We further connect the automotive ecosystem by providing third party retail solution providers with robust and
secure interfaces to the core DMS through our Partner Program. For both automotive retailers and OEMs, we
provide data management and business intelligence solutions through our open Neuron intelligent data platform that
extract, cleanse, normalize, enhance, and distribute billions of pieces of industry information and turn it into usable
data that provides actionable insights and products.

We also offer automotive retailers and OEMs a variety of professional services, custom programming,
consulting, IT solutions, implementation and training solutions, as well as a full range of customer support solutions.

**_Technology_**

To enable end-to-end automotive commerce, our strategy is to invest for the long-term in integrated software
products and an open technology platform that can deliver seamless, workflow-driven solutions for our customers.
The automotive retail market is evolving and demand for new and integrated technology solutions is growing –
consumers increasingly expect a seamless omnichannel experience when purchasing or servicing vehicles; OEMs
see technology as a tool to ensure a consistent and positive customer experience across their retail networks; and
retailers are seeking integrated workflow technology solutions to help them improve both customer satisfaction and
dealership cost structure. We believe that the best way to compete in a world with numerous providers of
unconnected software solutions for numerous automotive retailers, OEMs, consumers, and vehicles is to provide
integrated technology solutions and platform tools that can connect the disparate elements to create continuous retail
workflows.

The DMS is a mission critical central software system that is connected to all aspects of the dealer technology
landscape – it enables the dealers’ day-to-day operations, and the replacement process can be complex.

**Industry Overview**

**_Dealership Consolidation_**

The dealership market in North America has experienced continued consolidation in recent years, with the
larger dealers (i.e. those with three or more dealership rooftops) driving industry growth. According to McKinsey
research, dealers with three or more sites have grown at a CAGR of approximately 1.4% since 2015 while the
overall number of rooftops has increased by approximately 0.1%. We expect this consolidation to continue, with key
trends such as increasing penetration of electric vehicles (“EVs”) and associated larger capital requirements further
accelerating consolidation. According to Bain research, approximately 66% of all automotive dealerships in North
America are expected to be owned by dealers with three or more dealerships by 2026, compared to approximately
50% in 2018.

_Source: Bain._

We believe CDK is well positioned to continue to benefit from dealer consolidation. Larger, more sophisticated
dealers have more complex software requirements and are CDK’s core customer. CDK offers a differentiated
product with ties to OEMs that can be easily adapted to handle the complexities of large dealer groups. In fiscal
2021 approximately 78% of CDK-served dealerships were owned by dealers with three or more rooftops. CDK has
a leading market share among the largest dealers and currently serves more than 60 of the 100 largest dealers in

North America. As dealer consolidation continues, we believe this will drive additional market share gains and
growth in site count.

**_Embedded Economic and Operating Moat and Regulatory Landscape_**

The dealership model benefits from an embedded economic and operating moat. While OEMs are using digital
platforms to optimize the customer journey, dealership networks remain integral to new and used car sales and the
service value chain. Dealers are a cost-efficient distribution method for OEMs, and dealerships remain an essential
part of the customer journey to provide an omnichannel experience. Consumers increasingly research potential
vehicle purchases online, but they still prefer to visit a dealer in order to test drive, complete the purchase and take
delivery. Consumers expect a seamless experience across digital and physical channels. According to research from
Cox Automotive, 72% of customers seek to finalize the deal in-store and 67% of ‘Gen Z’ consumers agree that faceto-face interaction is critical to the purchasing decision. In addition, the dealership acts as part of a nationwide
footprint of service centers for the OEM and helps ensure that a car purchased at one dealer can be serviced by all
dealers under that OEM brand.

The dealership industry also benefits from a favorable regulatory landscape. Every state in the U.S. has
franchise laws that protect existing franchise networks. Specific laws vary on a state-by-state basis but can include:

  - Outright prohibition on OEMs selling directly against their franchisees

  - Requirement for warranty service for vehicles and OEM parts to be provided through the franchise dealers

  - Constraints on ability to terminate franchises, allocate inventory, allocate incentives and impose restrictions
on dealer autonomy

The net impact of these regulations is that major OEMs cannot sell under existing brands except through their
dealer networks and even new entrants face limitations on their ability to sell direct-to-consumer. We believe these
elements create a robust and protective moat around our business.

**_Vehicle Electrification and Future of the Dealer_**

We expect the automotive market to continue its long-term transition to electric vehicles (“EVs”) and believe
this transition will reinforce the growing importance of large auto dealers. We believe CDK, with our focus and
leadership in the large auto dealer segment, is well positioned to capitalize on and benefit from this shift.

According to Bain research, EVs are expected to reach 33% penetration of North American light vehicle sales
by 2030 – gaining share but not significantly displacing internal combustion engine (“ICE”) cars in the next decade.
Given the inertia that exists in the car parc, we expect this will be a gradual but sustaining transition. Incumbent
OEMs are expected to account for the majority of 2030 EV sales at approximately 27% of total light vehicle
production. We also expect OEMs to continue to sell EVs through dealers as the economics and regulatory
limitations have mostly not changed with the advent of newer technologies.

Dealerships will require substantial investment throughout this transition, including building out showrooms
and charging infrastructure and training their salesforce and technicians. We believe this required investment will
serve as a catalyst to further accelerate the consolidation trends within the industry, with the larger, better capitalized
dealers gaining share. As CDK is primarily focused on the largest and most sophisticated dealerships, we believe we
are well positioned to benefit from this trend.

Increasing penetration of EVs is also expected to improve the profit pools of larger dealerships. While EVs
include fewer serviceable parts than ICE cars, the total value of parts for an EV is on average approximately two
times more expensive than ICE cars due to the electrification systems, and more complex servicing requirements
and tooling investment are expected to result in dealers retaining a greater share of servicing from less equipped
third party providers. Higher warranty provisions provided by OEMs on EVs are expected to result in greater
revenue for dealers providing the service.

The OEM and dealer relationship landscape is also evolving. In the current landscape, OEMs have limited
control over pricing and there is a lack of seamless omnichannel experience due to limited OEM-to-dealer
connectivity and inconsistent practices among dealers. New entrants (both OEMs and online retailers) have created
stronger customer experiences, which is forcing OEMs and dealers to compete.

As the evolution continues, we expect OEMs to demand a consistent branded experience (including product
information and centrally managed pricing) and dealers will need to scale to provide a superior guest experience for
new and used car buying and ownership. This will necessitate close collaboration between the OEM and dealers. We
believe dealer consolidation will continue to accelerate and bolster the dealership importance to OEMs – both
parties will focus on providing an omnichannel digital retail sales experience, leading to more efficient inventory
and costs management.

**Our Strengths**

**_Clear market leader across automotive commerce software market_**

CDK has over 40 years of experience designing and implementing mission-critical solutions for automotive
retailers and original equipment manufacturers. We believe our core DMS software is the most comprehensive and
adaptive solution in the market, as evidenced by our having the largest installed base in the industry. We serve
approximately 9,200 auto sites and 6,200 sites across adjacent businesses as of March 31, 2022. Including DMS, our
digital retailing products and CRM standalone applications, we serve approximately 65% of the entire North
American market.

We also have the highest penetration among the largest dealers, which is the fastest growing segment of the
market. As of December 31, 2021 we served 5 of the 10 largest dealers in North America and 60 of the top 100.

To enable seamless, omnichannel, and end-to-end automotive commerce, we believe it is critical to provide
integrated technology solutions and platforms than can connect automotive retailers, OEMs, consumer, and vehicles.
Core to our leadership across automotive commerce is our partnership and presence across all major OEMs.

OEMs see technology as a tool to ensure a consistent and positive customer experience across their retail
networks. We believe OEM technology programs partner with us because of our installed base and differentiated
capabilities. Across the industry, luxury brand dealerships (e.g. BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi) are more often part of
larger, multi-site dealers than domestic brands (e.g. Ford or GM) or Asian brands (e.g. Toyota or Honda). As our
primary customers are larger, multi-site dealers, our penetration of luxury brands is higher than other brand
categories.

(1) Market penetration of dealership sites for each OEM group calculated by weighted avg. share of respective

OEM brands.

We have been able to build our leadership in the industry through organic expansion and investments and
acquisitions, transforming from providing DMS to providing a suite of solutions that allow us to serve as a strategic
partner across OEMs, dealers, consumers, and developers. In fiscal 2021, approximately $540 billion of automotive
commerce transacted through CDK and 55% of all repair orders to dealers in the US utilized CDK systems.

**_Large and growing market with trends playing to CDK’s strengths and delivering new opportunities_**

CDK’s total addressable market (“TAM”) is large, resilient, and growing. Our core DMS software solutions
provide full-service ERP applications to dealers and facilitate the sale of new and used vehicles, consumer
financing, repair and maintenance services, and vehicle and parts inventory management. Complementary to our
core DMS, we also provide broad portfolio of layered software applications and services, data management and
business intelligence solutions, a variety of professional services, and a full range of customer support solutions. Our
open technology platform allows us and third parties to develop adaptive and interchangeable application

7


-----

programming interfaces (“APIs”) that can be used to connect existing technology solutions and build new solutions
reliably and quickly.

We have made these strategic investments and acquisitions to expand our TAM from our core DMS offering to
include all aspects of selling and servicing vehicles as well as data management and business intelligence solutions.
In aggregate, Bain estimates our TAM at over $16 billion as of January 2022.

_Source: Bain._

We believe the markets we serve are also poised to benefit from secular trends within automotive retail,
including EV adoption and dealer consolidation, consumer focus on seamless and omnichannel digital retail, and
increasing value in and complexity of servicing vehicles.

  - EV adoption is accelerating, and we expect this to drive increased dealer consolidation as the capital
investment required and technological complexities will favor larger, more sophisticated, and better
capitalized dealers

  - OEMs, dealers, and consumers are increasingly focused on an omnichannel digital retail sales experience

  - Vehicles are becoming increasingly connected, with OEMs and dealers placing a premium on data
management and interoperability to deliver a modern service experience

  - We believe service is and will continue to be the biggest catalyst of dealer profitability growth, supported
by the EV transition

The automotive retail market is evolving and demand for new and integrated technology solutions is only
growing. As consumers increasingly expect a seamless omnichannel experience, we believe integrated dealer
technology will be essential for OEMs to ensure a consistent and positive customer experience across their retail
networks.

As a provider of solutions for all aspects of operating a dealership, with industry-leading innovative
technologies, a primary focus on larger dealers, and best-in-class software applications and data management, we
believe CDK is poised to capture the robust growth opportunities across our various markets.

**_Deeply embedded, mission critical software solutions driving robust retention rates_**

CDK’s DMS and CRM software solutions are tailored specifically to automotive dealers and are missioncritical to all core operations of a dealership. Our strategy is and has been to invest for the long-term in integrated
software products and an open technology platform that can deliver seamless, end-to-end automotive software
solutions to our customers.

We believe we offer industry-leading software solutions and have cultivated deeply embedded and highly
strategic relationships with both OEMs and dealers over our more than 40 years of year operating history.

We believe our historical retention rates demonstrate the quality of our solutions and strength of our customer
and partner relationships. Since fiscal 2019 we have averaged 95% customer retention based on the number of auto
dealer sites and 100% customer retention based on auto site revenue contribution. In addition, we had an
approximately 92% gross retention rate for the LTM period ended March 31, 2022.

(1) Net revenue retention rate which is calculated by dividing revenue earned in a specific period by the revenue

earned from the same customers in the corresponding period of the previous year. Our calculation of Net
revenue retention rate for a given period only includes revenue from customers that were customers during the
corresponding period of the previous year, and excludes revenue from new business on boarded during the last
12 months.

**_Long-tenured, highly diversified customer base_**

CDK benefits from a large and long-tenured customer base that is highly diversified across both dealers and
OEMs. As of March 31, 2022, we served more than 5,600 customers across automotive and non-automotive end
markets that represented over 15,000 individual dealer sites. Approximately 60% of our DMS sites are in the
automotive end market, with the remaining 40% in adjacency end markets (including heavy trucks, construction

-----

equipment, agricultural equipment, motorcycles, boats and other marine and recreational vehicles). Our primary
focus is on larger, more complex dealers with three or more sites. These dealers represent approximately 80% of
CDK-served dealerships as of March 31, 2022.

Across our entire customer base, the average length of relationship is approximately 20 years, which we believe
demonstrates the quality of our service offerings, value proposition to our customers, and embedded nature of our
solutions within our customers’ sites.

Within our end markets we provide solutions to over 5,600 customers that represent more than 15,000 sites as
of March 31, 2022. Our largest customer accounts for 237 sites and just 4% of revenue, with the top 50 customers
accounting for accounting for 2,087 sites and 27% of revenue. Additionally, less than 10% of our revenue is related
to transactional volumes of car sales. This diversification insulates us from the risk of losing a customer or a
customer experiencing financial distress, as no individual dealer customer represents a material portion of our total
revenue.

Further, our base of automotive customers is also highly diversified by parent manufacturer. For the LTM
period ended March 31, 2022, General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis dealerships represented approximately 16%,
13%, and 12% of revenue, respectively. No other parent manufacturer accounted for greater than 10% of our
revenues. We believe the diversity in brands that we service further insulates our business from the risk of any
individual automotive manufacturer experiencing financial or other distress.

**_Strong subscription revenue growth supported by consistent increases in new dealer sites and penetration of_**
**_layered applications_**

We generate revenue primarily by providing our suite of software and technology solutions under subscriptionbased, SaaS contracts. Our contracts are multi-year with revenue tied to customer site count, not transaction volume,
which provides a recurring revenue stream and stability to our financial performance. In the LTM period ended
March 31, 2022, approximately 78% of our revenue was generated from subscriptions-based contracts.

We have successfully been able to grow our subscription-based revenue through a combination of increasing
the number of dealer sites served and cross selling layered applications to existing DMS customers. We have grown
our number of sites both through organic new dealer wins as well as through the natural flow-through effects of
industry consolidation, whereby our existing larger dealer customers increase their site count. In the last six quarters
through the COVID-19 pandemic we have added 215 total auto dealer sites, bringing our total base to over 9,200.

We have also been successful in cross selling and increasing the penetration of our best-in-class layered
applications with our existing and new DMS customers. These layered applications have been a key driver of our
ability to increase our revenue per site, which has experienced robust growth through the last several quarters.

We have been particularly successful increasing the penetration of our ELEAD, CDK Service, and Roadster
layered applications.

**_Attractive financial model with highly visible and growing recurring revenue, strong profitability and cash flow_**
**_combined with actionable margin improvement initiatives_**

We believe our recurring, subscription-based revenue and highly diversified customer base provide us with a
resilient financial profile. These subscription contracts are multi-year in length, and our high retention rates
historically have provided us with a consistent base of recurring revenue from which to drive organic growth
through adding dealer sites and cross selling layered applications to increase the average revenue per site. In the
LTM period ended March 31, 2022, approximately 78% of our revenue was generated from these subscription
contracts in which revenue is tied to customer site count, not transaction volume. We have consistently grown our
recurring revenue base to over $1.3 billion in the LTM period.

_Note: Recurring revenue refers to revenue generated pursuant to multi-year subscription contracts._

The Company has a high free cash flow conversion rate due to relatively low capex spend and working capital
requirements, providing a stable cash flow profile. The recurring nature of CDK’s revenue has contributed to an
average Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 41% and average free cash flow of $587.3 million over the past
three fiscal years.

We continuously invest in our business and technology which we believe helps us maintain our industry-leading
position and market share. In the last several years we have invested and re-deployed capital into early-stage growth
businesses, increases in corporate overhead and customer support, and technology modernization. These one-time
investments drove a modest compression in Adjusted EBITDA margins from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2021. Including
the impact of identified margin improvement initiatives, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the LTM period ended
March 31, 2022 was $811 million, representing a 46% Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our business also
benefits from relatively low capital expenditure and working capital requirements, which has driven a high Free
Cash Flow Conversion historically between 85% and 89% from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2021.

We have consistently achieved financial results earning status as a Rule of 40 Company, with combined
Adjusted EBITDA margin and revenue growth exceeding 40%.

**_Identified margin improvement initiatives_**

Our management team, together with external advisors and Brookfield, has identified an estimated $146 million
of margin improvement initiatives. Approximately one-third of these initiatives are related to customer operations,
which includes improved utilization of installation delivery teams, increased automation and offshoring, as well as
increasing managerial efficiency and removing redundant layers in targeted areas. Approximately one-third are
related to product and technology, which includes rationalizing resources and geographies, adjusting the DMS
Modernization roadmap and improving managerial efficiency. The remaining margin improvement initiatives are
related to improved productivity within the Sales & Marketing team, increasing General & Administrative
efficiency, and optimizing third party spend. We intend to fully action these initiatives within 24 months of closing
the transaction. Brookfield has a strong track record of successfully delivering on expected cost savings realization
with its other portfolio companies and we believe we will be able to leverage their expertise to implement the cost
savings initiatives.

**_Highly experienced management team with proven track record of operational excellence_**

Our business is led by a highly experienced and qualified management team. Our management team has a
demonstrated track record of delivery value to our stakeholders as a publicly listed company. Our leadership team
have on average over 20 years of industry experience. See “Management.”

**The Transactions**

**_Acquisition_**

On April 7, 2022, Central Parent Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”) formed by affiliates of Brookfield, and
its subsidiary Central Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”), entered into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger (as it may be amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) with CDK Global, Inc., (“CDK”), a
Delaware corporation, pursuant to which Parent agreed to acquire CDK as specified in the Merger Agreement. The
Acquisition is structured as a cash tender offer (the “Equity Tender Offer”) commenced on April 22, 2022 by
Merger Sub to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock of CDK, par value $0.01 per share (the
“Common Stock”), at a price of $54.87 per share, without interest (the “Equity Tender Offer Price”), to the seller in
cash, less any applicable withholding taxes. Following the consummation of the Equity Tender Offer and subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and
into CDK, with CDK continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent,
and with all remaining shares of Common Stock (if any) not owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates
(excluding certain dissenting shares as set forth in the Merger Agreement) canceled and converted into the right to
receive the Equity Tender Offer Price.

Parent will need approximately $8,700.0 million to fund the consideration payable in respect of all of the shares
of the Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement and to refinance $1,790.0 million of existing debt of CDK.
Completion of the Acquisition is subject to various conditions, including, among others, (i) that the number of
shares of Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Equity Tender
Offer, excluding shares of Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet
been “received” (as such term is defined in Section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporate Law, as amended (the
“DGCL”)), together with any shares of Common Stock (if any) owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
affiliates, represents at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock (the “Minimum
Condition”), (ii) the absence of any order, or the enactment of any law, prohibiting the Acquisition, (iii) approvals
and/or termination or expiration of any applicable waiting periods (including any extensions thereof) under the HartScott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”) and the Competition Act (Canada),
R.S.C., 1985, c. C-34HSR Act (the “Competition Act (Canada)”), (iv) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of the parties and compliance by the parties with their respective obligations
under the Merger Agreement, (v) performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the
Merger Agreement and (vi) the absence, since the date of the Merger Agreement, of any fact, event, development or
effect that has had, or would be reasonably expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the
Merger Agreement). In addition, the parties agreed that the expiration of the Equity Tender Offer will not occur
prior to July 1, 2022, as may be extended under certain circumstances. On April 25, 2022, the parties received an
Advance Ruling Certificate from the Canadian Competition Bureau confirming that there would not be sufficient
grounds to apply to the Competition Tribunal for an order under the Competition Act (Canada) to prohibit the
completion of the Transaction. At 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on May 6, 2022, the applicable waiting period under the
HSR Act with respect to the purchase of shares in the Equity Tender Offer expired.

The Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights for both Parent and CDK, including the right of
each party to terminate the Merger Agreement if, other than in certain circumstances described therein, the
Acquisition has not been consummated by October 7, 2022. The Merger Agreement provides that, if any party to the
Merger Agreement fails or refuses to perform any covenant or agreement, the non-breaching party may seek specific
performance of such covenant or agreement, subject to certain restrictions on the ability of CDK to seek specific
performance to enforce Parent’s obligation to provide equity financing. In addition, upon termination of the Merger
Agreement under specified circumstances, Parent may be required to pay CDK a termination fee.

**_Acquisition Financing Transactions_**

On April 20, 2022, CDK announced an offer to purchase for cash any and all of its outstanding 4.500% Senior
Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”), 4.875% Senior Notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) and 5.250% Senior Notes
due 2029 (the “2029 Notes” and together with the 2024 Notes and the 2027 Notes, the “Existing Notes”)
(collectively, the “Debt Tender Offers”). The Debt Tender Offers expire at 5:00 P.M., New York City time, at the

15


-----

end of the day on July 5, 2022 (the “Expiration Date” unless extended or terminated prior to the date any Existing
Notes are accepted for tender). In connection with the Debt Tender Offers, CDK sought consents to the adoption of
proposed amendments to each of the indentures governing the Existing Notes (collectively, the “Existing
Indentures”) to, among other things, eliminate any obligation to make a change of control offer, substantially all of
the other restrictive covenants and certain events of default and other provisions (the “Proposed Amendments”). The
consummation of each Debt Tender Offer is conditioned upon the consummation of the Acquisition and certain
other customary conditions. As of the date of this offering memorandum, for each Debt Tender Offer, consents from
holders of at least a majority of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of each series of the Existing Notes in
such Debt Tender Offer (the “Requisite Consent”) has been received and the supplemental indenture to the
applicable Existing Indenture (each a “Supplemental Indenture”) has been executed; however, the Proposed
Amendments under each such Supplemental Indenture shall become operative only at the time and date at which the
Acquisition is consummated in accordance with the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, any Existing Notes that
remain outstanding will not benefit from any of the restrictive covenants that are eliminated by the adoption of the
Proposed Amendments and will be unsecured obligations of the Issuers, effectively junior in right of payment to all
of the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ existing and future secured senior indebtedness (including the Notes and the New
Credit Facilities) to the extent of the value of the Collateral.

Holders of Existing Notes who validly tendered (and did not validly withdraw) their Existing Notes and validly
delivered (and did not validly revoke) their corresponding consents at or prior to (x) 5:00 P.M., New York City time,
on May 3, 2022 in the case of the 2027 Notes and the 2029 Notes and (y) 5:00 P.M., New York City time, on May 6,
2022 in the case of the 2024 Notes (in each case of (x) and (y), such time and date with respect to a Debt Tender
Offer, the “Consent Time”), and whose Existing Notes are accepted for purchase, will receive consideration equal to
(i) $1,036.25 per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes tendered, (ii) $1,012.50 per $1,000 principal amount of
the 2027 Notes tendered and (iii) $1,012.50 per $1,000 principal amount of the 2029 Notes tendered, in each case,
plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes up to, but not including, the settlement date of the Debt
Tender Offers (the “Debt Tender Offers Settlement Date”), which is expected to promptly follow the Expiration
Date and coincide with the closing of the Acquisition. Holders of Existing Notes who validly tender their Existing
Notes after the applicable Consent Time but on or prior to the Expiration Date, and whose Existing Notes are
accepted for purchase, will receive consideration equal to (i) $1,006.25 per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024
Notes tendered, (ii) $982.50 per $1,000 principal amount of the 2027 Notes tendered and (iii) $982.50 per $1,000
principal amount of the 2029 Notes tendered, in each case, plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing
Notes up to, but not including, the Debt Tender Offers Settlement Date.

We expect to decrease the principal amount of the New Second Lien Credit Facility by the aggregate principal
amount of Existing Notes (if any) that remain outstanding after the Expiration Date. As of the date of this offering
memorandum, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of each series of Existing Notes that were not tendered
and would remain outstanding is approximately (i) $87 million of the 2024 Notes, (ii) $62 million of the 2027 Notes
and (iii) $10 million of the 2029 Notes.

To finance the Acquisition, the Debt Tender Offers and the other transactions related to the Acquisition, we
intend to issue the Notes offered hereby and, concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition, enter into (i) new first
lien credit facilities (the “New First Lien Credit Facilities”), initially consisting of (x) a 7-year $3,600.0 million
equivalent principal amount senior secured U.S. dollar denominated first lien term loan facility (the “New First Lien
Term Loan Facility”) and (y) a 5-year $650.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “New Revolving
Facility”), with no amounts expected to be drawn from the New Revolving Facility at the closing of the Acquisition
and (ii) a new 8-year $865.0 million senior secured U.S. dollar denominated second lien term loan facility (the “New
Second Lien Credit Facility” and together with the New First Lien Credit Facilities, the “New Credit Facilities”)
(which includes an $87.0 million delayed draw portion for the refinancing of 2024 Notes that remain outstanding
after the Expiration Date of the Debt Tender Offers), subject to reduction as noted above. We intend to use the
proceeds of this offering and the borrowings under the New Credit Facilities, together with equity contributions
from funds affiliated with Brookfield, (1) to pay the cash consideration for the Acquisition, (2) to repay all amounts
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of May 24, 2021, among CDK, the borrowing
subsidiaries of CDK party thereto from time to time, the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A. as
administrative agent (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Existing Credit
Facility”), (3) to pay the cash consideration for the Debt Tender Offers, (4) to pay fees and expenses related to the

16

foregoing and (5) for general corporate purposes. See “Use of Proceeds,” “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated
Financial Information” and “The Transactions.” The foregoing financing transactions described in this paragraph are
collectively referred to in this offering memorandum as the “Acquisition Financing Transactions.” The Acquisition,
the Debt Tender Offers and the Acquisition Financing Transactions and the payment of related fees and expenses are
collectively referred to in this offering memorandum as the “Transactions.”

The closing of this offering is not conditioned on consummation of the other Acquisition Financing
Transactions, but release of the proceeds of this offering from the escrow account (as described below) will require,
among other things, that the borrowings under the New Credit Facilities be drawn in connection with the
Acquisition and be available to the Issuers on the date of such release and completion of the Acquisition on such
date. We cannot assure you that such Acquisition Financing Transactions will be completed or, if completed, on
what terms they will be completed. In particular, the terms of our New Credit Facilities are subject to change as we
expect to enter into the New Credit Facilities subsequent to the consummation of this offering.

**Sources and Uses of Funds**

The following table summarizes the estimated sources and uses of proceeds in connection with the
Transactions, assuming the Transactions occurred on March 31, 2022. Actual amounts may vary from estimated
amounts depending on several factors, including, among other things, the date of the closing of the Transactions,
differences from our estimate of fees, expenses and other costs related to the Transactions, differences from our
estimate of our cash and cash equivalents expected immediately prior to the closing of the Acquisition, our working
capital, differences from our estimate of the amount of Existing Notes that will remain outstanding and any changes
made to the sources of the contemplated debt financing, including our New Credit Facilities, and the issue price
thereof. You should read the following together with the information included under the headings “The

(1) Prior to the Escrow Release Date, the Notes will only be guaranteed by Holdings. From and after the Escrow

Release Date, the Notes and the New Credit Facilities will be guaranteed by Holdings. See “Description of

of CDK at a per share price equal to the Equity Tender Offer Price. Following the consummation of the Equity
Tender Offer and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of conditions as set forth in the Merger Agreement,
Merger Sub will be merged with and into CDK, with CDK continuing as the surviving corporation and
becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, an affiliate of Brookfield. See “The Transactions.”

“Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.”

(5) The New Second Lien Facility is expected to have a total borrowing capacity of $865.0 million (which includes

an $87.0 million delayed draw portion for the refinancing of 2024 Notes that remain outstanding after the
Expiration Date of the Debt Tender Offers), subject to reduction by the aggregate principal amount of Existing
Notes (if any) that remain outstanding after the Expiration Date of the Debt Tender Offers. See “Description of

(6) The Existing Notes (if any) that remain outstanding after the Expiration Date of the Debt Tender Offers will not

benefit from any of the restrictive covenants that are eliminated by the adoption of the Proposed Amendments
and will be unsecured obligations of the Co-Issuer.

(7) As of the date of this offering memorandum, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes that

were not tendered and would remain outstanding is approximately $87 million.

(8) As of the date of this offering memorandum, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes that

were not tendered and would remain outstanding is approximately $62 million.

(9) As of the date of this offering memorandum, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of 2029 Notes that

were not tendered and would remain outstanding is approximately $10 million.

(10) None of our subsidiaries organized in jurisdictions outside of the United States will guarantee the Notes. As of

and for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 and the year ended June 30, 2021, our non-guarantor
subsidiaries represented approximately 8% and 8% of our revenues, 9% and 8% of our Adjusted EBITDA and
5% and 5% of our total assets (excluding cash), respectively. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our

(11) From and after the Escrow Release Date, the Notes will be jointly and severally, unconditionally guaranteed by

each of the Issuer’s existing and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that will guarantee the Issuers’
obligations under the New Credit Facilities. We expect that certain of our subsidiaries organized in the United
States will guarantee the Notes from and after the Escrow Release Date. See “Description of Notes—
Guarantees.”

Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special Mandatory

Redemption ............................................................


The Offering of the Notes may be completed prior to
the consummation of the Acquisition. In that case,
upon consummation of the offering of the Notes, the

Release Conditions, the net proceeds will be used as
set forth under “Use of Proceeds.”

If (i) the Escrow Release Conditions are not satisfied
on or prior to the Escrow End Date or (ii) if we notify
the Trustee and the Escrow Agent that the Merger
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its
terms, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory
redemption at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue

21


-----

escrow provisions set forth herein will not be
applicable.


The escrow account will not include additional cash to
fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to holders
of the Notes, which is payable on the interest payment
dates occurring in the period between the issue date of
the Notes and the Escrow End Date or included in the
special mandatory redemption price described above.
In the event that (i) interest is payable on an interest
payment date occurring in the period between the issue
date of the Notes and the Escrow End Date or (ii) the
special mandatory redemption price payable upon a
special mandatory redemption exceeds the amount of
the funds held in the escrow account, the Sponsor will
be required to fund the accrued and unpaid interest
owing to the holders of the Notes, pursuant to
commitments provided by them.

Guarantees ..................................................................... Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the
Notes will not be guaranteed. From and after the
Escrow Release Date, the Notes will be, jointly and
severally, unconditionally guaranteed on a senior
secured first lien basis by each of the Issuer’s existing
and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that
will guarantee the Issuers’ obligations under the New
Credit Facilities. See “Description of Notes—
Guarantees.”

As of and for the nine months ended March 31, 2022
and the year ended June 30, 2021, our non-guarantor
subsidiaries represented approximately 8% and 8% of
our revenues, 9% and 8% of our Adjusted EBITDA
and 5% and 5% of our total assets (excluding cash),
respectively. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Indebtedness and the Notes—Claims of holders of the
Notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of
creditors of certain of our subsidiaries that will not
guarantee the Notes.”


Ranking ......................................................................... Prior to the release of funds from the escrow account
and consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will
be secured by a first-priority security interest in the
escrow account and all deposits and investment
property therein. Following the satisfaction of the
Escrow Release Conditions and the consummation of
the Acquisition, the Notes and the related guarantees
will be the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ senior secured
obligations and will be:



- _pari passu in right of payment to all of the Issuers’_

and the Guarantors’ existing and future senior
indebtedness secured on a first lien basis, including


22


-----

the Issuers’ existing and future borrowings under
the New First Lien Credit Facilities;



                           - effectively senior in right of payment to (i) all of the

Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ existing and future
senior unsecured indebtedness, including the
Existing Notes, to the extent of the value of the
Collateral, and (ii) junior lien indebtedness of the
Issuers and the Guarantors, including the Issuers’
existing and future borrowing under the New
Second Lien Credit Facilities, to the extent of the
value of the Collateral;

                           - senior in right of payment to all of the Issuers’ and

the Guarantors’ existing and future subordinated
indebtedness; and

                           - structurally subordinated to any existing and future

obligations of any subsidiaries of the Issuers that do
not guarantee the Notes.

As of March 31, 2022, on a pro forma basis giving
effect to the Transactions, we would have had
approximately (i) $5,215.0 million of long-term debt
outstanding, the aggregate amount of such
indebtedness that is (x) secured on a first lien basis
would have been approximately $4,350.0 million,
which would rank pari passu to the obligations under
the Notes, (y) secured on a second lien basis would
have been approximately $707.0 million, which would
rank junior in lien priority to the Notes and
(z) unsecured would have been approximately $158.0
million, which would all be effectively junior to the
obligations under the Notes to the extent of the
Collateral and (ii) $650.0 million of additional first
lien borrowing capacity under the New Revolving
Facility (including undrawn letters of credit), subject
to customary conditions.

Collateral ....................................................................... From and after the Escrow Release Date, the Notes
and related guarantees will be secured by first-priority
liens on the Collateral, which consists of substantially
all of the assets that secure the Issuers’ and the
Guarantors’ obligations under the New Credit
Facilities ratably on a pari passu basis with the liens
securing the New First Lien Credit Facilities, subject
to certain exceptions and permitted liens as described
herein. See “Description of Notes—Security for the
Notes.”


In addition, the Collateral will exclude certain
Excluded Assets (as defined under “Description of
Notes”). We will use commercially reasonable efforts
to create and perfect liens on the collateral within 120
days after the Completion Date. For more information


23

on the security granted, see “Description of Notes—
Security for the Notes.”


Intercreditor Agreements ............................................... Upon satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions,
the collateral agent for the Notes (such collateral
agent, the “Notes Collateral Agent” and any collateral
agent holding a security interest for the benefit of the
Notes, an “Applicable Collateral Agent”) will become
a party to an intercreditor agreement (the “First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement”) with the administrative
agent or collateral agent under the New First Lien
Credit Facilities (the “First Lien Credit Agreement
Collateral Agent”) and the other agents party thereto,
setting forth therein the relative rights with respect to
the Collateral (as defined under “Description of
Notes”) and covering certain other matters relating to
the administration of security interests. Pursuant to the
First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the First Lien
Credit Agreement Collateral Agent generally (subject
to a 180-day “standstill period”) controls substantially
all matters related to the Collateral, including with
respect to decisions or enforcement, and may take
actions that the holders of the Notes may disagree with
or that may be contrary to the interests of the holders
of the Notes. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement
will also include waivers of certain important rights
that holders of secured debt would otherwise have.

In addition, the Notes Collateral Agent and the First
Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and the
collateral agent under the New Second Lien Credit
Facility (the “Second Lien Collateral Agent”) will
enter into an intercreditor agreement (the “First
Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement” and,
together with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement,
the “Initial Intercreditor Agreements”), setting forth
therein the relative rights with respect to the Collateral
and covering certain other matters relating to the
administration of security interests. Pursuant to the
First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the
First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent
generally (subject to a “standstill period” not
exceeding 150 days) will control substantially all
matters related to the Collateral, including with respect
to decisions or enforcement with respect to Collateral,
and may take actions that the holders of the Notes may
disagree with or that may be contrary to the interests
of the holders of the Notes. See “Description of
Notes—Security for the Notes—First Lien/Second
Lien Intercreditor Agreement.”

Optional Redemption .................................................... On or after     , 2025 we may redeem the Notes, in
whole or in part, at any time at the redemption prices
described in “Description of Notes—Optional
Redemption.” Prior to such date, we may redeem some

24


-----

or all of the Notes at a redemption price of 100% of
the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus a
“make-whole” premium. In addition, we may redeem
(i) up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of
Notes before     , 2025 with the proceeds of certain
equity offerings at a redemption price of      % of
the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, (ii)
up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the
notes during any 12-month period prior to     ,
2025 at a redemption price of 103% of the principal
amount of the Notes being redeemed and (iii) an
aggregate principal amount of the Notes not to exceed
the proceeds received from any sale of our nonautomotive DMS business line prior to      , 2023
at a redemption price equal to      %, provided that
at least $300.0 million of the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes remains outstanding immediately
after the occurrence of each such redemption (unless
all the Notes are redeemed substantially concurrently),
in each case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Optional
Redemption.”

Change of Control ......................................................... If we experience a Change of Control, we must offer
to repurchase the Notes at 101% of their principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to,
but excluding, the repurchase date. For more details,
see “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option
of Holders—Change of Control.”


Mandatory Offer to Repurchase Following Certain

Asset Sales .............................................................


If we sell certain assets and do not repay certain debt
or reinvest the proceeds of such sales within certain
time periods, we must offer to repurchase the Notes as
described under “Description of Notes—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and
Subsidiary Stock.”

twelve months ended March 31, 2022. The pro forma adjustments to the consolidated pro forma financial data of the
Company are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Further, the
pro forma adjustments are based upon items that are (i) directly attributable to the Transactions, (ii) factually
supportable and (iii) with respect to the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Statement of Operations, expected to
have a continuing impact on the consolidated results. The summary consolidated pro forma financial information is
presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what our financial condition or results of
operations actually would have been had the referenced events occurred on the dates indicated or to project our
financial condition or results of operations as of any future date or for any future period. In addition, the pro forma
net financing charges for the twelve months ended March 31, 2022 presented below were calculated using a
weighted-average estimated blended rate of 6.7%. For additional information, see “Unaudited Pro Forma
Consolidated Financial Information.”

The following information should be read together with the information under the headings “Capitalization,”
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Unaudited Pro
Forma Consolidated Financial Information” and the consolidated financial statements of the Company and related
notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

Ratio of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA

to pro forma net financing
charges(2) ........................................ 2.1x

(1) Pro forma amounts give effect to the Transactions, including the consummation of the Acquisition Financing Transactions.

See “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information” and “Use of Proceeds.”

(2) To provide investors with additional information in connection with our results as determined by GAAP, we disclose

Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin as non-GAAP measures which
management believes provide useful information to investors. Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net
income or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We use Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA Margin as additional measures of the performance of our business.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization less the following: (1) stockbased compensation expense; (2) transaction and integration-related costs; (3) legal and other expenses related to regulatory
and competition matters; (4) business process modernization program; (5) workplace optimization expenses; (6) officer
transition expense and (7) loss on extinguishment of debt. In addition to the preceding adjustments, Adjusted EBITDA
excludes earnings (loss) from equity method investments and adds (without duplication) the pro rata share of EBITDA of
our equity investments, which represents our share of earnings (whether or not distributed) before income tax expense,
depreciation and amortization expense, and interest (income) expense, net of joint ventures and minority investees.

We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about
certain non-cash items and other items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance.

Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for: (1) pre-acquisition EBITDA for
Roadster Inc. (“Roadster”), which we acquired in June 2021, (2) pre-acquisition EBITDA for Salty Dot, Inc. (“Salty”),
which we acquired in October 2021 and (3) margin improvement initiatives.

Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is included to provide additional information to investors about certain adjustments calculated
in a manner consistent with the terms of the instruments that will govern our indebtedness. We believe Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for evaluating our business
performance, liquidity and in evaluating potential acquisitions.

There are material limitations to using Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA does not take into
account certain significant items, including (i) significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service
interest or principal payments, on our debt, (ii) cash requirements for replacing assets, (iii) tax expense or the cash
requirements to pay our taxes, (iv) cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures and (v) all GAAP noncash and non-recurring adjustments. These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the
excluded items independently, and by considering Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with net income as
calculated in accordance with GAAP.

The following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA
to net earnings attributable to CDK, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the periods indicated:

Identified margin improvement initiatives.” Even if we are able to execute the Transactions successfully, this may not
result in the full realization of the cost savings and margin improvements that we currently expect, and therefore, we

31


-----

cannot assure you that any anticipated cost savings and margin improvements will be achieved or that our estimates
and assumptions will prove to be accurate. We will incur costs to execute these margin improvement initiatives that
are not reflected in our estimated cost savings. Actual margin improvements may vary from these estimates, and
although we intend to action these margin improvement initiatives within 24 months of closing of the Transactions,
these initiatives will not be realized in the near-term. See “Risk Factors—We may not realize the anticipated cost
savings and margin improvements from the Transactions.”

Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA (Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA during the LTM Ended March
31, 2022) divided by revenue.

(3) Free Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures and capitalized software. We use Free Cash Flow

to evaluate our ability to generate cash that can be used for working capital requirements, interest expense, repayment of
indebtedness, financing new acquisitions and for continued re-investment in our business.

Free Cash Flow Conversion is defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA.

**RISK FACTORS**

_Any investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described_
_below and all of the information contained in this offering memorandum before deciding whether to purchase the_
_Notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional_
_risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially and_
_adversely affect our business. If any of those risks actually occurs, our business, cash flows, financial condition and_
_results of operations would suffer. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements and our_
_actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See “Cautionary_
_Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this offering memorandum._

**Risks Relating to Our Business**

**_The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has materially affected how we and our customers are operating our_**
**_businesses, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our business, results of operations, and_**
**_financial condition remains uncertain._**

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. The
COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our market and the global economy. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,
many of our dealer customers experienced significant declines in new and used vehicle unit sales and sales of their
finance and insurance products, particularly during the first and second quarters of 2020. While our underlying
business has remained strong during the COVID-19 pandemic due to our subscription-based business model, the
pace of improvements in the public health situation, evolving global response measures and corresponding impacts
on the automotive retail industry remain fluid and uncertain and may lead to sudden changes in trajectory and
outlook. Accordingly, we are currently unable to quantify the full and long-term impact of the pandemic on our
results of operations and financial position.

We are monitoring the global outbreak of COVID-19 and have taken steps to mitigate its risks by working with
our customers and employees. To support our customers during the pandemic, we offered financial and other
assistance during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and added product benefits to facilitate remote delivery and
touchless transactions. The direct financial impact of these concessions was a near-term decrease in cash receipts
and a reduction in revenue that will be recognized over fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022. A discussion of the impact of
these factors is provided in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.”

To support our employees, we temporarily closed offices globally and implemented certain travel restrictions.
This work-from-home operating environment has caused strain for, and may adversely impact the productivity of,
certain employees, and these conditions may persist and harm our business, including our future operating results.
Additionally, our efforts to re-open our offices safely may not be successful, could expose our employees,
customers, and partners to health risks, and us to associated liability, and will involve additional financial burdens.
The pandemic may have long-term effects on the nature of the office environment and remote working, and this may
present operational challenges that may adversely affect our business.

Furthermore, the pandemic has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries,
including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates. Due to the unprecedented and sustained social and economic
consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy generally, there is uncertainty around its duration
and the timing of recovery. The ultimate significance of the COVID-19 pandemic, including any measures to reduce
its spread, on our business will depend on events that are beyond our control and that we cannot predict and could
have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Risk Factors section,
which could in turn have a material adverse effect on us.

**_We face intense competition. If we do not continue to respond quickly to technological developments or_**
**_customers’ shifting technological requirements or to compete effectively against other providers of technology_**
**_solutions to automotive retailers, OEMs, and other participants in the automotive retail industry, it could have_**
**_a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition._**

Competition among automotive retail solutions providers is intense. The industry is highly fragmented and
subject to rapidly evolving technology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new solutions. We
have a variety of competitors both for our integrated solutions and for each of our individual solutions. For our DMS
solutions, our principal competitors are Reynolds and Reynolds, Dealertrack (Cox Automotive), Auto/Mate, Tekion,
AutoSoft, PBS Systems and various local and regional providers.

Key elements of our business strategy are to strengthen and extend our solutions through intelligence and
innovation and to develop and deliver our next generation of solutions. However, our competitors may be able to
respond more quickly or effectively to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer demands or to devote
greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their solutions than we can to ours. Moreover, we may
not be successful in responding to these forces and enhancing our products on a timely basis, and any enhancements
we develop may not adequately address the changing needs of our customers. We expect the industry to continue to
attract new competitors and new technologies, possibly involving alternative technologies that are more
sophisticated and cost-effective than our solutions. These competitive pressures may require us to reduce our
pricing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors
or that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, and financial condition.

**_Market trends influencing the automotive retail industry could have a negative impact on our business, results_**
**_of operations, and financial condition._**

Market trends that negatively impact the automotive retail industry may affect our business by reducing the
number and/or size of actual or potential customers or the money that actual or potential customers are willing or
able to spend on our solution portfolio. Such market factors include:

  - the adverse effect of long-term wage stagnation on the purchasing power of vehicle purchasers and the
number of vehicle purchasers;

  - pricing and purchase incentives for vehicles;

  - disruption in the available inventory of vehicles;

  - disruption in the franchised automotive retailer dealership model, including potential disintermediation by
emerging business models;

  - reductions in growth or decreases of automotive retailer spend on technology;

  - contractions in the number of franchised automotive retailers;

  - market supply of vehicles and fluctuations in used-vehicle pricing;

  - the expectation that consumers will be purchasing fewer vehicles overall during their lifetime as a result of
better quality vehicles and longer warranties and the development of shared-use mobility;

  - the cost of gasoline and other forms of energy;

  - the availability and cost of credit to finance the purchase of vehicles and excess negative equity in existing
vehicle loans;

  - the effect of adverse macroeconomic conditions on consumer shopping activity;

  - increased federal and other taxation; and

34


-----

  - reductions in business and consumer confidence.

Such market trends could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial
condition.

**_Market acceptance of and influence over our products and services is concentrated in a limited number of_**
**_automobile OEMs and consolidated retailer groups, and we may not be able to maintain or grow these_**
**_relationships._**

Although the automotive retail industry is fragmented, a relatively small number of OEMs, consolidated retailer
groups and retailer associations exert significant influence over the market acceptance of automotive retail products
and services due to their concentrated purchasing activity, their endorsement or recommendation of specific
products and services and/or their ability to define technical standards and certifications. For example, our DMSs are
certified to technical standards established by OEMs and certain of our products and services are provided pursuant
to OEM-designated endorsement or preferred vendor programs. While automotive retailers are generally free to
purchase the solutions of their choosing, when an OEM has endorsed or certified a provider of products or services
to its associated franchised automotive retailers and if our solutions lack such certification or endorsement, adoption
or retention of our products and services among the franchised dealers of such OEM could be materially impaired.

**_We may be unable to develop and bring products and services in development to market or bring new products_**
**_and services to market in a timely manner or at all._**

Our success depends in part upon our ability to bring to market new products and services, and enhancements
thereto that address evolving customer demands. The successful development of Fortellis, for example, is important
to our strategy. The time, expense, and effort associated with developing and offering Fortellis, and other new and
enhanced products and services may be greater than anticipated. The length of the development cycle varies
depending on the nature and complexity of the product, the availability of development, product management, and
other internal resources and the role, if any, of strategic partners. If we are unable to develop and bring to market
additional products and services, and enhancements thereto, in a timely manner, or at all, we could lose market share
to competitors who are able to offer these new products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

**_Our failure or inability to execute any element of our business strategy could negatively impact our business,_**
**_results of operations, or financial condition._**

Our business, results of operations, and financial condition depend on our ability to execute our business
strategy, which includes the following key elements:

  - deepening relationships with our existing customer base;

  - continuing to expand our customer base;

  - delivering on our business process modernization initiatives;

  - strengthening and extending our solutions through intelligence and innovation;

  - developing and delivering our next generation of solutions;

  - selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions; and

  - building and maintaining a culture of performance and accountability.

We may not succeed in implementing a portion or all of our business strategy, and even if we do succeed, our
strategy may not have the favorable impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition that we
anticipate. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our business or achieve the rapid execution
necessary to fully avail ourselves of the market opportunity for our solution portfolio. If we are unable to adequately

35

implement our business strategy, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could suffer a material
adverse effect.

**_We are dependent on our key management, direct sales force, and technical personnel for continued success._**

Our global senior management team is concentrated in a small number of key members, and our future success
depends to a meaningful extent on the services of our executive officers and other key team members, including
members of our direct sales force and technology staff. Generally, our executive officers and employees can
terminate their employment relationship at any time. The loss of any key employees or our inability to attract or
retain other qualified personnel could materially harm our business and prospects.

Effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Disruptions in future leadership transitions
or reorganizations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition
and could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain other key executives.

Competition for qualified leadership and technical personnel in the technology industry is intense, and we
compete for leadership and technical personnel with other technology companies that have greater financial and
other resources than we do. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate
highly qualified leadership and technical personnel, and there can be no assurance that we are able to do so. Any
difficulty in hiring or retaining needed personnel, or increased costs related thereto, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

**_Real or perceived errors or failures in our software and systems could negatively impact our results of_**
**_operations and growth prospects._**

We depend upon the sustained and uninterrupted performance of numerous proprietary and third-party
technologies to deliver our solution portfolio. If one or more of those technologies cannot scale to meet demand, or
if there are human or technological errors in our execution of any feature or functionality using any such
technologies, then our business may be harmed. Because our software is often complex, undetected errors and
failures may occur, especially when new versions or updates are made. Despite testing by us, errors or bugs in our
solutions may not be found until the software or service is in active use by us or our customers. Moreover, our
customers could incorrectly implement or inadvertently misuse our solutions, which could result in customer
dissatisfaction and adversely impact the perceived utility of our solutions as well as our brand. Any of these real or
perceived errors, failures, or bugs could result in negative publicity, reputational harm, loss of or delay in market
acceptance of our solutions, loss of competitive position or claims by customers for losses sustained by them, all of
which, along with the costs of responding to such effects, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations, and financial condition.

**_Cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or_**
**_damage to our reputation._**

We handle substantial amounts of confidential information, including personal information of our employees
and of our customers’ consumers and employees. Our success depends on the confidence of OEMs, dealers, lenders,
major credit reporting agencies and other data providers, and other users of (or participants in) our solutions, in our
ability to store, process, and transmit this confidential information securely (whether over the internet or otherwise),
and to operate our computer systems and operations without significant disruption or failure.

Our computer systems experience cyber-attacks and data security incidents of varying degrees on a regular
basis. These events may lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse, or
theft of data that we store, process and transmit. Our security measures may also fail to prevent unauthorized access
to our systems and data may be exfiltrated and improperly disclosed or used due to employee error, malfeasance,
system errors, or vulnerabilities, including vulnerabilities of our vendors, suppliers, their products, or otherwise.
While security measures are in place, if our security measures fail to prevent unauthorized access to such data, our
solutions may be perceived as not being secure and our customers may curtail or stop using our solutions and/or
vendors may curtail or stop providing their solutions to us. Any failure of, or lack of confidence, in the security of
our solutions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

36


-----

Despite our focus on data security, we may not be able to stop unauthorized attempts to gain access to data that
we store and process, or to stop disruptions in the transmission or provision of data and communications or other
data by us. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other events or
developments could result in a compromise or breach of the controls used by our solutions to protect data contained,
processed in and transferred to or from our, our customers’ and/or our vendors’ databases. While warranties and
liabilities are usually limited in our customer and vendor contracts, they or other third parties may seek to hold us
liable for any losses suffered as a result of unauthorized access to their confidential information or non-public
personal information of consumers. In addition, while effort has been expanded to have insurance to cover these
losses, we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against or alleviate any
problems caused by actual or threatened cyber-attacks or other unauthorized access to such data. Our security
measures may not be sufficient to prevent security breaches, and any failure to prevent the improper use and
disclosure of data and/or to adequately alleviate any problems caused by such improper use and disclosure could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Our customers, vendors and other partners are primarily responsible for the security of their information
technology systems, and we rely on them to supply clean data content and/or to utilize our products and services in a
secure manner. While we provide guidance and specific requirements of data security in some cases, we do not
directly control any of such parties’ cyber security programs and operations. If our customers, vendors and other
partners fail to prevent any significant cyber security breaches, their businesses could be disrupted which may
negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

**_Interruption or failure of our networks, systems, and infrastructure could hurt our ability to effectively provide_**
**_our products and services, which could damage our reputation and/or subject us to litigation or contractual_**
**_penalties._**

The availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our network and systems.
From time to time, we have experienced, and may experience in the future, network or system slowdowns and
interruptions. These network and system slowdowns and interruptions may interfere with our ability to do business.
While the appropriate upgrades to various systems, shoring up backup processes, and other measures to protect
against data loss and system failures have been implemented and tested, there is still risk that we may lose critical
data or experience network failures.

Despite the resiliency plans we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a
disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses. This may include a disruption involving electrical,
satellite, undersea cable or other communications, internet, cloud computing, transportation, or other services
facilities used by us or third parties with which we conduct business. These disruptions may occur as a result of
events that affect only our buildings or systems or those of such third parties, or as a result of events with a broader
impact globally, regionally or in the cities where those buildings or systems are located, including, but not limited,
to natural disasters, war, civil unrest, economic or political developments, pandemics, and weather events. Such
network, system or infrastructure failures or disruptions could result in lengthy interruptions in our service and lost
revenue opportunities for our customers, which could result in litigation against us and/or our customers may curtail
or stop using our solutions or vendors may curtail or stop providing their solutions to us. Additionally, we have
service level agreements with certain of our customers that may result in penalties or trigger cancellation rights in
the event of a network or system slowdown or interruption. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, and financial condition.

**_Our business operations may be harmed by events beyond our control._**

Our business operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, such as fires, floods,
earthquakes, hurricanes, and pandemics or outbreaks of disease or similar public health concerns, such as the
COVID-19 pandemic (discussed further in “—The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has materially affected how we
and our customers are operating our businesses, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our business,
results of operations, and financial condition remains uncertain,” above), or fears of such events, or from power
outages, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, computer network service outages and disruptions, “denial of
service” attacks, computer malware and ransomware, break-ins, sabotage, employee error or malfeasance, and other
similar events beyond our control. The occurrence of any such event at any of our facilities or at any third-party
facility utilized by us or our third-party providers could cause interruptions or delays in our business, loss of data, or

37


-----

could render us unable to provide our solution portfolio. In addition, any failure of a third-party to provide the data,
products, services, or facilities required by us, as a result of human error, bankruptcy, natural disaster, or other
operational disruption, could cause interruptions to our computer systems and operations. The occurrence of any of
these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

**_We utilize certain key technologies, data, and services from, and integrate certain of our solutions with, third_**
**_parties and may be unable to replace those technologies, data, and services if they become obsolete,_**
**_unavailable, or incompatible with our solutions._**

We utilize certain key technologies and data from, and/or integrate certain of our solutions with, hardware,
software, services, and data of third parties, including Chrome Systems, TrueCar, Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, EMC,
Cisco Systems, Kyocera, Experian, Equifax, TransUnion and others. Some of these vendors are also our competitors
in various respects. These third-party vendors could, in the future, seek to charge us cost-prohibitive fees for such
use or integration or may design or utilize their solutions in a manner that makes it more difficult for us to continue
to utilize their solutions, or integrate their technologies with our solutions, in the same manner or at all. Any
significant interruption in the supply or maintenance of such third-party hardware, software, services, or data could
negatively impact our ability to offer our solutions unless and until we replace the functionality provided by this
third-party hardware, software, and/or data. In addition, we are dependent upon these third parties’ ability to
enhance their current products, develop new products on a timely and cost-effective basis, and respond to emerging
industry standards and other technological changes. There can be no assurance that we would be able to replace the
functionality or data provided by third-party vendors in the event that such technologies or data becomes obsolete or
incompatible with future versions of our solutions or are otherwise not adequately maintained or updated. Any delay
in or inability to replace any such functionality could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, and financial condition. Furthermore, delays in the release of new and upgraded versions of third-party
software applications could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial
condition.

**_We are currently, and expect to be in the future, involved in litigation that is expensive and time consuming_**
**_and, if resolved adversely, that may materially adversely affect us._**

From time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings, including patent, copyright,
commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower, antitrust and other litigation and claims, in
addition to governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming,
divert management’s attention and resources, cause us to incur significant expenses or liability and/or require us to
change our business practices. Because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from
time to time, settle disputes, even where we have meritorious claims or defenses, by agreeing to settlement
agreements. We are currently a defendant in two purported class action lawsuits that set forth allegations of anticompetitive conduct and anti-competitive agreements between the Company and Reynolds and Reynolds relating to
the manner in which the defendants control access to, and allow integration with, their respective DMSs. Any
negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or
undesirable changes to our products or business practices, and accordingly our business, results of operations, or
financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Although the results of such lawsuits and claims
cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters relating to the manner
in which we control access to, and allow integration with, our DMS that we currently face will have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We believe these cases are without merit
and intend to continue to contest the claims in these cases vigorously.

Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, there can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be
obtained in all our cases, and we cannot assure that the results of any of these actions will not have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. For more information
regarding the litigation in which we are currently involved, see the information set forth in “Note 18–Commitments
and Contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**_We may be unable to adequately protect, and we may incur significant costs in defending, our intellectual_**
**_property and other proprietary rights._**

Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
We rely upon a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent and unfair competition laws, as well as
license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by requiring certain of our
team members and consultants to enter confidentiality, non-competition and assignment of inventions agreements.
To the extent that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties
might gain access to our proprietary information, develop and market products and services similar to ours or use
trademarks similar to ours. Existing U.S. federal and state intellectual property laws offer only limited protection. If
we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the
intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive, and
we may not prevail. The failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, or
manage costs associated with enforcing those rights, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, and financial condition.

**_Claims that we or our technologies infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third_**
**_party may require us to incur significant costs, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, or develop or license_**
**_substitute technology._**

We have in the past and may in the future be subject to claims that our technologies in our products and services
infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third party. In addition, the vendors providing
us with technology that we use in our own technology could become subject to similar infringement claims.
Although we believe that our products and services do not infringe any intellectual property or other proprietary
rights, we cannot assure that our products and services do not, or that they will not in the future, infringe intellectual
property or other proprietary rights held by others. Any claims of infringement could cause us to incur substantial
costs defending against the claim, even if the claim is without merit, and could distract our management from our
business. Moreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from the claim could require us to pay substantial
amounts, obtain a license to continue to use the products and services that are the subject of the claim, and/or
otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a
license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, from the third party asserting any particular claim, that we
would be able to successfully develop alternative technology on a timely basis, if at all, or that we would be able to
obtain a license from another provider of suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering, and our
customers to continue using, the products and services. In addition, we generally provide in our customer
agreements for certain products and services that we will indemnify our customers against third-party infringement
claims relating to technology that we provide to those customers, which could obligate us to pay damages if the
products and services were ever found to be infringing. Infringement claims asserted against us, our vendors, or our
customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

**_We have made strategic acquisitions and formed strategic alliances in the past and expect to do so in the_**
**_future. If we are unable to find suitable acquisitions or alliance partners that strengthen our value proposition_**
**_to customers or to achieve the expected benefits from such acquisitions or alliances, there could be a material_**
**_adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition._**

We have historically pursued growth through acquisitions, ranging from acquisitions of small start-up
companies that provide a discrete application to a handful of customers, to acquisitions of substantial companies
with more mature solutions and a larger customer base, such as our acquisition of ELEAD in 2018, which supports
our CRM business. As part of our ongoing business strategy to expand solutions offerings, acquire new
technologies, and strengthen our value proposition to customers, we frequently engage in discussions with third
parties regarding, and enter into agreements relating to, possible acquisitions, strategic alliances, and joint ventures.
However, there may be significant competition for acquisition, alliance, and joint venture targets in our industry, or
we may not be able to identify suitable candidates, negotiate attractive terms, or obtain necessary regulatory
approvals for such transactions in the future. Acquisitions, strategic alliances, and joint ventures also involve
numerous other risks, including potential exposure to assumed litigation and unknown environmental and other
liabilities, as well as undetected internal control, regulatory or other issues, or additional costs not anticipated at the
time the transaction was approved or completed.

39


-----

Even if we are able to complete acquisitions or enter into alliances and joint ventures that we believe will
provide attractive growth opportunities, such transactions are inherently risky. Significant risks from these
transactions include risks relating to:

  - integration and restructuring costs, both one-time and ongoing;

  - developing and maintaining sufficient controls, policies, and procedures;

  - diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business operations;

  - establishing new informational, operational, and financial systems to meet the needs of our business;

  - losing key employees, customers, and vendors;

  - failing to achieve anticipated synergies, including with respect to complementary solutions; and

  - unanticipated or unknown liabilities.

If we are not successful in completing acquisitions in the future, we may be required to reevaluate our
acquisition strategy. We also may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources
in seeking to complete acquisitions. In addition, we could use substantial portions of our available cash to pay all or
a portion of the purchase prices of future acquisitions. If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of our
acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by our management and financial or industry analysts, others may
not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as we do. If these risks materialize, there could be a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Our future acquisitions may involve the issuance of our equity securities as payment, in part or in full, for the
business or assets acquired, which would dilute our existing stockholders’ ownership interests. Future acquisitions
may also decrease our earnings and the benefits derived by us from an acquisition might not outweigh or exceed the
dilutive effect of the acquisition. We also may incur additional indebtedness, issue equity, have future impairment of
assets or suffer adverse tax and accounting consequences in connection with any future acquisitions.

**_We could be liable for contract or product liability claims, and disputes over such claims may disrupt our_**
**_business, divert management’s attention, or have a negative impact on our financial results._**

We provide limited warranties to purchasers of our products and services. In addition, errors, defects or other
performance problems in our products and services, including with respect to data that we store, process and provide
in connection with our products and services, could result in financial or other damages to our customers or
consumers. There can be no assurance that any limitations of liability set forth in our contracts would be enforceable
or would otherwise protect us from liability for damages. We maintain general liability insurance coverage,
including coverage for errors and omissions in excess of the applicable deductible amount; however, there can be no
assurance that this coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms, in sufficient amounts to cover one or
more large claims or at all, or that the insurer will not deny coverage for any future claim. The successful assertion
of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in
our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance
requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Furthermore, any litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial cost to us and divert management’s
attention from our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and
financial condition. In addition, some of our products and services are business-critical for our customers, and a
failure or inability to meet a customer’s expectations could seriously damage our reputation and negatively impact
our ability to retain existing business or attract new business.

**_If our customers fail to renew subscriptions in accordance with our expectations, our future revenue and_**
**_operating results could suffer._**

We generate revenue primarily by providing a broad suite of subscription-based software and technology
solutions. A large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscription-based

40


-----

products and services and new sales of such products and services, both to new and existing clients. Our customers
have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription
period, and customers may not renew their subscriptions at the same or higher level of service or for the same
duration of time, if at all. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to accurately predict future
customer renewal rates.

Our customers’ renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of
satisfaction with our services or the services of third-parties working on our behalf, our ability to continue enhancing
features and functionality, the reliability (including uptime) of our subscription offerings, the prices of offerings and
those offered by our competitors, the actual or perceived information security of our systems and services, decreases
in the size of our customer base, reductions in our customers’ spending levels or declines in customer activity as a
result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
If our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue will be
adversely affected.

**_Because we recognize a majority of our revenue from our subscription-based products and services over the_**
**_term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our_**
**_operating results._**

We generally recognize a majority of our revenue from sales of our subscription-based products and services
ratably over the term of the subscription contract. As a result, the majority of our quarterly revenue is attributable to
service contracts entered into during previous quarters. A decline in new or renewed service agreements in any one
quarter will not be fully reflected in our revenue in that quarter but will harm our revenue in future quarters.
Consequently, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our subscription services in a
particular quarter may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. Our subscription model also
makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, because revenue from
new subscription contracts, and from additional orders under existing subscription contracts, must be recognized
over the applicable subscription term. In addition, delays or failures in deployment of our subscription services may
prevent us from recognizing subscription revenue for indeterminate periods of time. Further, we may experience
unanticipated increases in costs associated with providing our subscription services to customers over the term of
our subscription contracts as a result of inaccurate internal cost projections or other factors, which may harm our
operating results.

**_We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in research and development efforts for new and existing_**
**_products and technologies and technical sales support. Such investments may affect our operating results, and,_**
**_if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect, our revenue and operating_**
**_results may suffer._**

We have invested and expect to continue to invest in research and development for new and existing products,
technologies and services in response to our customers’ increasing technological requirements. Such investments
may be in related areas, such as technical sales support, and may include increases in employee headcount. These
investments may involve significant time, risks and uncertainties, including the risk that the expenses associated
with these investments may affect our margins and operating results and that such investments may not generate
sufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments. We believe that
we must continue to invest a significant amount of time and resources in our research and development efforts and
technical sales support to maintain and improve our competitive position. If we do not achieve the benefits
anticipated from these investments, if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, or if customers reduce or slow
the need to upgrade or enhance their computational software products and design flows, our revenue and operating
results may be adversely affected.

**_There can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us or at all._**

From time to time we may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing.
Although we believe that the sources of capital currently in place will permit us to finance our operations for the

41


-----

foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions, our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable
terms and conditions in the future or at all will be impacted by many factors, including, but not limited to:

  - our financial performance;

  - our credit ratings;

  - the liquidity of the overall capital markets; and

  - the state of the economy.

There can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us or at all.

**Risks Relating to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters**

**_Our business is directly and indirectly subject to, and impacted by, extensive and complex laws and regulations_**
**_in the U.S. and abroad, and new laws and regulations and/or changes to existing laws and regulations, as well_**
**_as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government action, may negatively impact our_**
**_business, results of operations, and financial condition._**

Our business is directly and indirectly subject to, and impacted by, numerous U.S. and foreign laws and
regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. Compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and
regulations that apply to our operations increases our costs and may impede our competitiveness. In addition, failure
to comply with such laws or regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our ability to do business in
applicable jurisdictions or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines or exposure to civil
litigation. New regulations and/or changes to existing regulations could require us to modify our business practices,
including modify the manner in which we contract with or provide products and services to our customers; directly
or indirectly limit how much we can charge for our services; require us to invest additional time and resources to
comply with such regulations; or limit our ability to update our existing products and services, or require us to
develop new ones.

In addition to the data privacy and security laws and regulations mentioned below, our business is also directly
or indirectly governed by various laws and regulations relating to issues such as information services,
telecommunications, antitrust or competition, employment, motor vehicle and manufacturer licensing or franchising,
vehicle registration, advertising, taxation, consumer protection, and accessibility. We must also comply with anticorruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In addition, motor vehicle and manufacturer
licensing, franchising and advertising is highly regulated at the state level and is subject to changing legislative,
regulatory, political, and other influences. Such state laws are complex and subject to frequent change. The
application of this framework of laws and regulations to our business is complex and, in many instances, is unclear
or unsettled, which in turn increases our cost of doing business, may interfere with our ability to offer our solutions
competitively in one or more jurisdictions and may expose us and our employees to potential fines, penalties, or
other enforcement actions. In some cases, our customers may seek to impose additional requirements on our
business in efforts to comply with their interpretation of their own or our legal obligations. These requirements may
differ significantly from our existing solutions or processes and may require engineering and other costly resources
to accommodate.

In addition, we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, actions,
and audits from regulatory authorities, particularly in the area of competition. On June 22, 2017, we received from
the FTC a Civil Investigative Demand consisting of interrogatories and a request to produce documents relating to
any agreements between the Company and Reynolds and Reynolds. On April 22, 2019, we received a subsequent
request to schedule interviews with certain current and former Company employees. Parallel document requests
have been received from certain states’ Attorneys General. We have responded to the requests and no proceedings
have been instituted. At this time, we do not have sufficient information to predict the outcome of, or the cost of
resolving these investigations.

These laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government
actions, may be costly to comply with and may delay or impede the development of new products, result in negative

42


-----

publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to
remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing
business practices. Our failure to comply, or to provide solutions that allow our customers to comply, or any new
investments of additional time and resources necessary to comply, or to provide solutions that allow our customers
to comply, with any of the foregoing laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, and financial condition.

**_We are subject to new regulations that restrict the manner and extent to which we can control access to our_**
**_DMS and other software applications and limit what, if anything, we may charge for integration with those_**
**_applications._**

Revenue from the Partner Program is dependent on the business model of charging third party retail solution
providers for integration to our DMS through a program of robust and secure interfaces. Our ability to control the
manner in which we provide this robust and secure access to information in our systems, and our pricing model for
this service, has been, and will likely continue to be, challenged, dictated and constrained in certain jurisdictions.
For example, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, Arizona, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon passed
legislation that requires us to provide access or integrations to our software to read or write data in our systems. The
legislation in some of these states purports to impose such requirements on us at our cost and without markup, or
even without compensation, to any third party designated by a dealer licensee of our software, regardless of whether
the dealer licensee has title to the data on our systems or the right under its software license to authorize nonlicensee third parties access to our systems. In addition, each statute imposes administrative and technical
requirements that are inconsistent with our current solutions and capabilities. We believe that compliance with such
legislation will impair our ability to provide our customers with robust and secure technology solutions and will
increase our risk of data security and privacy breaches, system and data integrity problems, and associated adverse
competitive, financial, operational, and reputational impacts. Similar legislation has been proposed in other states
and additional states may consider or pass similar legislation. We may incur significant legal and regulatory
expenses in connection with assessing or challenging the applicability of this legislation to our products and
offerings and while we seek legal, regulatory, or policy solutions to address concerns with respect to the validity of
the legislation or our ability to comply with it. Ultimately, our failure to comply, or to provide solutions that allow
our customers to comply, or any new investments of additional time and resources necessary to comply, or to
provide solutions that allow our customers to comply, with this legislation will increase our operating costs and
reduce our revenue, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial
condition.

**_Our business is directly or indirectly subject to, or impacted by, complex and rapidly evolving U.S. and foreign_**
**_laws and regulation regarding privacy and data protection. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to_**
**_change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims, adjustments to our business practices,_**
**_penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in customer growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our_**
**_business._**

Many U.S. and foreign jurisdictions have passed, or are currently contemplating, a variety of consumer
protection, privacy, and data security laws and regulations that may relate directly or indirectly to our business. For
example, federal laws and regulations governing privacy and security of consumer information generally apply to
our customers and/or to us as a service provider. These include, but are not limited to, the federal Fair Credit
Reporting Act, the GLB Act and regulations implementing its information safeguarding requirements, the Junk Fax
Prevention Act of 2005, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (the
“CAN-SPAM Act”), the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Do-Not-Call-Implementation Act, applicable
Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) telemarketing rules (including the declaratory ruling affirming
the blocking of unwanted robocalls), the FTC Privacy Rule, Safeguards Rule, Consumer Report Information
Disposal Rule, Telemarketing Sales Rule, Risk-Based Pricing Rule, Red Flags Rule, and California Consumer
Privacy Act of 2018. Laws of foreign jurisdictions, such as Canada’s Anti-Spam Law and Personal Information
Protection and Electronic Documents Act, and European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”)
similarly apply to our collection, processing, storage, use, and transmission of protected data.

In the U.S., some state laws and regulations have imposed, and others have contemplated imposing, enhanced
disclosure obligations and greater restrictions or prohibitions on the use of data than are already contained in federal
laws such as the GLB Act and its implementing regulations or the FTC rules described above. For example, a new

43


-----

law in California, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), went into effect on January 1, 2020.
CCPA provides California consumers with a greater level of transparency and broader rights and choices with
respect to their personal information than those contained in any existing state and federal laws in the U.S. The
“personal information” regulated by CCPA is broadly defined to include any information that identifies or is
reasonably capable of being associated with or linked, directly or indirectly, with a California consumer or
household, including, for example, demographics, usage, transactions and inquiries, preferences, inferences drawn to
create a profile about a consumer. Compliance with CCPA requires the implementation of a series of operational
measures such as preparing data maps, inventories, or other records of all personal information pertaining to
California residents, households and devices, as well as information sources, usage, storage, and sharing,
maintaining and updating detailed disclosures in privacy policies, establishing mechanisms to respond to consumers’
data access, deletion, portability, and opt-out requests, etc. Violations of CCPA will result in civil penalties up to
$7,500 per violation. CCPA further allows consumers to file lawsuits against a business if a data breach has
occurred as a result of the business’ violation of the duty to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures
and practices.

The enforcement of the CCPA commenced on July 1, 2020. In the meantime, significant uncertainties in the
interpretation and application some key CCPA provisions remain outstanding. On June 2, 2020, the California
Attorney General submitted the draft of the implementation regulations to the CCPA (“CCPA Regulations”) to the
California Office of Administration Law for its final approval. Furthermore, the privacy group whose efforts led to
the CCPA in 2018 has proposed a new law, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which, if passed, would
replace the CCPA and impose further compliance burdens and risks on service providers such as us.

To comply with CCPA and assist many of our customers who are subject to CCPA to comply with CCPA, we
have modified or adjusted the design, development, and delivery of our products and services in a significant way.
However, with further clarifications and interpretations of the CCPA, the approval of the CCPA Regulations, and
the passage of the CPRA and/or any new laws and regulations, additional modifications and adjustments may be
required, which may result in significant costs and expenses, and any delay or failure to make such changes may
negatively affect our customers’ confidence in or perception of our product and services, result in their ceasing to
use our products or services or even lawsuits and significant liabilities.

In addition, all 50 states have passed data breach notification laws that require notifications to affected
consumers, attorneys general, consumer protection agencies and/or other government authorities when there is a
breach of personal data, and provide consumers with credit monitoring and other remedies. Any data breaches and
the related notifications and remedies may result in significant compliance costs in addition to potential liability and
reputational damage.

The costs and other burdens of compliance with privacy and data security laws and regulations could negatively
impact the use and adoption of our solutions and reduce overall demand for them. Additionally, evolving concerns
regarding data privacy may cause our customers, or their customers and potential customers, to resist providing the
data necessary to allow us to deliver our solutions effectively. Even the perception that personal information is not
satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our solutions and any failure
to comply with such laws and regulations could lead to significant fines, penalties, or other liabilities. Any such
decrease in demand or incurred fines, penalties, or other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, and financial condition.

**_Changes in, or interpretations of, accounting principles may negatively impact our financial position and_**
**_results of operations._**

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These principles are subject to
interpretation by the SEC and other organizations that develop and interpret accounting principles. New accounting
principles arise regularly, implementation of which can have a significant effect on and may increase the volatility
of our reported operating results and may even retroactively affect previously reported operating results. In addition,
the implementation of new accounting principles may require significant changes to our customer and vendor
contracts, business processes, accounting systems, and internal controls over financial reporting. The costs and
effects of these changes could adversely impact our operating results, and difficulties in implementing new
accounting principles could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.

**_We may have exposure to unanticipated tax liabilities, which could harm our business, results of operations,_**
**_and financial condition._**

Our business operations subject us to income taxes and non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various
foreign jurisdictions. The computation of the provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities is complex, as it is
based on the laws of numerous taxing jurisdictions and requires significant judgment regarding the application of
complicated rules governing accounting for tax provisions under GAAP. The provision for income taxes may
require forecasts of effective tax rates for the year, which include assumptions and forward looking financial
projections, including the expectations of profit and loss by jurisdiction. Various items cannot be accurately
forecasted and future events may materially differ from our forecasts. Our provision for income tax could be
materially impacted by a number of factors, including changes in the geographical mix of our profits and losses,
changes in our business, such as internal restructuring and acquisitions, changes in tax laws and accounting guidance
and other regulatory, legislative or judicial developments, tax audit determinations, changes in our uncertain tax
positions, changes in our intent and ability to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings, changes in our ability to utilize
foreign tax credits, changes to our transfer pricing practices, tax deductions associated with stock-based
compensation, and changes in our need for deferred tax valuation allowances. Any changes in corporate income tax
laws or any implementation of tax laws relating to corporate tax reform, could significantly impact our overall tax
liability. For these reasons, our actual tax liabilities in a future period may be materially different than our income
tax provision.

In addition, changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. In
the event that changes in tax laws negatively impact our effective tax rates, our provision for taxes, or generate
unanticipated tax liabilities, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could suffer a material
adverse effect.

**_Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition._**

The income and non-income tax regimes we are subject to or operate under are unsettled and may be subject to
significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could
materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. For example, changes to U.S. tax laws enacted in
December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 and beyond.

**Risks Related to the Transactions**

**_Our historical and pro forma financial information may not be representative of our results as an independent_**
**_company._**

Prior to the Acquisition, we were an independent public company. Our historical audited and unaudited interim
financial information does not reflect the significant impact of the Transactions on us. The unaudited pro forma
financial data presented in this offering memorandum is based in part on certain assumptions regarding the
Transactions that we believe are reasonable. We cannot assure you that our assumptions will prove to be accurate
over time. Accordingly, the historical, pro forma and other financial information included in this offering
memorandum may not reflect what our results of operations and financial condition would have been had we been a
private entity during the periods presented, or what our results of operations and financial condition will be in the
future.

**_We may not realize the anticipated cost savings and margin improvements from the Transactions._**

The benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the Transactions will depend, in part, on our ability to
realize anticipated cost savings and margin improvements. After giving effect to the Acquisition, we believe that we
will be able to, among other matters, save on our costs by being able to better focus our financial and operational
resources on our business, growth profile and strategic priorities. We plan on introducing processes and tools to
improve the efficiency in operations through rigorous measurement and managing demand for employee time, as
well as prioritizing our spend on research and development to projects with strong returns on investment.

Even if we are able to execute the Transactions successfully, this may not result in the full realization of the cost
savings and margin improvements that we currently expect, either within the expected time frame, or at all. In

45


-----

addition, we cannot assure you that the costs to achieve these cost savings and margin improvements will not be
higher than we anticipated or that the decrease in costs will not result in adverse effects to our business. Therefore,
we cannot assure you that any anticipated cost savings and margin improvements will be achieved or that our
estimates and assumptions will prove to be accurate. Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect the significant costs we expect to incur in order to achieve such cost
savings and margin improvements, and there can be no assurance that such costs will not be materially higher than
presently contemplated, as such costs are difficult to estimate accurately. If our cost savings and/or margin
improvements are less than our estimates or our cost saving and margin improvement initiatives adversely affect our
business or cost more or take longer to implement than we project, or if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our
results could be lower than we anticipate.

**_We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant transaction costs in connection with the_**
**_Transactions._**

In connection with the Transactions, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs and
expenses, including financial advisory, legal, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees and expenses,
reorganization and restructuring costs, severance and employee benefit-related expenses, printing expenses and
other related charges. In addition, we may incur significant one-time charges as a result of costs associated with the
Transactions. We will not be able to quantify the exact amount of these charges or the period in which they will be
incurred until after the Transactions are completed. The timing of the completion of the Transactions will affect the
costs associated with the Transactions. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred in
connection with the Transactions, there are many factors that could affect the total amount or timing of the
integration and implementation expenses. There may also be additional unanticipated significant costs in connection
with the Transactions that we do not anticipate and may not be able to recoup. These costs and expenses could
reduce the benefits and income we expect to achieve from the Transactions.

**_Affiliates of Brookfield will control us and their interests may conflict with us, our customers or the holders of_**
**_the Notes in the future._**

Following the consummation of the Acquisition, Brookfield will, indirectly, control substantially all of our
voting equity. As a result, Brookfield will have control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction,
regardless of whether the holders of Notes believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. For
example, Brookfield could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of our indebtedness, including
secured indebtedness, or to sell assets, which may impair our ability to make payments under the Notes. In addition,
to the extent permitted by the indenture that will govern the Notes and the credit agreement that will govern our
New Credit Facilities, Brookfield may cause us to pay dividends rather than make capital expenditures or otherwise
use our funds for the benefit of our business.

In addition, Brookfield is in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time,
acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Brookfield may vote in a manner
so as to restrict us from expanding our business or entering into additional lines of business which may be related to
the current or future operations of these investments. Also, Brookfield may pursue acquisitions that may be
complementary with our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.
Furthermore, certain of our current or potential future customers may believe the interests of Brookfield conflict
with theirs which may impact our ability to attract and retain certain customers. So long as Brookfield continues to
indirectly own a significant amount of our outstanding voting equity, even if such amount is less than 50%, they will
continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.

**_In connection with the consummation of the Acquisition, we will delist the Company’s common stock and_**
**_deregister under the Securities Act, and the Company will no longer be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of_**
**_2002._**

Following the consummation of the Acquisition, we will delist the Company’s common stock and deregister
under the Securities Act, and because we will not register the new notes under the Securities Act after this offering,
we are no longer, and will not be, subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires public companies to
have and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures to ensure timely disclosure of material information,

46


-----

and have management review the effectiveness of those controls on a quarterly basis. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also
requires public companies to have and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements, and have
management review the effectiveness of those controls on an annual basis (and have the independent auditor attest to
the effectiveness of such internal controls). We are not required to comply with these requirements and therefore we
may not have comparable procedures in place as compared to other public companies.

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes**

**_We will have a substantial amount of indebtedness and this substantial level of indebtedness could materially_**
**_adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash to fulfill our obligations under such indebtedness, to_**
**_react to changes in our business and to incur additional indebtedness to fund future needs._**

As of March 31, 2022, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had
approximately $5,215.0 million of long-term debt outstanding, and approximately $650.0 million of additional first
lien borrowing capacity under the New Revolving Facility (including undrawn letters of credit), subject to
customary conditions. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information.” Our substantial
indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have important
consequences for our business, including, but not limited to:

  - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to plan for and respond to, general adverse
economic and industry conditions and changes in our business and the competitive environment;

  - an increasingly substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to making payments
of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of funds that would
otherwise be available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, share
repurchases or other corporate purposes;

  - increasing our vulnerability to further downgrades of our credit rating, which could adversely affect our
interest rates on existing indebtedness, cost of additional indebtedness, liquidity and access to capital
markets;

  - restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;

  - requiring us to secure our credit agreements and other indebtedness and provide subsidiary guarantees if
certain conditions are met;

  - making it more difficult for us to repay, refinance or satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt;

  - limiting or eliminating our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital
expenditures, acquisitions, or other purposes; and

  - any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments could result in an event of default
under the agreements governing such indebtedness, which in turn, if not cured or waived, could result in
the acceleration of the applicable debt, and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a
cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies.

Our ability to service our current and future levels of indebtedness will depend upon, among other things, our
future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, including the
interest rate environment, and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our
control.

There is no assurance that we will generate cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings
will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs and we may be forced to take
actions such as reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling
assets, restructuring or refinancing debt, reducing or discontinuing dividends we may pay in the future, or seeking
additional equity capital. These actions may not be effected on satisfactory terms, or at all. Any inability to generate

47


-----

sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, and financial condition.

**_High levels of indebtedness and debt service obligations will effectively reduce the amount of funds available_**
**_for other business purposes and may adversely affect us._**

Interest costs related to our indebtedness will be substantial, and our higher level of indebtedness, including any
future borrowings, could reduce funds available for acquisitions, capital expenditures or other business purposes,
impact our credit ratings, restrict our financial and operating flexibility or create competitive disadvantages
compared to other companies with lower debt levels.

Further, a higher level of indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect
to our debt, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions and limit our ability to obtain
additional financing.

Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends upon
our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and other
factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate
sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements, we may
be required, among other things:

  - to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;

  - to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;

  - to sell selected assets or businesses; or

  - to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures.

Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements. In
addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or
at all.

**_The credit agreements that will govern the New Credit Facilities and the indenture that will govern the Notes_**
**_will each impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries, which_**
**_may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities._**

The credit agreements that will govern the New Credit Facilities and the indenture that will govern the Notes
will each impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions will limit our ability and
the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:

  - incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;

  - pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;

  - make certain investments;

  - incur certain liens;

  - enter into transactions with affiliates;

  - merge or consolidate;

  - enter into certain negative pledge agreements;

  - designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries;

  - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

48


-----

  - and transfer or sell assets.

In addition, we will be required to comply with, based on level of utilization of the New Revolving Facility, a
leverage-based financial maintenance covenant under the New Revolving Facility. See “Description of Certain
Other Indebtedness.”

As a result of the restrictions described above, we will be limited as to how we conduct our business and we
may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new
business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail
to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.

Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our indebtedness
incurred in connection with the Transactions and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could
result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these
borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot
refinance these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

**_Despite our indebtedness levels on the closing date after giving effect to the Transactions, we and our_**
**_subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks_**
**_associated with our substantial leverage._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the
credit agreements that will govern the New Credit Facilities and the indenture that will govern the Notes will contain
restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are expected to be subject to a number of
qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness that may be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could
be substantial. If we incur additional debt above the levels that will be in effect on the closing date after giving effect
to this offering, the risks associated with our leverage, including those described above, would increase. As of
March 31, 2022, on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had approximately $650.0
million of additional first lien borrowing capacity under the New Revolving Facility (including undrawn letters of
credit), subject to customary conditions, reduced by the amount of any letters of credit to be issued under such
facilities on the closing date of the Acquisition or thereafter), which may be drawn after the closing date. In addition,
the restrictions in the indenture that will govern the Notes and the credit agreements that will govern the New Credit
Facilities will not prevent us from incurring obligations, such as trade payables, that do not constitute indebtedness
as defined in such debt instruments.

**_We may be unable to service our indebtedness, including the Notes, which could result in our bankruptcy or_**
**_liquidation._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on
and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional
economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors, all of which are beyond our control, including the
availability of financing in the international banking and capital markets. Lower net revenues generally will reduce
our cash flow. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that
future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt, including the
Notes, to refinance our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. After giving effect to the Transactions, some of our
debt, including the New Revolving Facility, will mature before the maturity dates of the Notes.

If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to
restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, which could cause us to default on our debt
obligations and impair our liquidity. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of
the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher
interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business
operations.

If we fail to comply with the covenants under the New Credit Facilities, we could become in default thereunder,
and by reason of cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, other indebtedness may then become immediately

49


-----

due and payable. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the
required lenders under each of our New Credit Facilities to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under
our New Credit Facilities and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this
occurs, we would be in default under our New Credit Facilities. Moreover, in the event of a default, the holders of
our indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and
unpaid interest, if any. The lenders under each of our New Revolving Facility could also elect to terminate their
commitments thereunder, cease making further loans, and institute foreclosure or other enforcement proceedings
against their collateral if applicable. The lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be
forced into a bankruptcy, liquidation or other insolvency proceeding.

**_Repayment of our debt, including required principal and interest payments on the Notes, is dependent on cash_**
**_flow generated by our subsidiaries, which may be subject to limitations beyond our control._**

Our subsidiaries own all of our assets and conduct all of our operations. Accordingly, repayment of our
indebtedness, including the Notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and (if they are
not Guarantors of the Notes) their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or
otherwise.

Unless they are the Guarantors of the Notes, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on
the Notes or to make funds available to the Issuers or the Guarantor subsidiaries for that purpose. Our non-guarantor
subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions or repay intercompany loans to
enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes. Each non-guarantor subsidiary is a
distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to
obtain cash from our non-guarantor subsidiaries. While the indenture that will govern the Notes will limit the ability
of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other
intercompany payments to the Issuers, these limitations will be subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. The
indenture that will govern the Notes and the credit agreements that will govern the New Credit Facilities will not
limit the ability of our non-guarantor unrestricted subsidiaries to incur any additional consensual restrictions on their
ability to make any such payments to the Issuers. Our non-guarantor unrestricted subsidiaries will be able to engage
in many of the activities that we and our restricted subsidiaries, subject to the restrictive covenants in the indenture
that will govern the Notes, that will be prohibited or limited from doing under the terms of the credit agreements or
the indenture that will govern the Notes. These actions could be detrimental to our ability to make payments of
principal and interest under the Notes when due and to comply with our other obligations under the Notes and could
reduce the amount of our assets that would be available to satisfy your claims should we default on the Notes.

In the event that we are unable to receive distributions from subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required
principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes.

**_Interest rate fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial_**
**_condition and cash flows._**

Indebtedness under the New Credit Facilities will bear interest at variable rates. Because we will have
substantial variable rate debt, fluctuations in interest rates may affect our business, results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness
would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including
cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. We may attempt to minimize interest
rate risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily
interest rate swaps. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate
indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. After giving effect to the
Transactions, we expect to have approximately $4,307.0 million aggregate principal amount of variable rate
indebtedness.

**_Claims of holders of the Notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of certain of our_**
**_subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes._**

The Notes will not be guaranteed by certain of our existing and future subsidiaries. Only our existing whollyowned domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness of the Issuers under the New Credit Facilities

50


-----

will guarantee the Notes upon consummation of the Acquisition. As of the closing date of the Acquisition, none of
our foreign subsidiaries, our non-wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries or our unrestricted subsidiaries will guarantee
the Notes, and no such subsidiaries are expected to guarantee the Notes in the future. As of and for the nine months
ended March 31, 2022 and the year ended June 30, 2021, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately
8% and 8% of our revenues, 9% and 8% of our Adjusted EBITDA and 5% and 5% of our total assets (excluding
cash), respectively. In addition, the guarantee of certain Guarantors will be released in connection with a transfer of
such Guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture that will govern the Notes or upon certain other
events described in “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” The indenture that will govern the Notes will permit these
non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur certain additional debt and will not limit their ability to incur other liabilities that
are not considered indebtedness thereunder.

**_We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control._**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of
Holders—Change of Control”), we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at 101% of their
principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the purchase date. Additionally, under the
terms of the New Credit Facilities, a change of control may constitute an event of default that permits the lenders to
accelerate the maturity of borrowings under the respective agreements and terminate their commitments to lend. The
source of funds for any purchase of the Notes and repayment of borrowings under the New Credit Facilities would
be our available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations or other sources, including borrowings,
sales of assets or sales of equity. We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control because we
may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the debt securities that are tendered upon a change of
control and repay our other indebtedness that will become due. We may require additional financing from third
parties to fund any such purchases, and we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Further,
our ability to repurchase the Notes may be limited by law. In order to avoid the obligations to repurchase the Notes
and events of default and potential breaches of the terms of the New Credit Facilities, we may have to avoid certain
change of control transactions that would otherwise be beneficial to us.

**_Applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance laws may permit a court to avoid the Notes or the guarantees,_**
**_and if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Notes._**

Federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of the Notes, the
incurrence of the guarantees of the Notes and the granting of related liens. Under federal bankruptcy law and
comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the Notes
or the guarantees thereof and related liens could be avoided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if an Issuer or a
Guarantor, as applicable, (i) issued the Notes, incurred its guarantee or granted related liens with the intent of
hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (ii) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair
consideration in return for either issuing the Notes or incurring the guarantee or granting related liens and, in the
case of (ii) only, one of the following is also true at the time thereof:

  - such Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance
of the Notes, the incurrence of its guarantees or the granting of related liens;

  - the issuance of the Notes, the incurrence of its guarantees or the granting of related liens left such Issuer or
such Guarantor, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on the
business;

  - such Issuer or such Guarantor intended to, or believed that it would, incur indebtedness beyond its ability to
pay as they mature; or

  - such Issuer or such Guarantor was a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for
money damages docketed against it if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation,
property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A court would likely find that a Guarantor
did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee to the extent the Guarantor did not
obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes or related Liens.

51


-----

We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not any Issuer or any
Guarantor was insolvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, whether the Notes or the
guarantees would be subordinated to other indebtedness. In general, however, a court would deem an entity
insolvent if:

  - the sum of its indebtedness, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair
saleable value of all of its assets;

  - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing indebtedness, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and
mature; or

  - it could not pay its indebtedness as it becomes due.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes, the incurrence of a guarantee or the granting of related
liens was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other reviewable transaction, the court could avoid the payment
obligations under the Notes or that guarantee or any related liens, could subordinate the Notes or that guarantee to
presently existing and future indebtedness of the relevant Issuer or of the relevant Guarantor or could require the
holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or that guarantee. In the event of a
finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other reviewable transaction occurred, you may not receive any
repayment on the Notes or the benefit of any related liens. The indenture that will govern the Notes will also permit
guarantees by foreign subsidiaries, if applicable, to be limited to the extent necessary to comply with applicable
local law, and these limitations could limit the value of the guarantees. Further, the avoidance of the Notes could
result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other indebtedness that could result in
acceleration of that indebtedness.

Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes to other
claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (i) the holder of Notes
engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (ii) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or
conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of Notes and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. Similar limitations could apply in other jurisdictions.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the guarantees will be_**
**_released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the guarantees of the Notes will be released automatically. The guarantee of a
Guarantor of the Notes will be automatically released to the extent such Guarantor is released in connection with a
sale or other disposition of the equity interests of such Guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture that
will govern the Notes.

The indenture will also permit us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries that is a Guarantor of
the Notes as an unrestricted subsidiary, which will result in the guarantee of such Guarantor being automatically
released. If a Guarantor is released from its guarantee of the New First Lien Credit Facilities and certain other
indebtedness of the Issuers or any other Guarantor, other than in connection with a refinancing of the New First Lien
Credit Facilities and such other indebtedness or a payment under such guarantee, or a Guarantor ceases to be a
subsidiary as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge or security interest securing the secured indebtedness, such
subsidiary’s guarantee of the Notes will be automatically released as well, in which case any liens on the assets of
such subsidiary in favor of the New First Lien Credit Facilities will also be released. If the guarantee of any
Guarantor is released, no holder of the Notes will have a claim as a creditor against that subsidiary, and the
indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables and preferred stock, if any, whether secured or
unsecured, of that subsidiary will be structurally senior to the claim of any holders of the Notes. For a description of
all circumstances in which a Guarantor’s subsidiary guarantee will be automatically released, see “Description of
Notes—Guarantees.”

**_Changes in our credit rating or the rating of the Notes could negatively impact the market price or liquidity of_**
**_the Notes._**

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us. Credit
rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their credit ratings for us based on their
overall view of our industry. We cannot be sure that credit rating agencies will maintain their ratings on the Notes. A
negative change in our ratings could have a negative impact on the future trading prices of the Notes and on our
ability to obtain future debt financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

In addition, we currently expect that, upon issuance, the Notes will be rated by Standard & Poor’s Investors
Ratings Service, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Inc.. A rating agency’s rating of the Notes is not
a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any particular security, including the Notes. Such ratings are limited in
scope and do not comment as to material risks relating to an investment in the Notes. An explanation of the
significance of such rating may be obtained from such rating agency. There is no assurance that such credit ratings
will be issued or remain in effect for any given period of time. Rating agencies also may lower, suspend or withdraw
ratings on the Notes or our other debt in the future. Holders of the Notes will have no recourse against us or any
other parties in the event of a change in or suspension or withdrawal of such ratings. Any lowering, suspension or
withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market prices or marketability of the Notes.

**_Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to registration rights and we do not currently intend to register the_**
**_Notes under the applicable securities laws, and, therefore, there are significant restrictions on your ability to_**
**_transfer or resell the Notes._**

The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the Notes only in a transaction registered under
or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. We are not
required to and do not intend to register the Notes for resale under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any
other jurisdiction and we are not required to and do not intend to offer to exchange the Notes for notes registered
under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, you may have difficulty
transferring your Notes, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time.
See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_We will not be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (except to the extent we are required to do so as a_**
**_subsidiary of Brookfield Business Partners following consummation of the Acquisition)._**

Since we will not register the Notes under the Securities Act after this offering and we will cease being a public
company upon consummation of the Acquisition, we will not be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (except
to the extent we are required to do so as a subsidiary of Brookfield Business Partners following consummation of the
Acquisition), which requires public companies to have and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures to
ensure timely disclosure of material information, and have management review the effectiveness of those controls
on a quarterly basis. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires public companies to have and maintain effective internal
controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
preparation of financial statements, and have management review the effectiveness of those controls on an annual
basis (and have the independent auditor attest to the effectiveness of such internal controls). We therefore may not
have comparable procedures in place as compared to public companies.

**_The indenture that will govern the Notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and will not be_**
**_required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act._**

The indenture that will govern the Notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and will not be
required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. Therefore, holders of the Notes will not be
entitled to the benefit of the provisions and protection of the Trust Indenture Act except to the extent there are
similar provisions in the indenture that will govern the Notes.

53

**_Your ability to transfer the Notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and an active_**
**_trading market may not be maintained for the Notes._**

We expect the Notes to be eligible for trading by “qualified institutional buyers,” as defined under Rule 144A
(each a “QIB”), but we do not intend to list the Notes on any national securities exchange or include the Notes in
any automated quotation system. The initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the
Notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. However, the initial purchasers are not obligated to make a
market in the Notes, and they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. Therefore,
an active market for the Notes may not develop or be maintained, which would adversely affect the market price and
liquidity of the Notes. In that case, the holders of the Notes may not be able to sell their Notes at a particular time or
at a favorable price.

Even if an active trading market for the Notes does develop, there is no guarantee that it will continue.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to severe disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The market, if any, for the Notes may experience
similar disruptions, and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the prices at which
you may sell your Notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the Notes may trade at a discount from
their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance
and other factors.

In addition, recent regulatory actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Rule 15c2-11 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, may restrict the ability of brokers and dealers to publish quotations
on the Notes on any interdealer quotation system or other quotation medium after January 3, 2023, which may
materially affect the liquidity and trading prices for the Notes.

**_Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the Notes will not apply during any period in which the_**
**_Notes are rated investment grade._**

Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the Notes will not apply to us during any period in
which the Notes are rated investment grade by any of Standard & Poor’s Investors Ratings Services, Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings, Inc. provided at such time no default or event of default has occurred and is
continuing. These covenants restrict, among other things, our ability to pay distributions, incur indebtedness and
enter into certain other transactions. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever be rated investment grade, or
that if they are rated investment grade, that the Notes will maintain these ratings. However, suspension of these
covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were
in force. To the extent the covenants are subsequently reinstated, any such actions taken while the covenants were
suspended would not result in an event of default under the indenture that will govern the Notes. See “Description of
Notes—Certain Covenants.”

**_If the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Escrow End Date, the Acquisition is terminated at any_**
**_time prior thereto, or other conditions to the release of the escrowed proceeds of this offering are not satisfied,_**
**_the Notes will be subject to special mandatory redemption, and as a result, you may not obtain the return you_**
**_expect on the Notes._**

Upon consummation of the offering of the Notes, unless the closing of the Acquisition has occurred at or prior
to such time, we will deposit the gross proceeds of the offering into segregated escrow accounts. Such amounts will
remain in escrow until either (i) the Acquisition is consummated and certain other conditions are met or (ii) the
escrowed funds are released in connection with a special mandatory redemption of the Notes. If the Escrow Release
Conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Escrow End Date, if we notify the Trustee and the Escrow Agent that
the Merger Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms or upon the occurrence of certain other
events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. The special mandatory redemption price will be
equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from the issue date of
the Notes, up to, but not including, the date of such special mandatory redemption. Upon such redemption, you may
not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in an investment that yields comparable returns. In
addition, if you purchase the Notes at a price greater than the price at which the Notes are redeemed, you may suffer
a loss on your investment.

54


-----

The ability of holders of the Notes to realize such funds may be subject to certain bankruptcy and insolvency
law limitations in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Issuers. In addition, the escrowed funds will only
be in the amount of the gross proceeds received from the offering of the Notes, and will not be sufficient to pay the
special mandatory redemption amount which includes accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the
redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

**_If a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding is commenced, bankruptcy or insolvency laws may prevent the_**
**_release of the escrowed funds._**

If an Issuer or any Guarantor commences a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, or one is commenced against
an Issuer or any Guarantor while amounts remain in the escrow accounts described under “Description of Notes—
Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws may prevent
the Escrow Agent from releasing the escrowed funds or applying those funds for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes. The court adjudicating that case might find that such escrow accounts are the property of the bankruptcy
estate. The automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and other insolvency laws generally prohibit secured
creditors from foreclosing or realizing upon or disposing of a debtor’s property without court approval. As a result,
holders of the Notes may not be able to have the escrow funds applied at the time or in the manner contemplated by
the indenture that will govern the Notes and could suffer a loss as a result.

**_Between the time of the issuance of the Notes and the consummation of the Acquisition, the parties to the_**
**_Merger Agreement may agree to modify or waive the terms or conditions of such document without consent of_**
**_the holders of the Notes._**

Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the parties to the Merger Agreement may agree to make
amendments or waivers of the terms thereof. The escrow agreement will not preclude the Acquisition parties from
making certain changes to the terms of the Acquisition or from waiving conditions to the Acquisition, including
certain changes in the purchase price or to the structure of the Acquisition.

**_The terms and conditions of the new credit facilities have not been finalized._**

The credit agreements relating to the New Credit Facilities have not been finalized. Our entry into New Credit
Facilities are subject to market conditions, and we cannot assure you that the New Credit Facilities will be
completed in the manner, on the terms or on the timetable described herein, or at all. We may elect to increase the
amount of our New First Lien Term Loan Facility, which would increase the amount of secured indebtedness.
Future changes in market conditions may result in less favorable terms for the New Credit Facilities and any
changes to the terms of the New Credit Facilities may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our
business. The terms of the New Credit Facilities could also change in a way that makes it easier to incur debt in the
future.

**Risks Related to the Collateral**

**_Even though the holders of the Notes will benefit from first-priority liens on the Collateral, the representative_**
**_of the lenders under the New First Lien Credit Facilities will initially have the exclusive right to control actions_**
**_(including the exercise of remedies) (or to direct the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent to do the_**
**_same) with respect to the Collateral._**

The rights of the holders of the Notes in the Collateral (including the right to exercise remedies) will be subject
to (i) the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement among the Credit Agreement Administrative Agent, the Notes
Collateral Agent, the Trustee and any applicable representative for the holders of future pari passu obligations and
(ii) the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement among the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, the
Notes Collateral Agent, the Second Lien Collateral Agent and any applicable representative for the holders of future
secured obligations.

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to the Collateral,
including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the Collateral or to control
such proceedings, will be at the direction of the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent until the earlier to
occur of (x) the discharge of our obligations under the New First Lien Credit Facilities (which discharge does not

55


-----

include certain refinancings of the New First Lien Credit Facilities) and (y) 180 days after the occurrence of a
continuing event of default under the New First Lien Credit Facilities or the agreement governing the series of
indebtedness representing the largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness subject to the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement and the acceleration of such indebtedness (subject to certain other requirements), unless (1)
the Applicable Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to
all or a material portion of Collateral or (2) the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Guarantor that has granted a security
interest in such Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding. See “Description of Notes—Security for the Notes—First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.”

Under the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, no action may be taken by the Second Lien
Collateral Agent or any other Second Lien Secured Party (as defined under “Description of Notes”) with respect to
the Collateral until the earlier to occur of (x) the discharge of our obligations under the Notes and the New First Lien
Credit Facilities (which discharge includes certain refinancings of the Notes and the New First Lien Credit
Facilities) and (y) a period of no more than 150 days elapsing since the date on which the Applicable Collateral
Agent (as defined under “Description of Notes”) has received written notice from the applicable Second Lien
Representative (as defined under “Description of Notes”) of the existence of any event of default under the
applicable Second Lien Documents (as defined under “Description of Notes”) for the series of indebtedness that is
controlling under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement that is continuing and the written demand by the applicable
Second Lien Representative of the immediate payment in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or
otherwise) of all of the obligations in respect of such series of indebtedness so long as such event of default has not
been cured or waived (which period shall be tolled or terminated in certain circumstances and which shall not expire
so long as the Applicable Collateral Agent is diligently pursuing the exercise of its rights and remedies against the
pledgors or all or a material portion of the Collateral and given a prompt notice of such exercise to the Second Lien
Collateral Agent).

At any time that the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent does not have the right to take action with
respect to the Collateral pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement as described above, then the authorized
representative for the series of other first lien debt that has the greatest outstanding principal amount would exercise
such right to take action under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor
Agreement.

The foregoing is not a summary of all material terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the First
Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement. For a more detailed description, see “Description of Notes—Security for
the Notes—First Lien Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of Notes —Security for the Notes—First
Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement.”

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, none of the Notes Collateral Agent, Trustee or the holders of the
Notes may object following the filing of a bankruptcy petition or commencement of any other insolvency,
restructuring or liquidation proceeding to (i) any proposed debtor-in-possession financing or to the use of cash
collateral that is not opposed or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or (ii) the use of the Collateral to
secure debtor in possession financing, subject to certain specified conditions and limited exceptions. After the filing
of any bankruptcy petition or the commencement of any other insolvency, restructuring or liquidation proceeding,
the value of the Collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the Notes would be prohibited from raising an
objection to such proposed financing or use of cash collateral. For a description of important waivers by holders of
the Notes and limits on their rights as secured creditors under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement see
“Description of Notes—Security for the Notes—First Lien Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of Notes—
Security for the Notes—First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement.”

**_Additional indebtedness is secured by the Collateral that will secure the Notes, and the Notes will be secured_**
**_only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been granted as security for the Notes and the guarantees,_**
**_which may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes._**

The Notes will be secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral and there may not be sufficient collateral to
pay all or any of the Notes. In addition, indebtedness permitted to be secured by a lien that is pari passu with liens
securing the Notes, including the New First Lien Credit Facilities (referred to herein as other “Additional Pari Passu
Obligations”), is secured by the same tangible and intangible assets comprising the Collateral securing the Notes, on
a pari passu basis. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding against

56


-----

us or any Guarantor, the Collateral securing the other Additional Pari Passu Obligations and the Notes must be used
to pay the other Additional Pari Passu Obligations and the Notes ratably as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement. We may incur additional Additional Pari Passu Obligations in the future.

As of March 31, 2022, on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had approximately
(i) $5,215.0 million of long-term debt outstanding, (ii) the aggregate amount of such indebtedness that is secured on
a (x) first lien basis would have been approximately $4,350.0 million, which would rank pari passu to the
obligations under the Notes and (y) second lien basis would have been approximately $707.0 million, which would
rank junior in lien priority to the obligations under the Notes and (iii) $650.0 million of additional borrowing
capacity under the New Revolving Facility (including undrawn letters of credit), subject to customary conditions.

Any additional obligations secured by an equal priority lien on the Collateral securing the Notes will adversely
affect the relative position of the holders of the Notes with respect to the Collateral securing such Notes.

No appraisals of any collateral have been prepared in connection with the offering of the Notes. The value of
the Collateral at any time will depend on market and other economic conditions, including the availability of
suitable buyers for the Collateral. By their nature, some or all of the pledged assets may be illiquid and may have no
readily ascertainable market value. The value of the Collateral securing the Notes could be impaired in the future as
a result of changing economic conditions, our failure to implement our business strategy, competition and other
future events or trends. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, no assurance can
be given that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral securing the Notes will be sufficient to pay
our obligations under the Notes, in full or at all, while also paying the Additional Pari Passu Obligations.

In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding against us or any
Guarantor, all proceeds from the Collateral will be applied first to ratably repay the obligations in respect of the
Notes and any other Additional Pari Passu Obligations, and, second, to repay the obligations under the New Second
Lien Credit Facility. No assurance can be given that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral will
be sufficient to pay our obligations under the Notes, in full or at all, while also paying the other Additional Pari
Passu Obligations.

Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the Notes. Any
claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the Notes and any Additional Pari Passu
Obligations from the sale of the Collateral securing the Notes and the obligations under the Notes will rank equally
in right of payment with all of our other unsubordinated indebtedness, including trade payables.

**_Rights of holders of the Notes in the Collateral securing the Notes may be adversely affected by bankruptcy_**
**_proceedings._**

The right of the Applicable Collateral Agent to repossess and dispose or otherwise realize upon of the Collateral
securing the Notes upon acceleration is likely to be significantly impaired by federal bankruptcy law if bankruptcy
proceedings are commenced by or against us prior to or possibly even after the Applicable Collateral Agent has
repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the
Applicable Collateral Agent, is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from
disposing of security repossessed from a debtor, without bankruptcy court approval. Moreover, bankruptcy law
permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the
collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured
creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to
circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral and
may include cash payments or the granting of additional security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion
determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or
any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. In view of the broad
discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how long payments under the secured notes
could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy case, whether or when the Applicable Collateral Agent
would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, or whether or to what extent holders of the secured notes would be
compensated for any delay in payment of loss of value of the collateral through the requirements of “adequate
protection.” Furthermore, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not
sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes would have “undersecured claims” as to

57


-----

the difference and would not be entitled to post-petition interest or “adequate protection” with respect to such
difference. Federal bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs and attorneys’ fees for
“undersecured claims” during the debtor’s bankruptcy case.

**_The Collateral securing the Notes may be diluted under certain circumstances._**

The Collateral that will secure the Notes also secures our obligations under the New First Lien Credit Facilities
on a first-priority basis and the New Second Lien Credit Facility on a second-priority basis. This Collateral may
secure on a first-priority basis additional senior indebtedness that we or certain of our subsidiaries incur in the
future, subject to restrictions on our ability to incur debt and liens under the indenture that will govern the Notes and
the credit agreements that will govern the New Credit Facilities. Your rights to the Collateral would be diluted, and
in certain cases could be primed, by any increase in the indebtedness secured on a first-priority or parity basis by
such Collateral.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and
other imperfections as may be accepted by the creditors that have the benefit of first liens on the Collateral securing
the Notes from time to time, whether on or after the date the Notes are issued. The initial purchasers did not analyze
the effect of, nor participate in, any negotiations relating to, such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could
adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the secured notes as well as the ability of the Applicable
Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral.

In the event that a bankruptcy or other insolvency case is commenced by or against us, if the value of the
Collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and all other Additional
Pari Passu Obligations, interest may cease to accrue on the secured notes from and after the date the bankruptcy
petition is filed or other insolvency proceeding commenced.

In addition, our business requires numerous federal, state and local permits and licenses. Continued operation of
properties that are the Collateral securing the Notes depends on the maintenance of such permits and licenses. Our
business is subject to substantial regulations and permitting requirements and may be adversely affected if we are
unable to comply with existing regulations or requirements or changes in applicable regulations or requirements. In
the event of foreclosure or other enforcement of security, the transfer of such permits and licenses may be prohibited
or may require us to incur significant cost and expense. Further, we cannot assure you that the applicable
governmental authorities will consent to the transfer of all such permits. If the regulatory approvals required for such
transfers are not obtained or are delayed, the foreclosure or other enforcement of security may be delayed, a
temporary shutdown of operations may result and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased.

**_The rights of holders of the Notes to the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security_**
**_interests in such Collateral and other issues generally associated with the realization of security interests in_**
**_collateral._**

Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party including enforceability
vis-a-vis third parties upon registration before the relevant public registries. The liens on the Collateral securing the
Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if the Applicable Collateral Agent is not able to
take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens on or prior to the issue date of the Notes. In addition,
applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as
real property, can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified and additional
steps to perfect in such property and rights are taken. The Issuers and the Guarantors will have limited obligations to
perfect the security interest of the holders of the Notes in the Collateral. There can be no assurance that the trustee or
the Applicable Collateral Agent will monitor, or that we will inform such trustee or Applicable Collateral Agent of,
the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral securing the Notes, and that the necessary
action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired Collateral. The Applicable
Collateral Agent has no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that could constitute
Collateral securing the Notes or the perfection of any security interest. This may result in the loss of the security

58


-----

interest in the Collateral securing the Notes or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes against third
parties.

In addition, the security interest of the Applicable Collateral Agent will be subject to practical challenges
generally associated with the realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, the Applicable Collateral
Agent may need to obtain the consent of third parties and make additional filings. If we are unable to obtain these
consents or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the holders will not be entitled to the
affected Collateral or any recovery with respect thereto. We cannot assure you that the Applicable Collateral Agent
will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be
given when required to facilitate a foreclosure or other security enforcement on such assets. Accordingly, the
Applicable Collateral Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon or otherwise enforce against those assets and
the value of the affected Collateral may significantly decrease.

**_The Collateral securing the Notes is subject to casualty risks._**

Although we maintain insurance policies to insure against losses, there are certain losses that may be either
uninsurable or not economically insurable, in whole or in part. As a result, it is possible that the insurance proceeds
will not compensate us fully for our losses in the event of a catastrophic loss. If there is a total or partial loss of any
of the Collateral, we cannot assure you that any insurance proceeds received by us will be sufficient to satisfy all the
first lien secured obligations, including the Notes.

**_We will, in most cases, have control over the Collateral, and the sale of particular assets by us could reduce the_**
**_pool of assets securing the Notes and any future guarantees. In addition, certain assets, including Excluded_**
**_Assets, will be excluded from the Collateral._**

Subject to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor
Agreement, the security documents allow us to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate,
and collect, invest and dispose of any income from, the Collateral. For example, so long as no event of default under
the indenture governing the Notes would result therefrom, we may, among other things, without any release or
consent by the Trustee, conduct activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or
otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making cash payments (including repayments of indebtedness). The lien
on the Collateral will be automatically released upon any permitted disposition thereof to a person that is not an
Issuer or Guarantor of the Notes. See “Description of Notes.”

In addition, certain assets, including Excluded Assets, will be excluded from the Collateral. See “Description of
Notes—Security” for the definition of “Excluded Assets.”

**_Any future pledge of Collateral or guarantee provided after the Notes are issued might be avoided by us or by a_**
**_trustee in bankruptcy._**

The indenture governing the Notes and the collateral documents will require us to cause any domestic
subsidiary that guarantees the New First Lien Credit Facilities or the New Second Lien Credit Facility or Existing
Notes of the Issuers to provide a guarantee of the Notes and will require us to cause such Guarantor to grant liens on
certain assets that we or any such Guarantor holds at the time the Notes are issued or acquires after the Notes are
issued. Any future guarantee or additional lien in favor of the Applicable Collateral Agents for the benefit of the
holders of the Notes might be avoidable by the grantor (as debtor-in possession) or by a trustee in bankruptcy or
other third parties if certain events or circumstances exist or occur. For instance, if the entity granting a future
guarantee or additional lien was insolvent at the time of the grant and if such grant was made within 90 days before
that entity commenced a bankruptcy proceeding (or one year before commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding if
the creditor that benefited from the guarantee or lien is an “insider” under the Bankruptcy Code), and the granting of
the future guarantee or additional lien enabled the holders of the Notes to receive more than they would if the
grantor were liquidated under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, then such guarantee or lien could be avoided as a
preferential transfer. Liens recorded or perfected after the issue date may be treated under bankruptcy law as if they
were delivered to secure previously existing indebtedness. In bankruptcy proceedings commenced within 90 days of
lien perfection (or one year for insiders), a lien given to secure previously existing indebtedness is materially more
likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the issue
date (or within a 30-day safe harbor provided for in the Bankruptcy Code). Accordingly, if we or any Guarantor of

59


-----

the secured notes were to file for bankruptcy or other insolvency protection after the issue date with respect to the
Notes being offered hereby and the liens had been perfected less than 90 days (one year for insiders)before the
commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, the liens securing the Notes may be subject to challenge as a
preference as a result of having been delivered after the issue date of the Notes. To the extent that such challenge
succeeded, the holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the security that the Collateral was intended to provide
and could be required to return payments previously received.

**_Lien searches may not reveal all existing liens on the Collateral that will secure the Notes._**

We will conduct lien searches on the Collateral securing the Notes in the United States and cannot guarantee
that these lien searches will reveal all existing liens on such Collateral. Any existing undiscovered lien could be
significant, could be prior in ranking to the liens securing the Notes or the guarantees and could have an adverse
effect on the ability of the Applicable Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose upon the Collateral securing the Notes.
In addition, certain statutory priority liens may also exist that cannot or will not be discovered by lien searches.

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

**Acquisition**

On April 7, 2022, Parent, formed by affiliates of Brookfield, and its subsidiary Merger Sub entered into the
Merger Agreement with CDK, pursuant to which Parent agreed to acquire CDK as specified in the Merger
Agreement. The Acquisition is structured as an Equity Tender Offer by Merger Sub to purchase all of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock of CDK at a per share price equal to the Equity Tender Offer Price. Following
the consummation of the Equity Tender Offer and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of conditions as set forth in
the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into CDK, with CDK continuing as the surviving
corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and with all remaining shares of Common Stock (if
any) not owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates (excluding certain dissenting shares as set forth in
the Merger Agreement) canceled and converted into the right to receive the Equity Tender Offer Price.

Parent will need approximately $8,700.0 million to fund the consideration payable in respect of all of the shares
of the Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement and to refinance $1,790.0 million in aggregate principal
amount of existing debt of CDK.

Completion of the Acquisition is subject to various conditions, including, among others, (i) the Minimum
Condition, (ii) the absence of any order, or the enactment of any law, prohibiting the Acquisition, (iii) approvals
and/or termination or expiration of any applicable waiting periods (including any extensions thereof) under the HSR
Act and the Competition Act (Canada), (iv) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the parties and compliance by the parties with their respective obligations under the Merger
Agreement, (v) performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement
and (vi) the absence, since the date of the Merger Agreement, of any fact, event, development or effect that has had,
or would be reasonably expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger
Agreement). In addition, the parties agreed that the expiration of the Equity Tender Offer will not occur prior to July
1, 2022, as may be extended under certain circumstances. On April 25, 2022, the parties received an Advance
Ruling Certificate from the Canadian Competition Bureau confirming that there would not be sufficient grounds to
apply to the Competition Tribunal for an order under the Competition Act (Canada) to prohibit the completion of the
Transaction. At 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on May 6, 2022, the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act with
respect to the purchase of shares in the Equity Tender Offer expired.

The Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights for both Parent and CDK, including the right of
each party to terminate the Merger Agreement if, other than in certain circumstances described therein, the
Acquisition has not been consummated by October 7, 2022. The Merger Agreement provides that, if any party to the
Merger Agreement fails or refuses to perform any covenant or agreement, the non-breaching party may seek specific
performance of such covenant or agreement, subject to certain restrictions on the ability of CDK to seek specific
performance to enforce Parent’s obligation to provide equity financing. In addition, upon termination of the Merger
Agreement under specified circumstances, Parent may be required to pay CDK a termination fee.

**Acquisition Financing Transactions**

On April 20, 2022, CDK announced an offer to purchase for cash any and all of its outstanding Existing Notes.
The Debt Tender Offers expire at 5:00 P.M., New York City time, at the end of the day on July 5, 2022. In
connection with the Debt Tender Offers, CDK sought consents to the adoption of proposed amendments to each of
the Existing Indentures to, among other things, eliminate any obligation to make a change of control offer,
substantially all of the other restrictive covenants and certain events of default and other provisions. The
consummation of each Debt Tender Offer is conditioned upon the consummation of the Acquisition and certain
other customary conditions. As of the date of this offering memorandum, for each Debt Tender Offer, the Requisite
Consent has been received and the Supplemental Indenture has been executed. Accordingly, any Existing Notes that
remain outstanding will not benefit from any of the restrictive covenants that are eliminated by the adoption of the
Proposed Amendments and will be unsecured obligations of the Issuers, effectively junior in right of payment to all
of the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ existing and future secured senior indebtedness (including the Notes and the New
Credit Facilities) to the extent of the value of the Collateral.


-----

Holders of Existing Notes who validly tendered (and did not validly withdraw) their Existing Notes and validly
delivered (and did not validly revoke) their corresponding consents at or prior to (x) 5:00 P.M., New York City time,
on May 3, 2022 in the case of the 2027 Notes and the 2029 Notes and (y) 5:00 P.M., New York City time, on May 6,
2022 in the case of the 2024 Notes (in each case of (x) and (y), such time and date with respect to a Debt Tender
Offer, the “Consent Time”), and whose Existing Notes are accepted for purchase, will receive consideration equal to
(i) $1,036.25 per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes tendered, (ii) $1,012.50 per $1,000 principal amount of
the 2027 Notes tendered and (iii) $1,012.50 per $1,000 principal amount of the 2029 Notes tendered, in each case,
plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes up to, but not including, the Debt Tender Offers
Settlement Date, which is expected to promptly follow the Expiration Date and coincide with the closing of the
Acquisition. Holders of Existing Notes who validly tender their Existing Notes after the applicable Consent Time
but on or prior to the Expiration Date, and whose Existing Notes are accepted for purchase, will receive
consideration equal to (i) $1,006.25 per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes tendered, (ii) $982.50 per $1,000
principal amount of the 2027 Notes tendered and (iii) $982.50 per $1,000 principal amount of the 2029 Notes
tendered, in each case, plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes up to, but not including, the Debt
Tender Offers Settlement Date.

We expect to decrease the principal amount of the New Second Lien Credit Facility by the aggregate principal
amount of Existing Notes (if any) that remain outstanding after the Expiration Date. As of the date of this offering
memorandum, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of each series of Existing Notes that were not tendered
and would remain outstanding is approximately (i) $87 million of the 2024 Notes, (ii) $62 million of the 2027 Notes
and (iii) $10 million of the 2029 Notes.

To finance the Acquisition, the Debt Tender Offers and the other transactions related to the Acquisition, we
intend to issue the Notes offered hereby and, concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition, enter into (i) the New
First Lien Credit Facilities, initially consisting of (x) a 7-year $3,600.0 million New First Lien Term Loan Facility
and (y) a 5-year $650.0 million New Revolving Facility, with no amounts expected to be drawn from the New
Revolving Facility at the closing of the Acquisition and (ii) an 8-year $865.0 million New Second Lien Credit
Facility (which includes an $87.0 million delayed draw portion for the refinancing of 2024 Notes that remain
outstanding after the Expiration Date of the Debt Tender Offers), subject to reduction as noted above. We intend to
use the proceeds of this offering and the borrowings under the New Credit Facilities, together with equity
contributions from funds affiliated with Brookfield, (1) to pay the cash consideration for the Acquisition, (2) to
repay all amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Facility, (3) to pay the cash consideration for the Debt
Tender Offers, (4) to pay fees and expenses related to the foregoing and (5) for general corporate purposes. See “Use
of Proceeds,” “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information” and “The Transactions.” The foregoing
financing transactions described in this paragraph are collectively referred to in this offering memorandum as the
“Acquisition Financing Transactions.” The Acquisition, the Debt Tender Offers and the Acquisition Financing
Transactions and the payment of related fees and expenses are collectively referred to in this offering memorandum
as the “Transactions.”

The closing of this offering is not conditioned on consummation of the other Acquisition Financing
Transactions, but release of the proceeds of this offering from the escrow account (as described below) will require,
among other things, that the borrowings under the New Credit Facilities be drawn in connection with the
Acquisition and be available to the Issuers on the date of such release and completion of the Acquisition on such
date. We cannot assure you that such Acquisition Financing Transactions will be completed or, if completed, on
what terms they will be completed. In particular, the terms of our New Credit Facilities are subject to change, as we
expect to enter into the New Credit Facilities subsequent to the consummation of this offering.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The following table summarizes the estimated sources and uses of proceeds in connection with the
Transactions, assuming the Transactions occurred on March 31, 2022, and after the net proceeds of the Notes are
released from escrow. Actual amounts may vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including,
among other things, the date of the closing of the Transactions, differences from our estimate of fees, expenses and
other costs related to the Transactions, differences from our estimate of our cash and cash equivalents expected
immediately prior to the closing of the Acquisition, our working capital and any changes made to the sources of the
contemplated debt financing and the issue price thereof. The proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be used solely
by the Issuers, either directly or indirectly, for the uses identified below. You should read the following together
with the information included under “The Transactions,” “Capitalization” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated
Financial Information” included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

portion for the refinancing of 2024 Notes that remain outstanding after the Expiration Date of the Debt Tender
Offers), subject to reduction by the aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes (if any) that remain
outstanding after the Expiration Date of the Debt Tender Offers. The table above assumes that $158.0 million of

**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The following unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022 and the unaudited pro
forma consolidated statements of income for the year ended June 30, 2021, nine months ended March 31, 2022, nine
months ended March 31, 2021 and twelve months ended March 31, 2022 are based on the historical consolidated
financial statements of CDK Global, Inc. included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The unaudited pro
forma combined statement of income for the twelve months ended March 31, 2022 has been derived by taking the
unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of income data for the year ended June 30, 2021, adding the unaudited
pro forma consolidated statement of income data for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 and subtracting the
unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of income for the nine months ended March 31, 2021.

The unaudited pro forma combined consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022 gives pro forma effect to
the Transactions described below as if these events occurred on March 31, 2022. The unaudited pro forma combined
statements of income for the year ended June 30, 2021, nine months ended March 31, 2022, nine months ended
March 31, 2021 and last twelve months ended March 31, 2022 give pro forma effect to the Transactions described
below as if these events occurred at the beginning of the applicable period.

On April 7, 2022, Parent, formed by affiliates of Brookfield, and its subsidiary Merger Sub entered into the
Merger Agreement with CDK, pursuant to which Parent agreed to acquire CDK as specified in the Merger
Agreement. The Acquisition is structured as an Equity Tender Offer by Merger Sub to purchase all of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock of CDK at a per share price of $54.87 in cash, without interest. Following the
consummation of the Equity Tender Offer and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of conditions as set forth in the
Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into CDK, with CDK continuing as the surviving
corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and with all remaining shares of Common Stock (if
any) not owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates (excluding certain dissenting shares as set forth in
the Merger Agreement) extinguished for a per share price of $54.87 in cash, without interest. Completion of the
Acquisition is subject to various conditions.

On April 20, 2022, CDK announced an offer to purchase for cash any and all of its outstanding Existing Notes.
The Debt Tender Offers expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, at the end of the day on July 5, 2022. In
connection with the Debt Tender Offers, CDK sought consents to the adoption of proposed amendments to each of
the Existing Indentures to, among other things, eliminate any obligation to make a change of control offer,
substantially all of the other restrictive covenants and certain events of default and other provisions. The
consummation of each Debt Tender Offer is conditioned upon the consummation of the Acquisition and certain
other customary conditions. As of the date of this offering memorandum, for each Debt Tender Offer, the Requisite
Consent has been received and the Supplemental Indenture has been executed.

Holders of Existing Notes who validly tendered (and did not validly withdraw) their Existing Notes and validly
delivered (and did not validly revoke) their corresponding consents at or prior to the applicable Consent Time, and
whose Existing Notes are accepted for purchase, will receive consideration equal to (i) $1,036.25 per $1,000
principal amount of the 2024 Notes tendered, (ii) $1,012.50 per $1,000 principal amount of the 2027 Notes tendered
and (iii) $1,012.50 per $1,000 principal amount of the 2029 Notes tendered, in each case, plus any accrued and
unpaid interest on the Existing Notes up to, but not including, the Debt Tender Offers Settlement Date, which is
expected to promptly follow the Expiration Date and coincide with the closing of the Acquisition. Holders of
Existing Notes who validly tender their Existing Notes after the applicable Consent Time but on or prior to the
Expiration Date, and whose Existing Notes are accepted for purchase, will receive consideration equal to
(i) $1,006.25 per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes tendered, (ii) $982.50 per $1,000 principal amount of
the 2027 Notes tendered and (iii) $982.50 per $1,000 principal amount of the 2029 Notes tendered, in each case,
plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes up to, but not including, the Debt Tender Offers
Settlement Date.

We expect to decrease the principal amount of the New Second Lien Credit Facility by the aggregate principal
amount of Existing Notes (if any) that remain outstanding after the Expiration Date. As of the date of this offering
memorandum, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of each series of Existing Notes that were not tendered
and would remain outstanding is approximately (i) $87 million of the 2024 Notes, (ii) $62 million of the 2027 Notes
and (iii) $10 million of the 2029 Notes.


-----

Parent will need approximately $8,700.0 million to fund the consideration payable in respect of all of the shares
of the Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement and to refinance $1,790.0 million in aggregate principal
amount of existing debt of CDK (to the extent it is not rolled over).

**Acquisition Financing Transactions**

To finance the Acquisition, the Debt Tender Offers and the other transactions related to the Acquisition, we
intend to issue the Notes offered hereby and, concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition, enter into (i) the New
First Lien Credit Facilities, initially consisting of (x) a 7-year $3,600.0 million New First Lien Term Loan Facility
and (y) a 5-year $650.0 million New Revolving Facility, with no amounts expected to be drawn from the New
Revolving Facility at the closing of the Acquisition and (ii) an 8-year $865.0 million New Second Lien Credit
Facility (which includes an additional $87.0 million delayed draw portion for the refinancing of 2024 Notes that
remain outstanding after the Expiration Date of the Debt Tender Offers), subject to reduction as noted above. We
intend to use the proceeds of this offering and the borrowings under the New Credit Facilities, together with equity
contributions from funds affiliated with Brookfield, (1) to pay the cash consideration for the Acquisition, (2) to
repay all amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Facility, (3) to pay the cash consideration for the Debt
Tender Offers, (4) to pay fees and expenses related to the foregoing and (5) for general corporate purposes. See “Use
of Proceeds” and “The Transactions.” The foregoing financing transactions described in this paragraph are
collectively referred to herein as the “Acquisition Financing Transactions.” The Acquisition, the Debt Tender Offers
and the Acquisition Financing Transactions and the payment of related fees and expenses are collectively referred to
herein as the “Transactions.”

The pro forma adjustments set forth in the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information reflect the
following:

  - the Acquisition and changes in assets and liabilities to record the preliminary estimates of their respective
fair values in accordance with purchase accounting;

  - changes in amortization and depreciation expense resulting from the preliminary fair value adjustments to
the amortizable assets of CDK in the Acquisition;

  - changes in indebtedness incurred in connection with the Transactions;

  - certain transaction fees and debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the Transactions;

  - changes in interest expense resulting from the Transactions, including amortization of estimated debt
issuance costs;

  - a preliminary estimate of the effect of the above adjustments on deferred income tax assets, liabilities and
related expense; and

  - the equity impact of the Transactions and the corresponding elimination of historical equity balances of
CDK.

Assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes, which should be
read in conjunction with the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information. The unaudited pro forma
adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that CDK management believes are
reasonable under the circumstances. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is presented for
informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what the results of operations or financial condition
would have been had the Transactions actually occurred on the dates indicated, nor do they purport to project the
results of operations or financial condition for any future period or as of any future date. The unaudited pro forma
consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled “Risk Factors,”
“Summary—The Transactions,” “Summary—Sources and Uses of Funds,” “Use of Proceeds,” “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” as well as the historical financial
statements and related notes of CDK Global, Inc. appearing elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Revisions to
the preliminary estimates set forth herein may have a significant impact on the pro forma amounts of total assets,
total liabilities and equity, revenues, amortization expense, interest expense and income tax expense. The actual

68


-----

adjustments will be made as of the closing date of the Acquisition, and certain of such adjustments will remain
subject to further adjustment based on new information for a period of up to 12 months after the closing date.

The statements contained herein do not reflect the costs of any integration activities or benefits that may result
from the realization of future margin improvements from operating efficiencies, or any other synergies that may
result from the Transactions.

(1) Concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition, the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, Holdings, the Guarantors and certain

other subsidiaries of the Issuer will enter into the New Revolving Facility. The New Revolving Facility is
expected to have a total borrowing capacity of $650.0 million. The table above assumes that the New Revolving
Facility will be undrawn at the close of the Acquisition. We may draw from the New Revolving Facility to
provide for working capital needs and for purchase price and/or working capital adjustments, if any, in
connection with the Acquisition. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.”

(2) Concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition, the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, Holdings, the Guarantors and certain

other subsidiaries of the Issuer will enter into the New First Lien Term Loan Facility. The New First Lien Term
Loan Facility is expected to consist of $3,600.0 million in US Dollar denominated initial term loans. See
“Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.”

(3) Concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition, the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, Holdings, the Guarantors and certain

other subsidiaries of the Issuer will enter into the New Second Lien Facility. The New Second Lien Facility is
expected to have a total borrowing capacity of $865.0 million (which includes an $87.0 million delayed draw
portion for the refinancing of 2024 Notes that remain outstanding after the Expiration Date of the Debt Tender
Offers), subject to reduction by the aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes (if any) that remain
outstanding after the Expiration Date of the Debt Tender Offers. The table above assumes that $158.0 million of
Existing Notes remains outstanding, which is the aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes that would
remain outstanding assuming all Existing Notes tendered at or prior to the date of this offering memorandum
are purchased pursuant to a Tender Offer. See “The Transactions” and “Description of Certain Other
Indebtedness.”

(4) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby. We intend to use the proceeds from this

offering and the borrowings under the New Credit Facilities, together with equity contributions from funds

outstanding under the Existing Credit Facility, (3) to pay the cash consideration for the Debt Tender Offers, (4)
to pay fees and expenses related to the foregoing and (5) for general corporate purposes. If the Escrow Release
Conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Release Date, the Notes will be subject to a special
mandatory redemption. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special Mandatory
Redemption.”

(5) Assumes that $158.0 million of Existing Notes remains outstanding following the Expiration Date of the Debt

Tender Offers, which is the aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes that would remain outstanding
assuming all Existing Notes tendered at or prior to the date of this offering memorandum are purchased
pursuant to a Tender Offer. See “The Transactions” and “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.”

(7) Reflects the estimated total cash consideration to be paid in connection with the Acquisition to equity holders of

CDK at or immediately following the consummation of the Acquisition, including the estimated total cash
consideration of approximately $6,369.9 million to be paid for the acquisition of CDK. Total consideration
above reflects the cash balance as of March 31, 2021 in accordance with the pro forma balance sheet.
Acquisition consideration in the Sources & Uses reflects the cash balance expected at close. See “The
Transactions.”

(8) Reflects our estimate of fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including financial advisory fees,

legal, accounting and other professional fees and transaction costs incurred in connection with the Transactions.
All fees, expenses and other costs are estimates and actual amounts may significantly differ from those set forth
in this offering memorandum.

**b. Goodwill**

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information includes various assumptions, including those related
to the preliminary purchase price allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on management’s
best estimates of fair value. The final purchase price allocation may vary based on final appraisals, valuations and
analyses of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma
adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for illustrative purposes. The following represents the effect
of purchase accounting based on a preliminary valuation. The following shows the preliminary allocation of the
purchase price for CDK to the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities assumed and pro forma goodwill:

**Total consideration transferred ..........................................................................................** **$** **8,145**

**Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation:**
Accounts receivable, net ......................................................................................................... 242
Property, plant and equipment, net ......................................................................................... 62
Intangible assets, net .............................................................................................................. 4,430
Other assets ............................................................................................................................ 626
**Total Assets Acquired ..........................................................................................................** **$** **5,360**

Current maturities of long-term debt and finance lease liabilities .......................................... (10)
Accounts payable ................................................................................................................... (26)
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities ....................................................................... (207)
Litigation liability ................................................................................................................... (34)
Accrued payroll and payroll-related expenses ........................................................................ (80)
Deferred revenue .................................................................................................................... (65)
Debt and finance lease liabilities ............................................................................................ (160)

Other liabilities ....................................................................................................................... (99)
**Net Assets Acquired .............................................................................................................** **$** **3,513**
Non-controlling interests ........................................................................................................ (14)
**Goodwill ................................................................................................................................** **$** **4,646**

The excess purchase price over the reported book value of the net assets for the Acquisition is recorded to
Goodwill and will be allocated through purchase accounting based on the fair value of the assets and liabilities at the
closing of the transaction.

**c.** **Debt**

Reflects a net increase in total debt of $3,187.0 million, consisting of:

i. an increase of $3,600.0 million of borrowings under the New First Lien Term Loan Facility;

ii. an increase of $707.0 million of borrowings under the New Second Lien Credit Facility;

iii. an increase of $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of debt relating to the Notes;

76


-----

iv. a decrease of $260.0 million relating to the incurrence of debt issuance costs for the Notes offered hereby
and the New First Lien Term Loan Facility and New Second Lien Credit Facility, which are presented as
a direct deduction from debt on the balance sheet and recognized as non-cash interest expense over the
estimated life of the related debt obligations; and

v. a decrease of $1,617.0 million for the extinguishment of debt, which represents the total net book value
of debt of $1,775 million less $158 million of Existing Notes that will remain outstanding as of March
31, 2022.

vi. Accrued expenses and other current liabilities are decreased by $20.0 million related to the payment of
accrued interest on extinguished debt.

**d. Deferred income taxes**

Reflects an increase of $1,049.0 million to deferred income tax liabilities related to fair value adjustments. The
Unaudited Pro Forma Statements of Income have been adjusted to reflect the deferred tax impact of the pro forma
adjustments based on an effective tax rate of 26%.

**e.** **Total Equity**

Adjustments to equity reflect a net increase in the amount of $2,972.0 million, consisting of:

i. an increase in equity to reflect the estimated equity contributions from funds affiliated with Brookfield in
the amount of $2,730.0 million;

ii. a decrease in equity to reflect the elimination of historical equity of $2,146.0 million, which reflects the
pro forma adjustments described herein;

iii. an increase in equity to reflect the elimination of historical treasury stock of $2,518.0 million;

iv. an decrease in equity to reflect the elimination of historical accumulated other comprehensive loss of
$72.0 million; and

v. a decrease in retained earnings of $58.0 million relating to the portion of estimated acquisition-related,
and a portion of the financing-related, transaction costs and fees, that will be expensed immediately as
incurred.

**f.** **Intangibles and Property, plant and equipment**

As part of the Acquisition, the fair value adjustment applied to property, plant and equipment is expected to
reduce the carrying value of real property by $11.0 million. The fair value adjustment applied to intangible assets is
expected to result in an increase to carrying value of $4,046.0 million, where total intangible assets, after the fair
value adjustment is applied, comprises customer relationship intangibles with an average useful life of 15 years,
brand intangibles with an average useful life of 14 years, and developed technology assets with an average useful
life of 5 years. Depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 would
have increased by $239.0 million and $261.0 million, respectively. Depreciation and amortization for the last twelve
months ended March 31, 2022 and year ended June 30, 2021 would have increased by $321.0 million and $346.0
million, respectively.

**g. Acquisition costs**

Represents the accrual of $58.0 million of estimated transaction costs incurred subsequent to March 31, 2022.
These costs will not affect the statements of operating results beyond 12 months after the acquisition date.

**h. Interest expense**

Adjustments to interest expense consist of: an increase to interest expense, based on an assumed weighted
average interest rate of approximately 6.7%, consisting of (i) borrowings under the New First Lien Term Loan

77


-----

Facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3,600.0 million, (ii) borrowings under the New Second Lien Credit
Facility in the aggregate principal amount of $707.0 million, (iii) the issuance of the Notes in the aggregate principal
amount of $750.0 million and (iv) the non-cash amortization of the discount and debt issuance costs on the Notes,
New First Lien Term Loan Facility and New Second Lien Credit Facility of $260.0 million in the aggregate.

Interest expense may increase or decrease based upon changes in future rates. The adjustment to expense the
write off of the unamortized debt issuance costs related to the debt expected to be repaid in the Acquisition and
recorded as a direct deduction to the debt on the balance sheet has not been reflected in the accompanying pro forma
consolidated statements of income for the periods presented. Those costs are one-time in nature and are not expected
to have any continuing impact. For each increase or decrease in assumed interest rates of 25 basis points, annual
interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately $13 million.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**

**OPERATIONS**

_You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations_
_together with the sections entitled “Basis of Presentation and Other Information,” “Risk Factors,” “Unaudited Pro_
_Forma Consolidated Financial Information” and “Summary Historical Financial Data” and with the consolidated_
_financial statements of CDK and the related notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The following_
_discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements_
_and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those set forth under “Risk Factors”_
_and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Actual results may differ materially from those_
_contained in any forward-looking statement. The terms “CDK,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to CDK_
_Global, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries after giving effect to the Acquisition described elsewhere in this_
_offering memorandum._

**Overview**

CDK Global Inc. is a leading provider of mission critical technology and SaaS data solutions for dealerships in
the automotive retail and adjacent heavy truck, recreation, and heavy equipment industries in North America. Our
solutions automate and integrate all aspects of operating a dealership and the vehicle buying and servicing process,
including the acquisition, sale, financing, insuring, parts supply, and repair and maintenance of vehicles. Enabling
end-to-end, omnichannel retail commerce through open, agnostic technology, we provide our solutions to both
dealers and OEMs and served over 15,000 dealer sites and adjacent businesses served across North America as of
March 31, 2022.

We generate revenue primarily by providing a broad suite of subscription-based software and technology
solutions to automotive retailers in North America, as well as to retailers and manufacturers of heavy trucks,
construction equipment, agricultural equipment, motorcycles, boats, and other marine and recreational vehicles. We
are focused on the use of SaaS and mobile-centric solutions that are highly functional, flexible, and fast. Our
flagship DMS software solutions are hosted ERP applications tailored to the unique requirements of the retail
automotive industry. Our DMS solutions facilitate most activities that generate revenue within a dealership
including: the sale of new and used vehicles, consumer financing, repair and maintenance services, and vehicle and
parts inventory management. These solutions also enable our customers to have company-wide accounting, financial
reporting, cash flow management, and payroll services. We also provide a broad portfolio of layered software
applications and services, a robust and secure interface to the DMS through our Partner Program, data management
and business intelligence solutions, a variety of professional services, and a full range of customer support solutions.
These additional products are integrated with the DMS and provide a full software solution suite to our customers.
Our DMSs are typically integrated with OEM data processing systems that enable automotive retailers to order
vehicles and parts, receive vehicle records, process warranties, and check recall campaigns and service bulletins
while helping them to fulfill their franchisee responsibilities to their OEM franchisers.

We believe we are the market leader in North America and have the largest installed base of DMS in the
industry. CDK has consistently grown market share and served over 5,600 customers representing over 15,000
dealer sites and adjacent businesses as of March 31, 2022, compared to 14,681 as of Fiscal Year 2019. Within the
core automotive space, CDK is primarily focused on the largest and most sophisticated dealerships, with 78% of
dealership customers having three or more dealer sites in fiscal year 2021, which positions the Company to benefit
from the consolidation trends in the industry. We are deeply embedded in our customers’ operations – the majority
of our customers use three to five CDK products on average, and our average customer tenure is approximately 20
years. The average customer contract length is approximately four years. In the LTM ended March 31, 2022,
approximately 78% of our revenue was generated from multi-year subscription contracts where revenue is tied to
customer site count, not transaction volume.

The strength of our business model is reflected in our financial performance. In the LTM period ended March
31, 2022, we generated approximately $1,763 million of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue, which represents a 3%
CAGR since fiscal 2019, and $811 million of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, which represents a margin of
approximately 46% including $146 million of margin improvement initiatives identified by Brookfield.

**COVID-19 Response**

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID19 outbreak and associated counteracting measures implemented by governments around the world, as well as
increased business uncertainty, caused a significant shift in automotive retail activity, and the operations of our
dealer customers in particular. To support our customers, we offered financial and other assistance during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2020 and added product benefits to facilitate remote delivery and touchless transactions. We also
took steps to monitor our cash flow and liquidity and to migrate many employees to their current work-from-home
status.

As conditions continue to fluctuate around the world, governments and organizations have responded by
adjusting their restrictions and guidelines accordingly. Activity in the automotive market improved during fiscal
2021, and we expect that improvement trend to continue during fiscal 2022, though substantial uncertainty remains,
including supply chain disruption and resulting inflationary pressures. Our focus remains on promoting employee
health and safety, serving our dealer customers and ensuring business continuity. Overall, we believe we are well
positioned for further growth opportunities as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic recedes in the markets we
serve and we remain committed to our management philosophy, company goals and our business strategy. However,
while our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the
duration of the pandemic and the broader implications of the macro-economic recovery on our business remain
uncertain.

**Acquisition**

After completing the Transactions, we will be significantly leveraged. To finance the Acquisition, we intend to
issue the Notes offered hereby and, concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition, enter into (i) the New First Lien
Credit Facilities, initially consisting of (x) a 7-year $3,600.0 million New First Lien Term Loan Facility and (y) a 5year $650.0 million New Revolving Facility, with no amounts expected to be drawn from the New Revolving
Facility at the closing of the Acquisition and (ii) an 8-year $865.0 million New Second Lien Credit Facility (which
includes an $87.0 million delayed draw portion for the refinancing of 2024 Notes that remain outstanding after the
Expiration Date of the Debt Tender Offers) subject to reduction by the aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes
(if any) that remains outstanding after the Expiration Date of the Debt Tender Offers. We intend to use the proceeds
from this offering and the borrowings under the New Credit Facilities, together with equity contributions from funds


-----

affiliated with Brookfield, (i) to pay the cash consideration for the Acquisition, (ii) to repay all amounts outstanding
under the Existing Credit Facility, (3) to pay the cash consideration for the Debt Tender Offers, (4) to pay fees and
expenses related to the foregoing and (5) for general corporate purposes. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Description of
Certain Other Indebtedness.”

On a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Transactions, our estimated net financing charges for the twelve
months ended March 31, 2022 would have been approximately $387.2 million, which has been calculated using a
weighted average estimated blended rate of 6.7%. Borrowings under the New First Lien Term Loan Facility and
New Second Lien Credit Facility bear interest at variable rates and are subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates
increase, the debt service obligations on the loans would increase and cash required for servicing indebtedness
would increase. Refer to Note (h), “Interest expense,” of the notes to the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial
information.

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, to fund planned capital expenditures and otherwise
satisfy our obligations will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash in the future. This, to some extent, is
subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. We believe that,
based on current levels of operations, we will be able to meet our debt service and other obligations when due.
Significant assumptions underlie this belief, including that we will continue to be successful in implementing our
business strategy and that there will be no material adverse developments in our business, liquidity or capital
requirements. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our
obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities
and capital expenditures, sell assets, obtain additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a
portion of our debt on or before maturity. We cannot assure our investors that we would be able to accomplish any
of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our existing and
future indebtedness may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.

In addition, the Acquisition will be accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, whereby the
purchase price will be allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on their respective fair values, with the remainder being allocated to goodwill. The increase in the tax bases of
these assets will result in increased non-cash charges in future periods, principally related to the step-up in the value
of inventory, property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets. The effect of any step-up in the value of
inventory will be to increase the cost of sales and thereby reduce gross profit and gross margins for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2022. In addition to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense will
increase as a result of the Acquisition and we will incur sizable non-recurring expenses. See “Unaudited Pro Forma
Consolidated Financial Information.”

**Material Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations**

A number of material trends and/or uncertainties in our marketplace could have either a positive or negative
impact on our ability to conduct business, our results of operations, and/or our financial condition. The following is
a summary of trends or uncertainties that have the potential to affect our liquidity, capital resources, or results of
operations:

**_Automotive Market Trends_**

Changing market trends, including changes in the automotive marketplace could have a material impact on our
business. From time to time, factors such as the availability of automobile inventory and the economic trends of a
region could have an impact on the volume of automobiles sold at retail in one or more of the geographic markets in
which we operate. We also expect to see the continued consolidation of dealers into larger dealer groups that could
further enhance our position as a strategic partner with larger dealer groups. To some extent, our business is
impacted by these trends, either directly through a shift in the number of transactions processed by customers of our
transactional business, or indirectly through changes in our customers’ spending habits based on their own changes
in profitability.


-----

**_Acquisitions_**

Our ability to bring new solutions to market, research and develop, or acquire the data and technology that
enables those solutions is important to our continued success. In addition, our strategy includes the selective pursuit
of acquisitions that support or complement our existing technology and solution set, including through our
acquisition of Square Root, Inc. (“Square Root”), an Austin-based developer of data curation software for OEMs, in
February 2021 and our acquisition of Roadster, a Palo Alto, California-based digital sales platform that modernizes
the way consumers buy vehicles and the process in which dealers sell them, in June 2021. For example, dealers and
OEMs are accelerating their adoption of a modern retailing experience for consumers that will allow the option of
completing transactions online or in store. Our acquisition of Roadster paired with ELEAD’s automotive CRM
software and call center solutions will enhance an end-to-end digital retail experience. An inability to invest in the
continued development of new solutions for the automotive marketplace, or an inability to acquire, or successfully
integrate acquired, new technology or solutions due to a lack of liquidity or resources, could impair our strategic
position.

**_Data Security and Intellectual Property_**

Our success depends on our ability to maintain the security of our data and intellectual property, as well as our
customers’ data. Although we maintain a clear focus on data and system security, and we incur significant costs
securing our infrastructure annually in support of that focus, we may experience interruptions of service or potential
security issues that may be beyond our control.

**How We Assess our Performance**

We use various GAAP and non-GAAP financial metrics to analyze and evaluate the performance of our
business and to provide a greater understanding with respect to our results of operations. These include Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Margin and
Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue. Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free
Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Margin and Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue have important limitations as analytical tools
and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial performance as reported
under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived
in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating
activities as measures of our liquidity.

Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin,
Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Margin and Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue should not be considered as measures of
discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by
relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free
Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Margin and Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue only for supplemental purposes. For a
reconciliation of these metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see “Summary—Summary
Historical and Pro Forma Consolidated Financial and Operating Data.”

**_Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA_**

To provide investors with additional information in connection with our results as determined by GAAP, we
disclose Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP measures which management
believes provide useful information to investors. Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are not
calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as substitutes for net income or any other
operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures reported by other companies. We use Adjusted EBITDA to measure the operational strength and
performance of our business. We use Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to measure liquidity.

EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, net and
depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for, among other things, (1)
stock-based compensation expense; (2) transaction and integration-related costs; (3) legal and other expenses related
to regulatory and competition matters; (4) business process modernization program; (5) workplace optimization
expenses; (6) officer transition expense and (7) loss on extinguishment of debt. In addition to the preceding


-----

adjustments, Adjusted EBITDA excludes earnings (loss) from equity method investments and adds (without
duplication) the pro rata share of EBITDA of our equity investments, which represents our share of earnings
(whether or not distributed) before income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and interest
(income) expense, net of joint ventures and minority investees. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted
EBITDA further adjusted to exclude certain items which we believe are not reflective of ongoing performance.

We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to
provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items that we do not expect to continue
at the same level in the future, as well as other items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating
performance. Further, we believe Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA provide a meaningful
measure of operating profitability because we use them for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting
decisions, calculating incentive compensation for our employees, evaluating the performance and effectiveness of
our operating strategies and in evaluating potential acquisitions.

Pro Forma Adjusted is also calculated in a manner consistent with the terms of the instruments that will govern
our indebtedness.

**_Free Cash Flow_**

Free Cash Flow is defined as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures and capitalized software.
We use Free Cash Flow to evaluate our ability to generate cash that can be used for working capital requirements,
interest expense, repayment of indebtedness, financing new acquisitions and for continued re-investment in our
business.

**_Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue_**

Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue is defined as revenue adjusted to include the revenue from Roadster, Square Root
and Salty as if these acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the applicable period. We use Pro Forma Adjusted
Revenue as an estimate of the potential of our ongoing operations to generate revenue after giving effect to recent
acquisitions. See “Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Consolidated Financial and Operating Data.”

**Components of Results of Operations**

**_Revenue_**

We generally receive fee-based revenue by providing services to customers. We generate revenue from four
categories: subscription, on-site licenses and installation, transaction, and other.

_Subscription_

Our subscription category include revenue received for software and technology solutions provided to
automotive retailers and OEMs, which includes:

  - DMSs and layered applications, which may be installed on-site at the customer’s location, or hosted and
provided on a SaaS basis, including ongoing maintenance and support;

  - Interrelated services such as installation, initial training, and data updates; and

  - Prior to adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842 “Leases” (“ASC 842”), subscription
revenue included technology solutions in which hardware was provided on a service basis. This revenue
was previously classified as subscription revenue because under lease accounting guidance in effect prior to
ASC 842, substitution rights were considered substantive.

_On-site licenses and installation_

Our on-site licenses and installation category includes revenue received from DMS applications where the
software is installed on-site at the customer’s location and interrelated services such as installation.


-----

_Transaction_

Our transaction category includes revenue received from fees per transaction to process credit reports, vehicle
registrations, and automotive equity mining.

_Other_

Our other category includes revenue received for consulting and professional services, sales of hardware, and
other miscellaneous revenue. After the adoption of ASC 842 in fiscal 2020, Other revenue also includes leasing
revenue from hardware provided to customers on a service basis, as hardware substitution rights are not considered
substantive.

**_Expenses_**

Expenses generally relate to the cost of providing services to customers. Significant expenses include employee
payroll and other labor-related costs, the cost of hosting customer systems, third-party costs for transaction-based
solutions and licensed software utilized in our solution offerings, telecommunications, transportation and
distribution costs, computer hardware, software, and other general overhead items.

Total Revenue .................................................................... $ 1,336.4 $ 1,253.1 $ 83.3 7%

Revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 increased by $83.3 million compared to the nine months
ended March 31, 2021.

Subscription revenues increased due to the growth in DMS and applications and $34.6 million from acquisitions
in fiscal 2022, partially offset by the impact of ASC 842 which reallocates hardware-related lessor revenue from
subscription revenue to other revenue and a decline in Partner Program revenue.

Transaction revenues saw a slight decline due to ongoing dealer inventory shortages.

Other revenues increased reflecting higher hardware sales and revenue timing under ASC 842.

**_Cost of Revenue_**

Cost of revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 increased by $44.1 million compared to the nine
months ended March 31, 2021. Cost of revenue increased due to slightly higher leased hardware costs, network and
infrastructure fees, employee-related costs and travel expenses to support growth, partially offset by a decrease in
the cost to support the transition of our sold businesses. Cost of revenue includes expenses to research, develop, and
deploy new and enhanced solutions for our customers of $59.7 million and $55.7 million for the nine months ended
March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing 4.5% and 4.4% of revenue, respectively.

**_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_**

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 increased by $31.5
million compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2021. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased
primarily due to higher transaction and integration related costs associated with acquisitions and strategical business
opportunities, travel and marketing expenses, and employee-related costs including stock-based compensation.
These increases were partially offset by decreases in costs to support the transition of our sold businesses and lower
costs associated with our business process modernization program compared to fiscal 2021.

**_Litigation Provision_**

Litigation provision for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 decreased by $12.0 million as compared to nine
months ended March 31, 2021 as a result of minimal current year adjustments from the quarterly reassessment of
our litigation liability where we evaluate legal proceedings that could affect the amount of liability, including
amounts in excess of any prior accruals and make adjustments to those accruals as appropriate. Additional
information on the litigation provision is contained in Item 1 of Part I, “Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements”, Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies.

**_Interest Expense_**

Interest expense for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 decreased by $35.2 million as compared to the nine
months ended March 31, 2021 largely due to lower average debt level in the first nine months of fiscal 2022, which
was primarily attributable to the repayment of the three-year and five-year term loan facilities and the 5.875%
unsecured senior notes with a $500 million aggregate principal amount due in 2026 in the third and fourth quarter of
fiscal 2021, respectively.

**_Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt_**

In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt as a result of the forgiveness
of a Paycheck Protection Program loan. The loan was assumed as part of the acquisition of Roadster Inc. Also, in the


-----

third quarter of fiscal 2021, we repaid the indebtedness under the three-year term loan facility and five-year term
loan facility. As a result, we recorded expenses of $2.2 million for the write-off of unamortized debt financing costs.

**_Loss from Equity Method Investment_**

Loss from equity method investment for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 decreased by $19.2 million as
compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2021 driven by $14.5 million of impairment charges for an equity
method investment along with the recognition of equity losses in the third quarter of fiscal 2021.

**_Other Income, Net_**

Other income, net for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 decreased by $23.9 million as compared to the
nine months ended March 31, 2021 due largely to the decline in income associated with on-going transition support
of our sold businesses.

**_Provision for Income Taxes_**

Income tax expense was $75.1 million and $73.8 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. The effective tax rate expressed by calculating the provision for income taxes as a percentage of
earnings before income taxes was 26.6% and 32.4%, for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 differed from the U.S. federal
statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to state and local income taxes and non-deductible officers’ compensation,
partially offset by a $2.0 million benefit due to the expiration of the statute of limitations related to certain transfer
pricing exposures. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2021 differed from the U.S. federal
statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to $7.0 million of tax expense for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset
for the future capital loss on an equity method investment that was not expected to be realized, $4.8 million tax
expense from non-deductible officers’ compensation, $1.7 million of tax expense related to a prior year and $1.4
million of tax expense from recording valuation allowances on U.S. foreign tax credits.

**_Net Earnings (Loss) from Discontinued Operations_**

Net earnings from discontinued operations reflect the results of the International Business and the Digital
Marketing Business. Net earnings from discontinued operations declined as a result of the completion of the sale of
the International Business in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Refer to Note 4 - Discontinued Operations for
additional information.

**_Net Earnings Attributable to CDK_**

Net earnings attributable to CDK for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 decreased by $783.4 million as
compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2021. The decrease in net earnings attributable to CDK was primarily
due to the factors previously discussed.

Total Revenue .................................................................... $ 1,673.2 $ 1,639.0 $ 34.2 2%

Revenues for fiscal 2021 increased by $34.2 million as compared to fiscal 2020.

Subscription revenue increased by $7.9 million due to an increase in average sites and revenue per DMS
customer site. DMS customer site count increased from 14,719 sites as of June 30, 2020 to 15,025 sites as of June
30, 2021. This increase was largely offset by the impact of the re-allocation of lessor revenue from subscription
revenue to other revenue for our Hardware as a Service (“HaaS”) arrangements due to our prospective adoption of
ASC 842 in fiscal 2020, and a decline in Partner Program revenue.

Transaction revenue increased by $19.9 million due to higher transaction volumes in fiscal 2021 as the
downturn in automotive retail activity caused by COVID-19 receded, as well as higher credit bureau charges
initiated in the second half of fiscal 2021.

Other revenue increased by $8.0 million due to higher hardware revenue including lessor accounting under ASC
842 driven by strong installation of our Cloud Connect product, partially offset by the COVID-related impacts in our
consulting and call center businesses.

**_Cost of Revenue_**

Cost of revenue for fiscal 2021 increased by $74.4 million as compared to fiscal 2020. Cost of revenue
increased due to higher employee-related costs and professional services to support our strategic growth initiatives
and other research and development activities as well as our revenue growth. Cost of revenue was also impacted by
a post-ASC 842 change in the timing of cost recognition for our HaaS arrangements, costs related to a transition
services agreement in connection with the sale of the Digital Marketing Business and the International Business, and
higher incentive compensation and employee benefit costs. The increase was partially offset by higher software
capitalization and lower employee travel costs in fiscal 2021. Cost of revenue includes expenses to research,
develop, and deploy new and enhanced solutions for our customers of $79.3 million and $49.6 million for fiscal
2021 and 2020, respectively, representing 4.7% and 3.0% of revenue, respectively.


-----

**_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_**

Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2021 increased by $22.2 million as compared to fiscal
2020. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher employee-related costs
consistent with increased headcount, and higher incentive compensation, partially offset by lower travel expenses as
a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**_Litigation Provision_**

During fiscal 2021, our reassessment of the litigation liability resulted in an increase of $12.0 million. For
additional information refer to “Note 18–Commitments and Contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**_Interest Expense_**

Interest expense for fiscal 2021 decreased by $19.5 million as compared to fiscal 2020 largely due to lower
average debt levels in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 largely attributable to the payoff of $250.0 million of
senior notes in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the repayment of the three-year term loan facility and five-year
term loan facility (“term loans”), and the 2026 Notes in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, respectively.

**_Loss on Extinguishment of Debt_**

Loss on extinguishment of debt is attributable to early terminations of debt. On March 1, 2021, we repaid the
indebtedness under the term loans. On April 23, 2021, we paid all indebtedness under the 2026 notes. As a result, we
recorded expenses of $18.5 million for a call premium related to the 2026 notes and $7.1 million for the write-off of
unamortized debt financing costs during fiscal 2021.

**_Loss from Equity Method Investment_**

For additional information refer to “Note 15–Investments for additional information on equity method
investments” in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**_Other Income, Net_**

Other income, net for fiscal 2021 increased by $15.8 million as compared to fiscal 2020 due largely to the
recognition of income related to a transition services agreement in connection with the sale of the Digital Marketing
Business and the International Business.

**_Provision for Income Taxes_**

Income tax expense was $94.5 million and $108.8 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The effective
tax rate, expressed by calculating the income tax expense as a percentage of Earnings before income taxes, was
33.2% for fiscal 2021, and differed from the US federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to state and local
income taxes, a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset for the tax basis difference of an equity method
investment that is not expected to be realized, a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits not expected to be
realized, tax shortfalls on stock-based compensation and non-deductible officer’s compensation. The effective
income tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 29.1%, and differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due
to state and local income taxes, a valuation allowance for capital loss carryforward credits triggered by a change in
estimate of the expected capital gain associated with the sale of the Digital Marketing Business, withholding taxes
on foreign earnings that are no longer indefinitely reinvested, offset by a benefit relating to a refund of prior year
state taxes.

**_Net Earnings (Loss) from Discontinued Operations_**

Net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations reflect the results of the International Business and the Digital
Marketing Business. During fiscal 2021, net earnings for the International Business increased due to the recognition
of the gain on sale of the International Business, the benefits from restructuring efforts at the end of fiscal 2020, and
lower travel costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by professional fees associated with the sale of


-----

the International Business and unfavorable currency exchange rates. During fiscal 2020, we completed the sale of
the Digital Marketing Business and recorded a total loss on sale of $96.3 million. Refer to Note 4 - Discontinued
Operations for additional information.

**_Net Earnings Attributable to CDK_**

Net earnings attributable to CDK for fiscal 2021 increased $826.8 million as compared to fiscal 2020. The
increase in net earnings attributable to CDK was primarily due to the factors previously discussed.

Revenue for fiscal 2020 increased by $46.0 million as compared to fiscal 2019.

Subscription revenue grew due to the ELEAD acquisition, an increase in average revenue per DMS customer
site primarily due to a combination of higher layered application sales, and a net increase in DMS customer site
count which increased from 14,681 sites as of June 30, 2019 to 14,719 sites as of June 30, 2020. These increases
were partially offset by pricing concessions, including customer discounts and credits in response to the COVID-19
pandemic.


-----

Transaction revenue decreased primarily due to a reduction in vehicle registrations and credit report activity
attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Other revenue increased due to a post-ASC 842 change in the timing of revenue recognition for our HaaS
arrangements.

**_Cost of Revenue_**

Cost of revenue for fiscal 2020 increased by $66.2 million as compared to fiscal 2019. Cost of revenue
increased due to the ELEAD acquisition, higher costs relating to investments in strategic growth initiatives, a postASC 842 change in the timing of cost recognition for our HaaS arrangements, and an increase in amortization due to
higher levels of capitalized software. These increases were partially offset by the cost containment efforts in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, impairment charges recorded related to certain intangible assets during the
second quarter of the prior year, and lower employee related expenses. Cost of revenue include expenses to research,
develop, and deploy new and enhanced solutions for our customers of $49.6 million and $57.6 million for fiscal
2020 and 2019, respectively, representing 3.0% and 3.6% of revenue, respectively.

**_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_**

Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 decreased by $18.3 million as compared to fiscal
2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased due to lower stock-based compensation expense
resulting from cumulative adjustments related to the achievement of financial performance metrics associated with
performance-based restricted stock units, certain expenses incurred in the prior year related to the business
transformation plan which was completed at the end of fiscal 2019, and lower travel expenses as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by costs related to the business process modernization program that began
during fiscal 2020.

**_Restructuring Expenses_**

Restructuring expenses for fiscal 2019 relate to our business transformation plan which was completed at the
end of fiscal 2019.

**_Litigation Provision_**

We recorded a $90.0 million litigation provision related to antitrust lawsuits during fiscal 2019. Additional
information on the litigation provision is contained in “Note 18–Commitments and Contingencies” in our
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**_Interest Expense_**

Interest expense for fiscal 2020 increased by $5.2 million as compared to fiscal 2019 due to higher interest rates
and higher average debt levels in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.

**_Loss from Equity Method Investment_**

During fiscal 2020, we recorded a $2.7 million loss related to an equity-method investment. In addition, during
fiscal 2019, we recorded a $17.0 million loss from an equity method investment related to the termination of a jointventure contract. Refer to “Note 15–Investments” in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum for additional information on equity method investments.

**_Other Income, Net_**

Other income, net for fiscal 2020 increased by $16.5 million as compared to fiscal 2019 due largely to the
recognition of income related to a transition services agreement in connection with the sale of the Digital Marketing
Business.


-----

**_Provision for Income Taxes_**

Income tax expense was $108.8 million and $48.6 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective
tax rate, expressed by calculating the income tax expense as a percentage of Earnings before income taxes, was
29.1% for fiscal 2020 and differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to state and local
income taxes, a valuation allowance for capital loss carryforward credits triggered by a change in estimate of the
expected capital gain associated with the sale of the Digital Marketing Business, withholding taxes on foreign
earnings that are no longer indefinitely reinvested, offset by a benefit related to a refund of prior year state taxes.
The effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 19.9% and differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily
due to a decrease in a valuation allowance related to the estimated capital gain associated with the sale of the Digital
Marketing Business, an increase in a valuation allowance related to a new capital loss generated from termination of
a joint venture, the benefit of US tax credits, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of state and local taxes.

**_Net Earnings (Loss) from Discontinued Operations_**

Net loss from discontinued operations reflect the results of the International Business and the Digital Marketing
Business. During fiscal 2020, net earnings for the International Business decreased due to one-time employee
termination benefits related to a restructuring plan and customer pricing concessions in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. During fiscal 2019, the Digital Marketing Business was impacted by a $168.7 million goodwill
impairment charge. On April 21, 2020, we completed the sale of the Digital Marketing Business and recorded a total
loss on sale of $96.3 million. Refer to “Note 4–Discontinued Operations for additional information” in our
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**_Net Earnings Attributable to CDK_**

Net earnings attributable to CDK for fiscal 2020 increased by $83.5 million as compared to fiscal 2019. The
increase in net earnings attributable to CDK was primarily due to the factors previously discussed.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and bank borrowings. At March 31, 2022, we
had cash and cash equivalents of $120.3 million to fund our general working capital needs.

Our primary cash needs are for working capital, capital expenditures, operating expenses, acquisitions, the
repayment of principal and the payment of interest on our indebtedness. Our historical change in net working
capital, excluding change in deferred revenue, has not been a material use of cash (averaging approximately $10.0
million use of cash annually). Change in deferred revenue has historically been a source of cash given the
subscription nature of our business.

To finance the Acquisition, we intend to issue the Notes offered hereby and, concurrently with the closing of the
Acquisition, enter into (i) the New First Lien Credit Facilities, initially consisting of (x) a 7-year $3,600.0 million
New First Lien Term Loan Facility and (y) a 5-year $650.0 million New Revolving Facility, with no amounts
expected to be drawn from the New Revolving Facility at the closing of the Acquisition and (ii) an 8-year $865.0
million New Second Lien Credit Facility (which includes an $87.0 million delayed draw portion for the refinancing
of 2024 Notes that remain outstanding after the Expiration Date of the Debt Tender Offers) subject to reduction by
the aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes (if any) that remains outstanding after the Expiration Date of the
Debt Tender Offers. We intend to use the proceeds from this offering and the borrowings under the New Credit
Facilities, together with equity contributions from funds affiliated with Brookfield, (i) to pay the cash consideration
for the Acquisition, (ii) to repay all amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Facility, (3) to pay the cash
consideration for the Debt Tender Offers, (4) to pay fees and expenses related to the foregoing and (5) for general
corporate purposes.

We believe that our current cash and equivalents, along with cash flows from operations and unused availability
under the New Revolving Facility will be sufficient to fund our current operating requirements over the next twelve
months. Our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and fund our capital and other requirements are also
dependent on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic and market conditions and
other factors that are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our business will generate


-----

sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings or equity financings will be available to meet our
liquidity needs. If we were unable to generate new contracts with existing and new customers, if the level of contract
cancellations increased, or if contract delays lengthen or increase, our cash flow from operations would be
materially adversely affected. We anticipate that to the extent we need additional liquidity, it will be funded through
the incurrence of additional indebtedness, equity financings or a combination thereof. We cannot assure you that we
will be able to obtain this additional liquidity on reasonable terms or at all. Although we have no current plans to do
so, if we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions or significant internal growth initiatives, we may
incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance such acquisitions or initiatives.

**_For the Nine Months Ended March 31, 2022 compared to the Nine Months Ended March 31, 2021_**

Net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased due to improved operating
performance and litigation payments made in fiscal 2021, partially offset by higher incentive compensation
payments in fiscal 2022.

Net cash flows used in operating activities from discontinued operations decreased due to the sale of the
International Business during the third quarter of fiscal 2021.

Net cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations increased due to a payment made for the
acquisition of Salty Dot, Inc. and increased investments in capitalized software.

Net cash flows used in financing activities decreased primarily due to increased borrowings from our revolving
credit facility and a decrease in term loan repayments partially offset by stock repurchases.

**_For the Year Ended June 30, 2021 compared to the Year Ended June 30, 2020_**

Net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased by $13.9 million due to
the timing of payments made to our vendors and tax authorities, and cash received from our customers in the normal
course of business including those related to our transition services agreement in connection with the sale of the
Digital Marketing Business and the International Business, partially offset by lower net earnings adjusted for noncash charges.

Net cash flows used in operating activities from discontinued operations increased by $172.3 million primarily
due to the tax paid on the gain on sale of the International Business in fiscal 2021.


-----

Net cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations increased by $365.8 million largely due
the acquisition of Roadster and Square Root, as well as an increase in capitalized software and capital expenditures.

Net cash flows provided by investing activities from discontinued operations increased by $1,395.1 million
primarily due to the receipt of $1.4 billion of net proceeds from the sale of the International Business in the third
quarter of fiscal 2021.

Net cash flows used in financing activities from continuing operations increased by $869.0 million primarily
due to the repayment of our term loans and the 2026 Notes in fiscal 2021.

**_For the Year Ended June 30, 2020 compared to the Year Ended June 30, 2019_**

Net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased by $53.4 million due to a
decrease of $122.2 million in net working capital components, which was primarily due to timing of cash payments
made for legal settlements; partially offset by lower income tax payments. Net cash flows provided by operating
activities from discontinued operations decreased by $54.6 million due to increase in cash used for working capital
associated with the Digital Marketing Business and lower earnings.

Net cash flows used in investing activities for continuing operations decreased by $514.9 million largely due to
the acquisition of ELEAD in fiscal 2019.

Net cash flows used in financing activities decreased by $3.1 million primarily due to proceeds net of
repayments from our term loan and senior notes; partially offset by higher cash outflows associated with repurchases
of common stock in fiscal 2019.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

As of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, we did not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item
303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions
that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting
policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. Estimates are based on historical
experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and
results could differ from estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant
management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial condition are discussed
below.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”).

We determine the amount of revenue to be recognized through the following steps:

  - Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;

  - Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;

  - Determination of the transaction price;

  - Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

  - Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy the performance obligations.


-----

The majority of our revenue is generated from contracts with multiple performance obligations. A performance
obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account
in ASC 606. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as
revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. We are required to estimate the total consideration
expected to be received from contracts with customers. In limited circumstances, the consideration expected to be
received may be variable based on the specific terms of the contract.

We rarely license or sell products or services on a standalone basis. As such, we are required to develop the best
estimate of standalone selling price of each distinct good or service as the basis for allocating the total transaction
price. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the adjusted market assessment approach,
with some product categories using the expected cost plus a margin approach. When establishing standalone selling
price, we consider various factors which may include geographic region, current market trends, customer class, its
market share and position, its general pricing practices for bundled products and services, and recent contract sales
data.

We apply significant judgment in order to identify and determine the number of performance obligations,
estimate the total transaction price, determine the allocation of the transaction price to each identified performance
obligation, and determine the appropriate method and timing of revenue recognition.

We generate revenue from the following four categories: subscription, on-site licenses and installation,
transaction, and other. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a
net basis; that is, such taxes are excluded from revenue.

_Subscription_

CDK provides software and technology solutions for automotive retailers and OEMs, which includes:

  - DMSs and layered applications, where the software is hosted and provided on a SaaS basis.

  - Interrelated services such as installation, initial training, and data updates; and

  - Prior to adoption of ASC 842, subscription revenue included technology solutions in which hardware was
provided on a service basis. This revenue was previously classified as subscription revenue because, under
lease accounting guidance in effect prior to ASC 842, substitution rights were considered substantive.

Revenue for SaaS and other hosted service arrangements, are recognized ratably over the duration of the
contract. We have determined its obligation under these arrangements is to stand ready to perform the underlying
services as required by the customer. The customer receives the benefit of the services and we have the right to
payment as the services are performed. A time-elapsed output method is used to measure progress as we transfer
control evenly over the duration of the contract.

_On-site licenses and installation_

On-site software arrangements include a license of intellectual property as the customer has the contractual right
to take possession of the software and the customer can either run the software on its own hardware or contract with
another party unrelated to us to host the software. The customer receives the right to use the software license upon
its installation for the term of the arrangement. As such, we have concluded that the software license is a distinct
performance obligation and recognizes the transaction price allocated to on-site software upon installation. We also
provide maintenance and support of the software applications. Such maintenance and support services may include
server and desktop support, bug fixes, and support resolving other issues a customer may encounter in utilizing the
software. Revenue allocated to support and maintenance is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as
customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given the support and maintenance comprise distinct
performance obligations that are satisfied ratably over time. A time-elapsed output method is used to measure
progress as we transfer control evenly over the duration of the contract.


-----

_Transaction_

We receive fees per transaction for providing auto retailers interfaces with third parties to process credit reports,
vehicle registrations, and automotive equity mining. Transaction revenue is variable based on the volume of
transactions processed. We have a right to payment as the transactions are performed in an amount that corresponds
directly with the value to the customer. As such, we recognize transaction revenue as the services are rendered and
in the amount to which it has the right to invoice. Transaction revenue for credit report processing and automotive
equity mining are recorded in revenue gross of costs incurred when we are substantively and contractually
responsible for providing the service, software, and/or connectivity to the customer, and controls the specified good
or service before it is transferred to the customer. We recognize vehicle registration revenue net of the state
registration fee since we are acting as an agent and do not control the related goods and services before they are
transferred to the customer.

_Other_

We provide consulting and professional services, including marketing campaign solutions, and sells hardware
such as laser printers, networking and telephony equipment, and related items. Consulting and professional services
are either billed on a time and materials basis or on a fixed monthly, quarterly or semi-annual basis based on the
amount of services contracted. After the adoption of ASC 842, Other revenue also includes leasing revenue from
hardware where the customer has a right of use during the contract term under ASC 842, as hardware substitution
rights are not considered substantive.

**_Income Taxes_**

Income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.
Management must make assumptions, judgments, and estimates to determine the provision for income taxes, taxes
payable or refundable, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our assumptions, judgments, and estimates take into
consideration the realization of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. Our income tax
returns are subject to examination by various tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such
matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.

We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be
realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future market growth, forecasted earnings,
future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we determine that it is more
likely than not that an entity will be unable to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, we would
increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which such a
determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will
be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance. In order to
realize deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the
jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.

We recognize tax benefits for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by
tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent
likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits are tax benefits claimed in our income tax
returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards. Assumptions, judgments, and the use of
estimates are required in determining whether the “more likely than not” standard has been met when developing the
provision for income taxes.

If certain pending tax matters settle within one year, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase
or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to
significant uncertainty. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the
income tax provision, the current taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a
revision become known.


-----

We account for the global intangible low taxed income (“GILTI”) tax as a period cost when incurred. The
GILTI provision is effective beginning in fiscal 2019.

Beginning in fiscal 2019, our accounting policy is to allocate goodwill impairment first to any permanent
portion of goodwill (when there is an excess of book goodwill over tax goodwill) and to record a period expense
when the impairment occurs.

**_Goodwill_**

We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit
is an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. We have three reporting units with discrete
financial information for each that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker when allocating
resources and assessing performance.

We test impairment by first comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the
carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the difference, up to the amount of goodwill recorded for
the reporting unit, is recognized as an impairment.

We estimate the fair value of our reporting units by weighting the results from the income approach, which is
the present value of expected cash flows discounted at a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, and the
market approach, which uses market multiples of companies in similar lines of business. These valuation approaches
require significant judgment and consider a number of factors including assumptions about the future growth and
profitability of our reporting units, the determination of appropriate comparable publicly traded companies in our
industry, discount rates, and terminal growth rates. An adverse change to the fair value of reporting units could
result in an impairment charge which could be material to consolidated earnings.

**_Long-Lived Assets_**

We review our long-lived assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is
measured by a comparison of the carrying value of the asset to its undiscounted future cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flow, an
impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. Given the
significance of our long-lived assets, an adverse change to the fair value of our long-lived assets could result in an
impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated earnings.

**_Assets Held for Sale_**

We consider assets to be held for sale when management, with appropriate authority, approves and commits to a
formal plan to actively market the assets for sale at a price reasonable in relation to their estimated fair value, the
assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition, an active program to locate a buyer has been
initiated, the sale of the assets is probable and expected to be completed within one year, and it is unlikely that
significant changes will be made to the plan. Upon designation as held for sale, we record the assets at the lower of
their carrying value or their estimated fair value, reduced for the cost to dispose the assets. Depending on the net
realized value from the sale, the potential charge could be material to our consolidated earnings.

**_Legal and Other Contingencies_**

From time to time, we are subject to various claims and is involved in various legal, regulatory, and arbitration
proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of its business activities, including those
noted in “Note 18–Commitments and Contingencies” in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
this offering memorandum. We routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to
these matters, as well as ranges of probable losses, by consulting with internal personnel involved with such matters
as well as with outside legal counsel handling such matters. We accrue for estimated losses for those matters where
we believe that the likelihood of a loss has occurred, is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable.
The determination of the amount of such reserves is made after careful analysis of each matter. The amount of such


-----

reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach such as a change in settlement
strategy in dealing with these matters. The inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in
amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution.

**_Business Combinations_**

We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which allocates the fair
value of the purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets
and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed,
management makes significant estimates and assumptions including discount rates and long-term growth rates. We
may utilize third-party valuation specialists to assist us in the allocation. Initial purchase price allocations are subject
to revision within the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related
transaction costs and other expenses associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

**_Interest Rate Exposure_**

We will incur variable interest expense with respect to our New Credit Facilities. As of March 31, 2022, on a
pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had approximately $5,215.0 million aggregate
principal amount of variable and fixed rate indebtedness, with a weighted-average interest rate of approximately
6.7% per year. A change of 25 basis points in the assumed weighted-average interest rate of such debt would
increase or decrease our estimated pro forma annual interest expense by approximately $13 million.

**_Foreign Currency Risk_**

We operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from
changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash
flows. We have not been materially impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a significant
portion of our business is transacted in U.S. dollars, and is expected to continue to be transacted in U.S. dollars or
U.S. dollar-based currencies. As of June 30, 2021, operations in foreign jurisdictions were principally transacted in
Canadian dollars. A hypothetical change in all foreign currency exchange rates of 10% would have resulted in an
increase or decrease in consolidated operating earnings of approximately $4.6 million for the year ended June 30,
2021.

We primarily manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities.

**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**

Refer to “Note 3–New Accounting Pronouncements” in our consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum for financial information regarding recently issued and adopted accounting
pronouncements including the effects on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.

_refer to CDK Global, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries after giving effect to the Acquisition described elsewhere_
_in this offering memorandum._

**Overview**

CDK Global Inc. is a leading provider of mission critical technology and SaaS data solutions for dealerships in
the automotive retail and adjacent heavy truck, recreation, and heavy equipment industries in North America. Our
solutions automate and integrate all aspects of operating a dealership and the vehicle buying and servicing process,
including the acquisition, sale, financing, insuring, parts supply, and repair and maintenance of vehicles. Enabling
end-to-end, omnichannel retail commerce through open, agnostic technology, we provide our solutions to both
dealers and OEMs and served over 15,000 dealer sites and adjacent businesses served across North America as of
March 31, 2022.

We generate revenue primarily by providing a broad suite of subscription-based software and technology
solutions to automotive retailers in North America, as well as to retailers and manufacturers of heavy trucks,
construction equipment, agricultural equipment, motorcycles, boats, and other marine and recreational vehicles. We
are focused on the use of SaaS and mobile-centric solutions that are highly functional, flexible, and fast. Our
flagship DMS software solutions are hosted ERP applications tailored to the unique requirements of the retail
automotive industry. Our DMS solutions facilitate most activities that generate revenue within a dealership
including: the sale of new and used vehicles, consumer financing, repair and maintenance services, and vehicle and
parts inventory management. These solutions also enable our customers to have company-wide accounting, financial
reporting, cash flow management, and payroll services. We also provide a broad portfolio of layered software
applications and services, a robust and secure interface to the DMS through our Partner Program, data management
and business intelligence solutions, a variety of professional services, and a full range of customer support solutions.
These additional products are integrated with the DMS and provide a full software solution suite to our customers.
Our DMSs are typically integrated with OEM data processing systems that enable automotive retailers to order
vehicles and parts, receive vehicle records, process warranties, and check recall campaigns and service bulletins
while helping them to fulfill their franchisee responsibilities to their OEM franchisers.

We believe we are the market leader in North America and have the largest installed base of DMS in the
industry. CDK has consistently grown market share and served over 5,600 customers representing over 15,000
dealer sites and adjacent businesses as of March 31, 2022, compared to 14,681 as of Fiscal Year 2019. Within the
core automotive space, CDK is primarily focused on the largest and most sophisticated dealerships, with 78% of
dealership customers having three or more dealer sites in fiscal year 2021, which positions the Company to benefit
from the consolidation trends in the industry. We are deeply embedded in our customers’ operations – the majority
of our customers use three to five CDK products on average, and our average customer tenure is approximately 20
years. The average customer contract length is approximately four years. In the LTM ended March 31, 2022,
approximately 78% of our revenue was generated from multi-year subscription contracts where revenue is tied to
customer site count, not transaction volume.

The strength of our business model is reflected in our financial performance. In the LTM period ended March
31, 2022, we generated approximately $1,763 million of Pro Forma Adjusted Revenue, which represents a 3%
CAGR since fiscal 2019, and $811 million of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, which represents a margin of
approximately 46% including $146 million of margin improvement initiatives identified by Brookfield.

**_Product Offerings_**

Our primary solutions include Dealer Management Systems, layered software applications, and value-added
services and solutions.


-----

Our flagship DMS software solutions are hosted ERP applications tailored to the unique requirements of the
dealer in multiple industries. Dealers use this software solution to manage critical business processes, including most
revenue producing activities as well as the system of record for accounting and OEM reporting. With multi-location
management ability, dealers receive real-time data with actionable insights to deliver immediate business
improvements. Our DMS products facilitate the sale of new and used vehicles, consumer financing, repair and
maintenance services, and vehicle and parts inventory management.

Complementary to our core DMS, we also provide a portfolio of layered software applications and services to
address the unique needs of automotive retail workflows. In recent years, we have strategically focused on
delivering solutions that solve key pain points for our customers. This includes consolidating technology vendors
within a dealer location and removing friction from the vehicle-buying experience. Specifically, we digitized critical
pieces of the sales process with products such as Connected Store, ELEAD CRM, Digital Contracting and eSign. On
an as-needed basis, we have also implemented installation procedures for our DMS and layered application products
on a fully remote basis to meet the needs of our dealers. Our acquisition of Roadster in 2021 provided capabilities to
enable dealers to sell new and used vehicles completely online, while also giving consumers the option to begin and
end the vehicle-buying process anywhere they choose – online or in-store. These solutions are often integrated into
and targeted at users of our DMSs, but may, in some cases, be provided to customers that do not otherwise use our
DMS.

We further connect the automotive ecosystem by providing third party retail solution providers with robust and
secure interfaces to the core DMS through our Partner Program. For both automotive retailers and OEMs, we
provide data management and business intelligence solutions through our open Neuron intelligent data platform that
extract, cleanse, normalize, enhance, and distribute billions of pieces of industry information and turn it into usable
data that provides actionable insights and products.

We also offer automotive retailers and OEMs a variety of professional services, custom programming,
consulting, IT solutions, implementation and training solutions, as well as a full range of customer support solutions.

**_Technology_**

To enable end-to-end automotive commerce, our strategy is to invest for the long-term in integrated software
products and an open technology platform that can deliver seamless, workflow-driven solutions for our customers.
The automotive retail market is evolving and demand for new and integrated technology solutions is growing –


-----

consumers increasingly expect a seamless omnichannel experience when purchasing or servicing vehicles; OEMs
see technology as a tool to ensure a consistent and positive customer experience across their retail networks; and
retailers are seeking integrated workflow technology solutions to help them improve both customer satisfaction and
dealership cost structure. We believe that the best way to compete in a world with numerous providers of
unconnected software solutions for numerous automotive retailers, OEMs, consumers, and vehicles is to provide
integrated technology solutions and platform tools that can connect the disparate elements to create continuous retail
workflows.

The DMS is a mission critical central software system that is connected to all aspects of the dealer technology
landscape – it enables the dealers’ day-to-day operations, and the replacement process can be complex.

**Industry Overview**

**_Dealership Consolidation_**

The dealership market in North America has experienced continued consolidation in recent years, with the
larger dealers (i.e. those with three or more dealership rooftops) driving industry growth. According to McKinsey
research, dealers with three or more sites have grown at a CAGR of approximately 1.4% since 2015 while the
overall number of rooftops has increased by approximately 0.1%. We expect this consolidation to continue, with key
trends such as increasing penetration of EVs and associated larger capital requirements further accelerating
consolidation. According to Bain research, approximately 66% of all automotive dealerships in North America are
expected to be owned by dealers with three or more dealerships by 2026, compared to approximately 50% in 2018.

_Source: Bain._

We believe CDK is well positioned to continue to benefit from dealer consolidation. Larger, more sophisticated
dealers have more complex software requirements and are CDK’s core customer. CDK offers a differentiated
product with ties to OEMs that can be easily adapted to handle the complexities of large dealer groups. In fiscal
2021 approximately 78% of CDK-served dealerships were owned by dealers with three or more rooftops. CDK has
a leading market share among the largest dealers and currently serves more than 60 of the 100 largest dealers in
North America. As dealer consolidation continues, we believe this will drive additional market share gains and
growth in site count.

**_Embedded Economic and Operating Moat and Regulatory Landscape_**

The dealership model benefits from an embedded economic and operating moat. While OEMs are using digital
platforms to optimize the customer journey, dealership networks remain integral to new and used car sales and the
service value chain. Dealers are a cost-efficient distribution method for OEMs, and dealerships remain an essential
part of the customer journey to provide an omnichannel experience. Consumers increasingly research potential
vehicle purchases online, but they still prefer to visit a dealer in order to test drive, complete the purchase and take
delivery. Consumers expect a seamless experience across digital and physical channels. According to research from
Cox Automotive, 72% of customers seek to finalize the deal in-store and 67% of ‘Gen Z’ consumers agree that faceto-face interaction is critical to the purchasing decision. In addition, the dealership acts as part of a nationwide
footprint of service centers for the OEM and helps ensure that a car purchased at one dealer can be serviced by all
dealers under that OEM brand.

The dealership industry also benefits from a favorable regulatory landscape. Every state in the U.S. has
franchise laws that protect existing franchise networks. Specific laws vary on a state-by-state basis but can include:

Outright prohibition on OEMs selling directly against their franchisees

Requirement for warranty service for vehicles and OEM parts to be provided through the franchise dealers

Constraints on ability to terminate franchises, allocate inventory, allocate incentives and impose restrictions on

dealer autonomy

The net impact of these regulations is that major OEMs cannot sell under existing brands except through their
dealer networks and even new entrants face limitations on their ability to sell direct-to-consumer. We believe these
elements create a robust and protective moat around our business.

**_Vehicle Electrification and Future of the Dealer_**

We expect the automotive market to continue its long-term transition to EVs and believe this transition will
reinforce the growing importance of large auto dealers. We believe CDK, with our focus and leadership in the large
auto dealer segment, is well positioned to capitalize on and benefit from this shift.

According to Bain research, EVs are expected to reach 33% penetration of North American light vehicle sales
by 2030 – gaining share but not significantly displacing ICE cars in the next decade. Given the inertia that exists in
the car parc, we expect this will be a gradual but sustaining transition. Incumbent OEMs are expected to account for
the majority of 2030 EV sales at approximately 27% of total light vehicle production. We also expect OEMs to
continue to sell EVs through dealers as the economics and regulatory limitations have mostly not changed with the
advent of newer technologies.

Dealerships will require substantial investment throughout this transition, including building out showrooms
and charging infrastructure and training their salesforce and technicians. We believe this required investment will
serve as a catalyst to further accelerate the consolidation trends within the industry, with the larger, better capitalized
dealers gaining share. As CDK is primarily focused on the largest and most sophisticated dealerships, we believe we
are well positioned to benefit from this trend.

Increasing penetration of EVs is also expected to improve the profit pools of larger dealerships. While EVs
include fewer serviceable parts than ICE cars, the total value of parts for an EV is on average approximately two
times more expensive than ICE cars due to the electrification systems, and more complex servicing requirements
and tooling investment are expected to result in dealers retaining a greater share of servicing from less equipped
third party providers. Higher warranty provisions provided by OEMs on EVs are expected to result in greater
revenue for dealers providing the service.

The OEM and dealer relationship landscape is also evolving. In the current landscape, OEMs have limited
control over pricing and there is a lack of seamless omnichannel experience due to limited OEM-to-dealer
connectivity and inconsistent practices among dealers. New entrants (both OEMs and online retailers) have created
stronger customer experiences, which is forcing OEMs and dealers to compete.

As the evolution continues, we expect OEMs to demand a consistent branded experience (including product
information and centrally managed pricing) and dealers will need to scale to provide a superior guest experience for
new and used car buying and ownership. This will necessitate close collaboration between the OEM and dealers. We
believe dealer consolidation will continue to accelerate and bolster the dealership importance to OEMs – both
parties will focus on providing an omnichannel digital retail sales experience, leading to more efficient inventory
and costs management.

**Our Strengths**

**_Clear market leader across automotive commerce software market_**

CDK has over 40 years of experience designing and implementing mission-critical solutions for automotive
retailers and original equipment manufacturers. We believe our core DMS software is the most comprehensive and
adaptive solution in the market, as evidenced by our having the largest installed base in the industry. We serve
approximately 9,200 auto sites and 6,200 sites across adjacent businesses as of March 31, 2022. Including DMS, our
digital retailing products and CRM standalone applications, we serve approximately 65% of the entire North
American market.

We also have the highest penetration among the largest dealers, which is the fastest growing segment of the
market. As of December 31, 2021 we served 5 of the 10 largest dealers in North America and 60 of the top 100.

To enable seamless, omnichannel, and end-to-end automotive commerce, we believe it is critical to provide
integrated technology solutions and platforms than can connect automotive retailers, OEMs, consumer, and vehicles.
Core to our leadership across automotive commerce is our partnership and presence across all major OEMs.

OEMs see technology as a tool to ensure a consistent and positive customer experience across their retail
networks. We believe OEM technology programs partner with us because of our installed base and differentiated
capabilities. Across the industry, luxury brand dealerships (e.g. BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi) are more often part of
larger, multi-site dealers than domestic brands (e.g. Ford or GM) or Asian brands (e.g. Toyota or Honda). As our
primary customers are larger, multi-site dealers, our penetration of luxury brands is higher than other brand
categories.


-----

(1) Market penetration of dealership sites for each OEM group calculated by weighted avg. share of respective

OEM brands.

We have been able to build our leadership in the industry through organic expansion and investments and
acquisitions, transforming from providing DMS to providing a suite of solutions that allow us to serve as a strategic
partner across OEMs, dealers, consumers, and developers. In fiscal 2021, approximately $540 billion of automotive
commerce transacted through CDK and 55% of all repair orders to dealers in the US utilized CDK systems.

**_Large and growing market with trends playing to CDK’s strengths and delivering new opportunities_**

CDK’s TAM is large, resilient, and growing. Our core DMS software solutions provide full-service ERP
applications to dealers and facilitate the sale of new and used vehicles, consumer financing, repair and maintenance
services, and vehicle and parts inventory management. Complementary to our core DMS, we also provide broad
portfolio of layered software applications and services, data management and business intelligence solutions, a
variety of professional services, and a full range of customer support solutions. Our open technology platform
allows us and third parties to develop adaptive and interchangeable APIs that can be used to connect existing
technology solutions and build new solutions reliably and quickly


-----

We have made these strategic investments and acquisitions to expand our TAM from our core DMS offering to
include all aspects of selling and servicing vehicles as well as data management and business intelligence solutions.
In aggregate, Bain estimates our TAM at over $16 billion as of January 2022.

_Source: Bain._

We believe the markets we serve are also poised to benefit from secular trends within automotive retail,
including EV adoption and dealer consolidation, consumer focus on seamless and omnichannel digital retail, and
increasing value in and complexity of servicing vehicles.

EV adoption is accelerating, and we expect this to drive increased dealer consolidation as the capital investment

required and technological complexities will favor larger, more sophisticated, and better capitalized dealers

OEMs, dealers, and consumers are increasingly focused on an omnichannel digital retail sales experience

Vehicles are becoming increasingly connected, with OEMs and dealers placing a premium on data management

and interoperability to deliver a modern service experience

We believe service is and will continue to be the biggest catalyst of dealer profitability growth, supported by the

EV transition

The automotive retail market is evolving and demand for new and integrated technology solutions is only
growing. As consumers increasingly expect a seamless omnichannel experience, we believe integrated dealer
technology will be essential for OEMs to ensure a consistent and positive customer experience across their retail
networks.

As a provider of solutions for all aspects of operating a dealership, with industry-leading innovative
technologies, a primary focus on larger dealers, and best-in-class software applications and data management, we
believe CDK is poised to capture the robust growth opportunities across our various markets.

**_Deeply embedded, mission critical software solutions driving robust retention rates_**

CDK’s DMS and CRM software solutions are tailored specifically to automotive dealers and are missioncritical to all core operations of a dealership. Our strategy is and has been to invest for the long-term in integrated
software products and an open technology platform that can deliver seamless, end-to-end automotive software
solutions to our customers.


-----

We believe we offer industry-leading software solutions and have cultivated deeply embedded and highly
strategic relationships with both OEMs and dealers over our more than 40 years of year operating history.

We believe our historical retention rates demonstrate the quality of our solutions and strength of our customer
and partner relationships. Since fiscal 2019 we have averaged 95% customer retention based on the number of auto
dealer sites and 100% customer retention based on auto site revenue contribution. In addition, we had an
approximately 92% gross retention rate for the LTM period ended March 31, 2022.

(1) Net revenue retention rate which is calculated by dividing revenue earned in a specific period by the revenue

earned from the same customers in the corresponding period of the previous year. Our calculation of Net
revenue retention rate for a given period only includes revenue from customers that were customers during the
corresponding period of the previous year, and excludes revenue from new business on boarded during the last
12 months.

**_Long-tenured, highly diversified customer base_**

CDK benefits from a large and long-tenured customer base that is highly diversified across both dealers and
OEMs. As of March 31, 2022, we served more than 5,600 customers across automotive and non-automotive end
markets that represented over 15,000 individual dealer sites. Approximately 60% of our DMS sites are in the
automotive end market, with the remaining 40% in adjacency end markets (including heavy trucks, construction
equipment, agricultural equipment, motorcycles, boats and other marine and recreational vehicles). Our primary
focus is on larger, more complex dealers with three or more sites. These dealers represent approximately 80% of
CDK-served dealerships as of March 31, 2022.

Across our entire customer base, the average length of relationship is approximately 20 years, which we believe
demonstrates the quality of our service offerings, value proposition to our customers, and embedded nature of our
solutions within our customers’ sites.


(1)


-----

Within our end markets we provide solutions to over 5,600 customers that represent more than 15,000 sites as
of March 31, 2022. Our largest customer accounts for 237 sites and just 4% of revenue, with the top 50 customers
accounting for accounting for 2,087 sites and 27% of revenue. Additionally, less than 10% of our revenue is related
to transactional volumes of car sales. This diversification insulates us from the risk of losing a customer or a
customer experiencing financial distress, as no individual dealer customer represents a material portion of our total
revenue.

Further, our base of automotive customers is also highly diversified by parent manufacturer. For the LTM
period ended March 31, 2022, General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis dealerships represented approximately 16%,
13%, and 12% of revenue, respectively. No other parent manufacturer accounted for greater than 10% of our
revenues. We believe the diversity in brands that we service further insulates our business from the risk of any
individual automotive manufacturer experiencing financial or other distress.


-----

**_Strong subscription revenue growth supported by consistent increases in new dealer sites and penetration of_**
**_layered applications_**

We generate revenue primarily by providing our suite of software and technology solutions under subscriptionbased, SaaS contracts. Our contracts are multi-year with revenue tied to customer site count, not transaction volume,
which provides a recurring revenue stream and stability to our financial performance. In the LTM period ended
March 31, 2022, approximately 78% of our revenue was generated from subscriptions-based contracts.

We have successfully been able to grow our subscription-based revenue through a combination of increasing
the number of dealer sites served and cross selling layered applications to existing DMS customers. We have grown
our number of sites both through organic new dealer wins as well as through the natural flow-through effects of
industry consolidation, whereby our existing larger dealer customers increase their site count. In the last six quarters
through the COVID-19 pandemic we have added 215 total auto dealer sites, bringing our total base to over 9,200.

We have also been successful in cross selling and increasing the penetration of our best-in-class layered
applications with our existing and new DMS customers. These layered applications have been a key driver of our
ability to increase our revenue per site, which has experienced robust growth through the last several quarters.

We have been particularly successful increasing the penetration of our ELEAD, CDK Service, and Roadster
layered applications.

CDK acquired ELEAD in September 2018 – ELEAD’s automotive CRM software and call center solutions

enable interaction between sales, service and marketing operations to provide dealers with an integrated
customer acquisition and retention platform

CDK Services includes CDK Appointment (convenient scheduling platform), CDK Lane (innovative inspection

tablet), and CDK Inspect (automated inspection process), among other value-add services

CDK acquired Roadster in June 2021 – Roadster’s CRM solution enables dealers and OEMs to sell vehicles

completely online, and to enhance the consumer retail experience


-----

**_Attractive financial model with highly visible and growing recurring revenue, strong profitability and cash flow_**
**_combined with actionable margin improvement initiatives_**

We believe our recurring, subscription-based revenue and highly diversified customer base provide us with a
resilient financial profile. These subscription contracts are multi-year in length, and our high retention rates
historically have provided us with a consistent base of recurring revenue from which to drive organic growth
through adding dealer sites and cross selling layered applications to increase the average revenue per site. In the
LTM period ended March 31, 2022, approximately 78% of our revenue was generated from these subscription
contracts in which revenue is tied to customer site count, not transaction volume. We have consistently grown our
recurring revenue base to over $1.3 billion in the LTM period.


-----

_Note: Recurring revenue refers to revenue generated pursuant to multi-year subscription contracts._

The Company has a high free cash flow conversion rate due to relatively low capex spend and working capital
requirements, providing a stable cash flow profile. The recurring nature of CDK’s revenue has contributed to an
average Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 41% and average free cash flow of $587.3 million over the past
three fiscal years.

We continuously invest in our business and technology which we believe helps us maintain our industry-leading
position and market share. In the last several years we have invested and re-deployed capital into early-stage growth
businesses, increases in corporate overhead and customer support, and technology modernization. These one-time
investments drove a modest compression in Adjusted EBITDA margins from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2021. Including
the impact of identified margin improvement initiatives, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the LTM period ended
March 31, 2022 was $811 million, representing a 46% Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our business also
benefits from relatively low capital expenditure and working capital requirements, which has driven a high Free
Cash Flow Conversion historically between 85% and 89% from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2021.

We have consistently achieved financial results earning status as a Rule of 40 Company, with combined
Adjusted EBITDA margin and revenue growth exceeding 40%.

**_Identified margin improvement initiatives_**

Our management team, together with external advisors and Brookfield, has identified an estimated $146 million
of margin improvement initiatives. Approximately one-third of these initiatives are related to customer operations,
which includes improved utilization of installation delivery teams, increased automation and offshoring, as well as
increasing managerial efficiency and removing redundant layers in targeted areas. Approximately one-third are
related to product and technology, which includes rationalizing resources and geographies, adjusting the DMS
Modernization roadmap and improving managerial efficiency. The remaining margin improvement initiatives are
related to improved productivity within the Sales & Marketing team, increasing General & Administrative
efficiency, and optimizing third party spend. We intend to fully action these initiatives within 24 months of closing
the transaction. Brookfield has a strong track record of successfully delivering on expected cost savings realization


-----

with its other portfolio companies and we believe we will be able to leverage their expertise to implement the cost
savings initiatives.

**_Highly experienced management team with proven track record of operational excellence_**

Our business is led by a highly experienced and qualified management team. Our management team has a
demonstrated track record of delivery value to our stakeholders as a publicly listed company. Our leadership team
have on average over 20 years of industry experience. See “Management.”

**Competition**

Our industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with a broad and diverse range of information,
technology, services, and consulting companies, as well as with the in-house capabilities of OEMs and dealers. Our
competitors range from local providers to regional and global competitors. However, we believe that no competitor
provides the same combination of customer focus and breadth of solutions that we do.

Each of our solutions faces competition from an array of solution providers. For our DMS solutions in North
America, our principal competitors are Reynolds and Reynolds, Dealertrack (Cox Automotive), Auto/Mate,
AutoSoft, Tekion, PBS Systems, and various local and regional providers. The most significant competitive factors
that we face across our solutions are price, breadth of features and functionality, user experience, quality, brand,
scalability, and service capability.


-----

**Regulation**

The automotive retail industry is highly regulated and automotive retailers and OEMs are subject to a broad
array of complex regulations governing virtually every aspect of their operations. Our customers must ensure their
compliance with their regulatory requirements, and, in turn, we must ensure that our solutions effectively address
their regulatory compliance needs.

Because our business delivers solutions across a broad spectrum of automotive retailer operations, our activities
are impacted by a wide variety of federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations. Central to the value of
our DMS application, for example, is that the forms we provide for our customers meet the requirements of their
applicable laws. Likewise, in our Vehicle Sales Solutions application, our electronic vehicle registration service is
dependent on our compliance with complex and detailed regulatory requirements. Across our portfolio of
automotive retail solutions, we are focused on ensuring that we meet our regulatory compliance obligations and that
our solutions enable our customers to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to them. See “Risk Factors—
Risks Relating to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters” for additional information regarding the application
and impact of laws and regulations on our operations.

**Privacy and Data Protection Regulations**

We are subject to a number of federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations regarding data governance and the
privacy and protection of personal data. For example, under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLB Act”), automotive
retailers are generally deemed to be regulated financial institutions and therefore are subject to the GLB Act and
applicable regulations, including the Federal Trade Commission’s (“FTC”) Privacy Rule and Safeguards Rule. In
our capacity as a service provider to automotive retailers, we generally commit to our customers that we will handle
non-public personal information consistent with the GLB Act and the related regulations. Similarly, many U.S.
states and foreign jurisdictions have adopted regulations that impose obligations on businesses that handle personal
information, including notification requirements in the event of data breaches relating to personal data, as well as
minimum security standards with respect to the handling and transmission of personal data. For a discussion of
privacy and data protection regulation and the potential impacts on our business, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating
to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters.”

**Seasonality**

Though our business is not highly cyclical, a portion of it is seasonal. Our Transaction revenue experiences
volatility around seasonal consumer vehicle shopping activity, and our Other revenue has a seasonal increase in the
third quarter of each fiscal year related to the services we provide to dealers in support of their year-end reporting
and tax filing obligations.

**Concentrations**

We maintain deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The
Company maintains deposits in a diversified group of financial institutions, has not experienced any losses to date,
and monitors the credit ratings of the primary depository institutions where deposits reside.

For fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, no customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue. As of
June 30, 2021, and 2020, no customer represented 10% or more of our accounts receivable.

**Human Capital Resources**

Our employees are our most valuable asset and are critical to our ability to deliver on our strategic plans. Our
success in delivering high quality and innovative products and solutions for our customers and driving operational
excellence is only achievable through the talent, expertise, and dedication of our team.

We recognize that attracting, developing and retaining skilled talent and promoting a diverse and inclusive
culture are essential to our long-term success. Our values – Be Open, Stay Curious, Own It and Create Possibilities
represent who we are and how we show up for each other and our stakeholders. These values inspire our employee
experience and the connection our employees have with the resources and tools to learn, grow and perform. We


-----

continue to make significant investments in talent development and recognize that the growth and development of
our employees is crucial to deliver for our customers.

The following are some of the investments we make in our employees, to align with our key priorities:

  - _Diversity and Inclusion (“D&I”). Our D&I strategy embodies our continuous focus around increasing_
representation, embracing an inclusive culture, and positively impacting our communities. We foster an
inclusive culture that creates a sense of belonging for employees, no matter their ethnicity, gender, race,
physical abilities or preferences. This inclusive culture encourages employees to embrace different views
which fuels innovation, sparks growth, increases productivity and enables the delivery of best-in-class
service to our customers. Our employee-led impact teams support the activation of our D&I and Corporate
Responsibility efforts across the organization to engage employees and deliver on our commitments.
During fiscal 2021, we launched a required Ignite Inclusion learning journey for all people leaders to
continue cultivating this inclusive culture that will help CDK and our customers win. To embed
accountability for these efforts, our D&I efforts are reflected in a component of our fiscal 2021 bonus plan
for all eligible employees.

  - _Thrive Continuous Performance Management (“THRIVE”). At CDK, we believe that everyone plays a_
distinct role in contributing to our business objectives. We empower our people to achieve their highest
performance and potential by building a culture of high-performing teams and growth. We enable everyone
to learn, grow, perform and accomplish tough goals. With THRIVE, employees own their performance and
career by aligning performance and development objectives with business priorities, and crowd sourcing
feedback all throughout the year. Employees and managers check in regularly to reflect on what’s gone
well, what could go better and how they are tracking against their goals. At year end, employees and
managers collaborate to conduct a year-end performance assessment that encapsulates both performance
achievements and demonstration of behaviors in line with our values.

  - _Pulse Real-Time Engagement (“PULSE”). Employee engagement is the connection that creates_
discretionary effort and commitment to the organization, our colleagues and our customers. At CDK,
employee engagement is a top priority for us. We strive to Be Open, and one way we live this value is by
providing employees with opportunities to share their feedback. The insights we gain through weekly
PULSE feedback is how we measure progress and share anonymous feedback with people leaders who are
empowered to take action to strengthen engagement in their teams. Through PULSE, we are consistently
evaluating how our people feel about our organizational priorities including engagement, D&I, and health
and well-being drivers.

  - _Learning and Development. We Stay Curious by enabling a culture of continuous learning and growth._
CDK offers a variety of learning and development programs and technologies that enhance our ability to
connect employees with meaningful learning content. We offer a variety of learning opportunities including
technical learning paths, professional skill development, and leadership development programming. Our
partnership with EdAssist reimburses employees for tuition costs for career-enhancing education. We have
also invested in LinkedIn Learning licenses for all CDK employees, offering more than 16,000 learning
items for employees to connect with throughout their unique journey.

  - _Health and Safety. We are committed to providing a healthy environment and safe workplace by operating_
in accordance with established health and safety protocols across our facilities while maintaining an
enhanced health and safety compliance program. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have
modified practices at our offices to adhere to guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and local health and governmental authorities in our global network. We have made investments
to provide oversight, enhance coordination and ensure robust safety protocols are present across our
operations. We believe that a healthy and safe workforce is an engaged workforce that is ready and able to
contribute to our success. In fiscal 2021, we added Health and Wellbeing questions to our PULSE survey to
continuously assess the mental and social well-being of our employees in real-time.


-----

As of June 30, 2021, we had a total of approximately 6,500 employees. We believe that relations with our
employees are good. None of our employees in the United States are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
We have statutory employee representation obligations with our Canadian employees.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are a party to ordinary and routine litigation incidental to our business. In addition, we are subject to two
purported class action lawsuits alleging anti-competitive conduct and anti-competitive agreements between the
Company and Reynolds and Reynolds relating to the manner in which the defendants control access to, and allow
integration with, their respective DMSs. While we believe the pending antitrust lawsuits to be meritless and we do
not expect the outcome of any pending litigation to have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity
or financial position we can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome. For a discussion of pending and
potential litigation and the potential impacts on our business, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Legal,
Regulatory and Compliance Matters.”

agreement with, among others, Parent, as borrower (in such capacity, the “Borrower”), and Merger Sub and after
giving effect to the Merger, CDK Global, Inc., a Delaware corporation, as co-borrower (in such capacity, the “CoBorrower” and together with the Borrower, the “Borrowers”), Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as
administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders party thereto, providing for the New First Lien Credit
Facilities described under the heading “The Transactions—Acquisition Financing Transactions.” The final terms of
the New First Lien Credit Facilities may not be determined until after completion of this offering and may differ
from those described below.

Under the New First Lien Credit Facilities, we expect to have the ability to increase the amount of first lien term
loans and/or first lien revolving credit facilities thereunder, or incur incremental equivalent debt, in an aggregate
amount not to exceed (a) a “fixed” amount equal to the sum of (x) the greater of $811.0 million and 100% of
consolidated EBITDA on a trailing four quarter basis, plus (y) any unused portion of the general debt basket “fixed”
dollar amounts that the Borrowers elect to reallocate to increase the amount of incremental first lien facilities, minus
(z) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of any incremental second lien term facilities incurred pursuant to the
New Second Lien Credit Facility’s “fixed” incremental dollar basket, plus (b) an additional amount subject to (i) if
such indebtedness is secured by a lien on the Collateral that is pari passu with the lien on the Collateral securing the
New First Lien Credit Facilities, the pro forma first lien net leverage ratio not exceeding the greater of (1) 5.50 to
1.00 and (2) the first lien net leverage ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such indebtedness, (ii) if such
indebtedness is secured by a lien on the Collateral that is junior to the lien on the Collateral securing the New First
Lien Credit Facilities, either (x) the pro forma secured net leverage ratio not exceeding the greater of (1) 6.80 to 1.00
and (2) the secured net leverage ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such indebtedness or (y) the pro forma
interest coverage ratio not being less than the lesser of (1) 1.75 to 1.00 and (2) the interest coverage ratio
immediately prior to the incurrence of such indebtedness or (iii) if such indebtedness is unsecured or secured on a
third-lien basis on the Collateral or secured by assets that do not secure the New First Lien Credit Facilities, either
(x) the pro forma total net leverage ratio not exceeding the greater of (1) 7.15 to 1.00 and (2) the total net leverage
ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such indebtedness or (y) the interest coverage ratio not being less than
the lesser of (1) 1.75 to 1.00 and (2) the interest coverage ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such
indebtedness plus (c) other customary prepayment builder amounts. The lenders under the New First Lien Credit
Facilities will not be under any obligation to provide commitments in respect of any such increase or incurrence.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

Amounts borrowed under the New First Lien Credit Facilities are expected to be subject to interest at a rate per
annum equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) for base rate loans denominated in US Dollars, a
base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the rate last quoted by The Wall Street Journal (or, if such rate
is not quoted by The Wall Street Journal, another national publication selected by the administrative agent in
consultation with the Borrower) as the U.S. “Prime Rate” in effect on such day, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate
plus 0.50% per annum and (iii) the applicable Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) (which shall not be less
than 0.00%) plus 1.00% per annum, (b) for term rate loans denominated in US Dollars, a rate determined by
reference to the highest of (i) the SOFR rate based on the interest period of the applicable borrowing and (ii) 0.50%
and (c) for loans denominated in Canadian dollars, the rate equal to the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (“CDOR”), as
published on the applicable Reuters screen page (or such other commercially available source providing such
quotations as may be designated by the administrative agent from time to time) (or, if such rate is unavailable, the
highest of (i) the interest rate publicly announced from time to time by the administrative agent as its reference rate
in effect on such day at its principal office in Toronto for determining interest rates applicable to commercial loans
denominated in Canadian dollars and made by it in Canada (each change in such reference rate being effective from
and including the date such change is publicly announced as being effective) and (ii) the interest rate per annum
equal to the sum of (x) the rate that appears on the Reuters Screen CDOR Page for Canadian dollar bankers’
acceptances having a term of one month on the date of determination as reported by the administrative agent (and if
such screen is not available, any successor or similar service as may be reasonably selected by the administrative
agent) and (y) 1.00% per annum (the “Canadian Prime Rate”).

-----

We expect to be required to pay an unused line fee to the lenders under the New Revolving Facility on the
committed but unutilized balance of the New Revolving Facility at a rate of, initially, 0.50% per annum, subject to
stepdowns upon the achievement of certain first lien net leverage ratios.

**_Mandatory Repayments_**

The definitive loan documents that will govern the New First Lien Credit Facilities are expected to require us to
prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with: (1) 100% of the net cash proceeds of any
incurrence of debt not permitted under the New First Lien Credit Facilities and debt incurred to refinance the New
First Lien Credit Facilities, (2) 50% (which percentage will be reduced to 25% and 0% if our first lien net leverage
ratio is less than specified levels) of our annual excess cash flow (as defined in the credit agreement that will govern
the New First Lien Credit Facilities) commencing with the first full fiscal year ended after the closing date of the
New First Lien Credit Facilities minus the amount of any voluntary prepayments of first lien term loans and certain
other debt, and any voluntary prepayment of certain first lien revolving facilities to the extent such prepayment is
accompanied by a permanent commitment reduction, in each case made (or committed to be made) during the
applicable calculation period (or, at the Borrower’s option, after the applicable calculation period and prior to the
payment due date) and further reduced by certain other amounts and (3) 100% (which percentage will be reduced to
50% and 0% if our first lien net leverage ratio is less than specified levels) of the net cash proceeds of asset sales or
other dispositions of assets constituting collateral pursuant to the “unlimited” basket (and including non-ordinary
course casualty or condemnation events with respect to assets constituting collateral) by the Borrowers or by any
Guarantor, subject to reinvestment rights and certain other exceptions. Mandatory repayments will be applied pro
rata across the first lien term loans, subject to certain exceptions.

**_Voluntary Repayments_**

We expect to be able to voluntarily prepay outstanding loans under the New First Lien Credit Facilities at any
time without premium or penalty, other than (i) customary “breakage” costs and (ii) a premium of 1.00% applicable
to any prepayment of the New First Lien Term Loan Facility that is made in connection with a “repricing
transaction” (subject to certain exceptions) that occurs on or prior to the 6-month anniversary of the effective date of
the New First Lien Credit Facilities.

**_Amortization and Final Maturity_**

The New First Lien Term Loan Facility is expected to amortize at 1% per annum in equal quarterly
installments, with the balance payable at the time the New First Lien Term Loan Facility matures in 2029. The New
Revolving Facility will not amortize and will mature in 2027.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

Certain of our direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries (and, at our option, other
subsidiaries of the Borrower) are expected to unconditionally guarantee all obligations under the New First Lien
Credit Facilities (with certain agreed-upon exceptions).

All obligations under the New First Lien Credit Facilities, and the guarantees of those obligations, are expected
to be secured, subject to certain exceptions, by:

  - a pledge of certain of the equity interests held by the Borrowers or any Guarantor subsidiary; and

  - a security interest in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets of the Borrowers and each
Guarantor subsidiary, subject to certain permitted liens and customary exceptions.

The liens securing our obligations under the New First Lien Credit Facilities are expected to be first-priority
liens on substantially all the assets of the Borrowers and the Guarantor subsidiaries, subject to customary exceptions
and liens permitted under the New First Lien Credit Facilities.


-----

**_Certain Covenants and Events of Default_**

The New First Lien Credit Facilities are expected to contain a number of covenants that, among other things
and subject to certain exceptions, restrict the ability of the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other
things:

  - incur additional indebtedness, including capital leases;

  - pay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire capital stock or certain junior indebtedness;

  - make investments, loans, advances and acquisitions;

  - enter into agreements with negative pledge clauses;

  - engage in transactions with our affiliates;

  - sell or dispose of assets, including the capital stock of our subsidiaries;

  - make certain fundamental changes, including consolidate or merge; and

  - create liens.

The credit agreement that will govern the New First Lien Credit Facilities is also expected to contain a leveragebased financial maintenance covenant, applicable only to the New Revolving Facility and only applicable if certain
exposures thereunder exceed a threshold amount on the last day of a fiscal quarter.

The credit agreement that will govern the New First Lien Credit Facilities is also expected to contain certain
events of default, including payment defaults, failure to perform or observe covenants, cross-defaults with certain
other events of default in connection with our other material indebtedness, a change of control and certain
bankruptcy events, among others.

**New Second Lien Credit Facility**

Concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition, we intend to enter into a second lien syndicated facility credit
agreement with, among others, the Borrower, the Co-Borrower, Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Group, L.P., as
administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders party thereto, providing for the New Second Lien Credit
Facility described under the heading “The Transactions—Acquisition Financing Transactions.” The final terms of
the New Second Lien Credit Facility may not be determined until after completion of this offering and may differ
from those described below.

Under the New Second Lien Credit Facility, we expect to have the ability to increase the amount of term loans
thereunder, or incur incremental equivalent debt, in an aggregate amount not to exceed (a) a “fixed” amount set at
the sum of (x) the greater of $811.0 million and 100% of consolidated EBITDA on a trailing four quarter basis, plus
(y) any unused portion of the general debt basket “fixed” dollar amounts that the Borrowers elect to reallocate to
increase the amount of incremental second lien facilities, minus (z) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
any incremental first lien facilities incurred pursuant to the New First Lien Credit Facility’s “fixed” incremental
dollar basket, plus (b) an additional amount subject to (i) if such indebtedness is secured by a lien on the Collateral
that is senior with the lien on the Collateral securing the New Second Lien Credit Facility, the pro forma first lien
net leverage ratio not exceeding the greater of (1) 5.50 to 1.00 and (2) if such debt is incurred in connection with a
permitted acquisition or other investment, the first lien net leverage ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such
indebtedness, (ii) if such indebtedness is secured by a lien on the Collateral that is pari passu with the lien on the
Collateral securing the New Second Lien Facility, either (x) the pro forma secured net leverage ratio not exceeding
the greater of (1) 6.80 to 1.00 and (2) if such debt is incurred in connection with a permitted acquisition or other
investment, the secured net leverage ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such indebtedness or (y) the interest
coverage ratio not being less than the lesser of (1) 2.00 to 1.00 and (2) if such debt is incurred in connection with a
permitted acquisition or other investment, the interest coverage ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such
indebtedness or (iii) if such indebtedness is unsecured or secured on a third-lien basis on the Collateral or secured by


-----

assets that do not secure the New Second Lien Credit Facility, either (x) the pro forma total net leverage ratio not
exceeding the greater of (1) 7.15 to 1.00 and (2) if such debt is incurred in connection with a permitted acquisition or
other investment, the total net leverage ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such indebtedness or (y) the
interest coverage ratio not being less than the lesser of (1) 1.75 to 1.00 and (2) if such debt is incurred in connection
with a permitted acquisition or other investment, the interest coverage ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of
such indebtedness, plus (c) other customary prepayment builder amounts. The lenders under the New Second Lien
Credit Facility will not be under any obligation to provide commitments in respect of any such increase or
incurrence.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

Amounts borrowed under the New Second Lien Credit Facility are expected to be subject to interest at a rate per
annum equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) for base rate loans, a base rate determined by
reference to the highest of (i) the rate last quoted by The Wall Street Journal (or, if such rate is not quoted by The
Wall Street Journal, another national publication selected by the administrative agent in consultation with the
Borrower) as the U.S. “Prime Rate” in effect on such day, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50% per
annum and (iii) the applicable Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) (which shall not be less than 0.75%)
plus 1.00% per annum and (b) for term rate loans, a rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the SOFR rate
based on the interest period of the applicable borrowing and (ii) 0.75%.

**_Mandatory Repayments_**

The definitive loan documents that will govern the New Second Lien Credit Facility are expected to require us
to prepay outstanding second lien term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with: (1) 100% of the net cash proceeds
of any incurrence of debt not permitted under the New Second Lien Credit Facility and debt incurred to refinance
the New Second Lien Credit Facility and (2) 100% (which percentage will be reduced to 50% and 0% if our secured
net leverage ratio is less than specified levels) of the net cash proceeds of asset sales or other dispositions of assets
constituting collateral pursuant to the “unlimited” basket (and including non-ordinary course casualty or
condemnation events with respect to assets constituting collateral) by the Borrowers or by any Guarantor, subject to
reinvestment rights and certain other exceptions. Mandatory repayments will be applied pro rata across the second
lien term loans, subject to certain exceptions; provided that no mandatory repayments on the New Second Lien
Credit Facility will be required until the New First Lien Term Loan Facility and any other debt secured on a pari
_passu basis with the New First Lien Credit Facilities, including the Notes, have been paid in full._

**_Voluntary Repayments_**

We expect to be able to voluntarily prepay outstanding loans under the New Second Lien Credit Facility at any
time after the first year following the Closing Date without premium or penalty, other than (i) customary “breakage”
costs and (ii) a prepayment premium of (x) 2.00% for prepayments occurring after the first anniversary of the
Closing Date and prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, (y) 1.00% for prepayments occurring after the
second anniversary of the Closing Date and prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date and (z) 0.00%
thereafter (in each case, subject to certain exceptions). Voluntary prepayments of term loans outstanding under the
Second Line Credit Facility prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date will be subject to a customary “make
whole” premium.

**_Amortization and Final Maturity_**

The New Second Lien Credit Facility will not amortize and will mature in 2030.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

Certain of our direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries (and, at our option, other
subsidiaries of the Borrower) are expected to unconditionally guarantee all obligations under the New Second Lien
Credit Facility (with certain agreed-upon exceptions).


-----

All obligations under the New Second Lien Credit Facility, and the guarantees of those obligations, are
expected to be secured on a second lien basis by the collateral securing the New First Lien Credit Facilities and the
Notes.

**_Certain Covenants and Events of Default_**

and subject to certain exceptions, restrict the ability of the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other
things:

events of default, including payment defaults, failure to perform or observe covenants, cross-defaults with certain
other events of default in connection with our other material indebtedness, a change of control and certain
bankruptcy events, among others. The New Second Lien Credit Facilities will not contain a financial maintenance
covenant.

**4.500% Senior Notes due 2024**

On October 14, 2014, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.500% Senior Notes due 2024
(the “2024 Notes”). Following the closing of the Acquisition, approximately $87 million aggregate principal amount
of 2024 Notes are expected to remain outstanding. The 2024 Notes mature on October 15, 2024. Pursuant to the
terms of the 2024 Notes, the interest rate adjusts from time to time and currently accrues at a rate of 5.000% per
annum. Interest on the 2024 Notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The 2024
Notes were offered and sold in transactions not required to be registered under the Securities Act. The 2024 Notes

On May 15, 2017, we issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Senior Notes due 2027 (the
“2027 Notes”). Following the closing of the Acquisition, approximately $62 million aggregate principal amount of
2027 Notes are expected to remain outstanding. The 2027 Notes mature on May 15, 2027. Interest accrues on the
2027 Notes at a rate of 4.875% per annum and interest is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of
each year. The 2027 Notes were offered and sold in transactions not required to be registered under the Securities

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

**General**

Certain terms used herein are defined under the subheading “—Certain Definitions.” In this “Description of
Notes,” (1) the term “Issuer” refers to Central Parent Inc., a Delaware corporation, and not to any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates; (2) the term “Company” or “Co-Issuer” refers to Central Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation,
prior to the Escrow Release Date and CDK Global, Inc., a Delaware corporation, from and after the Escrow Release
Date, and in each case, not to any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates; (3) the term “Issuers” refers to the Issuer and CoIssuer together, and not to any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates; (4) the term “Holdings” refers to Central Holdings
Inc., a Delaware corporation, and not to any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates; and (5) the terms “we,” “our” and “us”
each refer to the Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries.

The Issuers will jointly and severally issue $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of       % senior notes
due 2029 (the “Notes”) under an indenture (the “Indenture”), to be dated as of the Issue Date, among the Issuers and
U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”), Notes Collateral Agent (as defined
herein)registrar (the “Registrar”), Paying Agent (as defined herein) and transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The
Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
See “Transfer Restrictions.” The Issuers will not be required to, nor do they currently intend to, offer to exchange
the Notes for notes registered under the Securities Act or otherwise register or qualify by prospectus the Notes for
resale under the Securities Act or the state securities laws or under the securities laws of any other non-U.S.
jurisdiction. The Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or subject to the
terms thereof. Accordingly, the terms of the Notes include only those stated in the Indenture. The Issuers do not
intend to list the Notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the Notes in any automated quotation system.

The closing of this offering of the Notes may occur prior to the Completion Date. In that case, pending the
satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, the gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes will be placed in a
segregated escrow account (the “Escrow Account”). If the Escrow Release Conditions are not satisfied on or prior to
the Escrow End Date (as defined below) (or such earlier date as the Issuers notify the Trustee and the Escrow Agent
(as defined below) in writing that either (x) in their reasonable judgment the Acquisition will not be consummated
on or prior to the Escrow End Date or (y) the Merger Agreement (as defined below) has been terminated), then the
Notes offered hereby will be subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption at a redemption price of 100.0% of the
issue price of the Notes offered hereby, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date (as defined below). See “—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” The
funds in the Escrow Account will be released and applied to pay for any such redemption and any unpaid fees or
expenses of the Escrow Agent and the Trustee, with any excess amounts to be released to the Issuers. If the closing
of this offering of the Notes occurs on the Completion Date, the escrow provisions described herein will not be
applicable.

The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Escrow
Agreement. It does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the
Indenture and the Escrow Agreement, including the definitions therein of certain terms used below. We urge you to
read the Indenture and the Escrow Agreement because they, and not this description, will define your rights as
Holders of the Notes. You may request copies of the Indenture and the Escrow Agreement as set forth under “Where
You Can Find Additional Information.”

**Brief Description of the Notes**

Prior to the Escrow Release Date (if the Escrow Release Conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Issue
Date), the Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuers secured by a first-priority security interest in the
Escrow Account and all amounts on deposit therein.

From and after the Completion Date, the Notes will be:

  - general, secured senior obligations of the Issuers;

  - equal in right of payment with any existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Issuers;


-----

  - senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of the Issuers that is expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes; and

  - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of Preferred Stock and
other liabilities of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes (other than the Co-Issuer).

In addition, from and after the Completion Date, the Notes will have the benefit of a security interest in the
Collateral that will be (i) pari passu in priority with the security interest in the Collateral that secures obligations
under the other existing and future First Lien Obligations, (ii) senior in priority to the security interest in the
Collateral that secures obligations under the existing and future Second Lien Obligations and all other future junior
priority obligations secured by the Collateral and (iii) effectively senior in priority to obligations under the existing
and future unsecured obligations to the extent of the value of the Collateral, in each case, subject to Permitted Liens
and exceptions described under the caption “—Security for the Notes.”

**Guarantees**

Prior to the Escrow Release Date (if the Escrow Release Conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Issue
Date), the Notes will be guaranteed only by Holdings. From and after the Completion Date, Holdings and certain of
the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries other than the Co-Issuer (as detailed below) will guarantee the Notes. The
Issuer’s existing or future Foreign Subsidiaries and FSHCO Subsidiaries, any future Receivables Subsidiaries and
other Excluded Subsidiaries are not expected to guarantee the Notes.

The Guarantors will jointly and severally guarantee, fully and unconditionally, on a senior secured basis, the
performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all
obligations of the Issuers under the Indenture and the Notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any,
or interest on, the Notes or expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Indenture by
executing the Indenture or a supplement thereto.

As further described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted
Subsidiaries,” in the future, certain additional domestic Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that guarantee certain
Indebtedness of either Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor will guarantee the Notes, subject to certain exceptions and
subject to release and discharge as described in this “Description of Notes.”

Each of the Guarantees will be:

  - a general, secured senior obligation of the applicable Guarantor;

  - equal in right of payment with any existing and future Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor;

  - senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in
right of payment to such Guarantee;

  - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of Preferred Stock and
other liabilities of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes (other than the Co-Issuer); and

  - subordinated to obligations prescribed by statute, such as tax, social security and labor.

In addition, from and after the Completion Date, the Guarantees will have the benefit of a security interest in the
Collateral that will be (i) pari passu in priority with the security interest in the Collateral that secures obligations
under the other existing and future First Lien Obligations, (ii) senior in priority to the security interest in the
Collateral that secures obligations under the existing and future Second Lien Obligations and all other future junior
priority obligations secured by the Collateral and (iii) effectively senior in priority to all existing and future
unsecured obligations to the extent of the value of the Collateral, in each case, subject to Permitted Liens and
exceptions described under the caption “—Security for the Notes.”


-----

As of March 31, 2022, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions:

  - the Issuers and the Guarantors would have had $5,215.0 million in long-term indebtedness outstanding,
$3,600.0 million of which would have been pari passu senior secured indebtedness outstanding under the
New First Lien Credit Facilities, $707.0 million of which would have been junior secured indebtedness
under the New Second Lien Credit Facility and $158.0 million of which would have been unsecured
indebtedness, subordinated to the Notes to the extent of the value of the Collateral; and

  - the Issuers would have had availability to incur additional secured indebtedness of $650.0 million under the
revolving credit facility under the New First Lien Credit Facilities, reduced by the amount of borrowings of
loans and any letters of credit to be issued under such facilities on the Completion Date, subject to
satisfaction of customary borrowing conditions.

From and after the Completion Date, unless designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries in accordance with the
Indenture, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries.” Under certain circumstances, the Issuer
will be permitted to designate certain of the Issuer’s existing and future subsidiaries (other than the Co-Issuer) as
“Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Any Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in
the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes.

As of and for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 and the year ended June 30, 2021, before intercompany
eliminations, the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries represented approximately 8% and 8% of our revenues, 9% and 8% of
our Adjusted EBITDA and 5% and 5% of our total assets (excluding cash), respectively. In the event of a
bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding of any of the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, such nonGuarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade and other creditors before they will be able
to distribute any of their assets to the Issuers or a Guarantor. As a result, all of the existing and future liabilities of
the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including any claims of trade creditors, will be structurally senior to the Notes and
the Guarantees. The Indenture does not limit the amount of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness and that
may be incurred by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, including the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. As of the
Completion Date, Holdings and each Restricted Subsidiary (other than the Co-Issuer) that guarantees the obligations
of the Borrowers under the New First Lien Credit Facilities will guarantee the Notes.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the Guarantee
from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law. This provision may not,
however, be effective (as a legal matter or otherwise) to protect a Guarantee from being voided under applicable
fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce the applicable Guarantor’s obligation to an amount
that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. If a Guarantee or related security interest were avoided (in whole or
in part), it could be canceled or subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other
contingent liabilities) of a Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on
its Guarantee could be reduced to zero.

Any Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed
obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other
Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of
such payment determined in accordance with GAAP, but such contribution shall be subordinated in a customary
manner to the payment in full of the obligations under the Indenture and the Notes.

Each Guarantor may consolidate with, amalgamate or merge with or into or sell all or substantially all its assets
to the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or another Guarantor without limitation or any other Person upon the terms and
conditions set forth in the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or
Substantially All Assets—Subsidiary Guarantors.”

Each Guarantee by a Guarantor will provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged upon:

(1) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, any sale, exchange, issuance, disposition or transfer (by merger,
amalgamation, consolidation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such
Subsidiary Guarantor, after which such Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or


-----

issuance, disposition or transfer is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture
(including any amendments thereof);

(2) the release or discharge of the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor of Indebtedness
under the New First Lien Credit Facilities (in the case of Guarantors on the Completion Date), or the
release or discharge of such other guarantee or direct obligation that resulted in the creation of such
Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee or direct
obligation (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement will constitute a
release for the purposes of this provision, and that if any such Guarantee is so reinstated, such Guarantee
shall also be reinstated to the extent that such Guarantor would then be required to provide a Guarantee
pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of
Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”);

(3) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary
Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture or
the occurrence of any event following which the Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted
Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture or becomes an Excluded
Subsidiary;

(4) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Issuer, the Co-Issuer
or another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(5) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event;

(6) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” or in accordance with the provisions of
any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement then in effect with respect to the Notes;

(7) the exercise by the Issuers of their legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described
under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the discharge of the Issuers’ obligations under
the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; or

(8) in the case of Holdings, if Holdings ceases to be the direct parent of the Issuer as a result of a transaction
or designation permitted pursuant to the Indenture, provided that, if any successor Parent Entity
guarantees the obligations of the Borrower under the New First Lien Credit Facilities, such Person
assumes all of the obligations of Holdings under the Indenture and the applicable Notes Security
Documents, in each case, pursuant to supplemental indentures or other applicable documents or
instruments.

Notwithstanding clause (5) above, if, after any Covenant Suspension Event, a Reversion Date shall occur, then
the Suspension Period with respect to such Covenant Suspension Event shall terminate and all actions reasonably
necessary to provide that the Notes shall have been unconditionally guaranteed by each Guarantor (to the extent
such guarantee is required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of
Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”) shall be taken within 90 days after such Reversion Date or as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuers will issue an aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million of Notes on the Issue Date. The Notes
will mature on           , 2029.

Subject to compliance with the covenants described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation
on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Liens,” the Issuers
may issue additional Notes (“Additional Notes”) from time to time after this offering under the Indenture. The Notes
offered hereby and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for
all purposes under the Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase; provided,


-----

_however, that a separate CUSIP or ISIN will be issued for the Additional Notes, unless the Additional Notes are_
issued pursuant to a “qualified reopening” of the Notes, are otherwise treated as part of the “issue” of debt
instruments as the Notes or are issued with less than a de minimis amount of original issue discount, in each case, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Notes” for all purposes of
the Indenture and this “Description of Notes” include any Additional Notes that are actually issued.

The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 in excess
thereof.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of       % per annum. Interest on the Notes will be payable semiannually in arrears on each             and             commencing on             to the Holders of Notes
of record on the immediately preceding             and             (whether or not a Business Day),
respectively. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no
interest has been paid, from and including the Issue Date. If the Issuers deliver global notes to the Trustee for
cancellation on a date that is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, the
accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption date to the
Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the
applicable procedures of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) and no additional interest will be payable to
Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuers. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

**Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest**

Cash payments of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, the Notes will be payable at the office or
agency of the Issuers maintained for such purpose (the “Paying Agent”) or, at the option of the Issuers, cash
payment of interest on the Notes may be made through the applicable Paying Agent by check mailed to the Holders
of the Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders; provided that (i) all cash payments of
principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Notes represented by one or more global notes registered
in the name of or held by DTC or its nominee will be made through the Paying Agent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the registered Holder or Holders thereof and (ii) all cash
payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to certificated Notes may, at the option of the
Issuers, be made by wire transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States if
the applicable Holder elects payment by wire transfer by giving written notice to the Trustee or the Paying Agent to
such effect designating such account no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment
(or such other date as the Trustee may accept in its discretion). Until otherwise designated by the Issuers, the
Issuers’ office or agency will be the office of the Trustee maintained for such purpose in the United States.

**Paying Agents, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes**

The Issuers will maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes. The initial Paying Agent for the Notes will
be U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association.

The Issuers will also maintain one or more registrars and transfer agents for the Notes. The initial Registrar and
Transfer Agent will be U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association. The Registrar will maintain a register
reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time. The applicable paying agent will make payments
on, and the applicable transfer agent will facilitate transfer of, the Notes on behalf of the Issuers.

The Issuers may change any Paying Agent, registrar or transfer agent without prior notice to the Holders. The
Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as a Paying Agent, registrar or transfer agent.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar and the Trustee may
require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer of Notes.
Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The Issuers and the Transfer Agent will not be required to
transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection
with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer. Also, the Issuers and the Transfer Agent will not be required


-----

to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before the delivery of a notice of redemption of Notes to be
redeemed or between record date and payment date. The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of
the Note for all purposes.

**Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

The Issue Date is expected to occur prior to the Completion Date. In that case, concurrently with the closing of
the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuers will enter into an escrow agreement (the “Escrow
Agreement”) with the Trustee and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as escrow agent (the “Escrow
Agent”), pursuant to which the Issuers will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the gross proceeds of the offering of
the Notes into the Escrow Account. The Issuers will grant to the Trustee, for its benefit and the benefit of the
Holders of the Notes, a first-priority security interest in the Escrow Account and all amounts on deposit therein to
secure the Obligations under the Notes, pending disbursement as described below. The ability of the Holders of the
Notes to realize upon such funds or securities held in the Escrow Account would generally be subject to applicable
bankruptcy law limitations in the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuers. If the closing of this offering of the Notes
occurs on the Completion Date, the escrow provisions described herein will not be applicable.

The Issuers will only be entitled to direct the Escrow Agent to release the funds held in the Escrow Account in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent will
release funds held in the Escrow Account (the “Release”) to, or at the order of, the Issuers (the date of such release
being referred to as the “Escrow Release Date”) upon delivery by the Issuers to the Escrow Agent and the Trustee of
an Officer’s Certificate addressed to the Escrow Agent and the Trustee on or prior to January 5, 2023 (the “Escrow
End Date”), certifying that the following conditions (collectively, the “Escrow Release Conditions”) will be met
substantially concurrently with or promptly following the Release on the Escrow Release Date:

(i) (A) the funds held in the Escrow Account will be used to consummate, or in connection with the
financing of, the Acquisition, (B) the Acquisition will be consummated substantially concurrently with
the release of the funds from the Escrow Account and (C) the conditions precedent to borrowing under
the New Credit Facilities shall have been, or substantially concurrently shall be, satisfied or waived in all
material respects; and

(ii) each of the Issuer’s Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (other than the Co-Issuer) that are Restricted
Subsidiaries that guarantees obligations of the Borrowers under the New First Lien Credit Facilities on
the Escrow Release Date shall become a Guarantor of the Notes.

In the event that (a) the Escrow Agent shall not have received the Officer’s Certificate described above on or
prior to the Escrow End Date, (b) the Issuers shall notify the Escrow Agent in writing that in their reasonable
judgment the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Escrow End Date or (c) the Issuers shall notify
the Escrow Agent in writing that the Merger Agreement has been terminated (each such event described in clauses
(a), (b) and (c) above being a “Mandatory Redemption Event”), the Issuers will redeem the Notes (the “Special
Mandatory Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100.0% of the issue price
of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date, or from the most recent date to which interest has
been paid or provided for, to, but not including, the date of such redemption (the “Special Mandatory Redemption
Date”), which shall be the third Business Day following the Mandatory Redemption Event (or such date as may be
required by the applicable procedures of DTC).

On the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, funds will be liquidated and released from the Escrow Account in
order to consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption.

The Escrow Account will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to Holders of the
Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. In the event that the Special Mandatory
Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption exceeds the amount of the funds held in the
Escrow Account, one or more of the Investors will be required to fund the accrued and unpaid interest owing to the
Holders of the Notes, pursuant to a commitment provided by them.


-----

If at any time the Escrow Account contains funds having an aggregate value in excess of the Special Mandatory
Redemption Price as determined by the Issuers, such excess cash may be released to or at the direction of the
Issuers.

By its acceptance of the Notes, each Holder shall be deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee to enter into and
perform its obligations under, if any, the Escrow Agreement.

**Activities Prior to the Release**

Prior to the Escrow Release Date, the primary activities of the Issuers will be restricted to issuing the Notes,
issuing Capital Stock to, and receiving capital contributions from, Holdings or any other Parent Entity, performing
their obligations in respect of the Notes under the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement and the purchase agreement
with the Initial Purchasers, performing any obligations under the Merger Agreement and redeeming the Notes, if
applicable, and conducting such other activities as are necessary or appropriate in connection with the Transactions
or to carry out the activities described above.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

Except as described under “—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” the Issuers will not
be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payment with respect to the Notes. However, under
certain circumstances, the Issuers may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under the caption “—
Repurchase at the Option of Holders.” As market conditions warrant, the Issuers, Holdings, their direct and indirect
equityholders, including the Investors, any of their respective Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and
members of our management may from time to time seek to purchase the Issuers’ outstanding debt securities or
loans, including the Notes, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject
to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing the Issuers’ indebtedness, including the
Indenture, any purchases made by the Issuers may be funded by the use of cash on an Issuers’ balance sheet or the
incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under the Issuers’ then outstanding credit
facilities. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material.
Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the
attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series. In addition, any such purchases made at prices
below the “adjusted issue price” (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may result in taxable cancellation
of indebtedness income to the Issuers, which amounts may be material, and in related adverse tax consequences to
the Issuers.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, the Issuers will not be entitled to redeem the Notes at their option prior
to           , 2025. At any time prior to           , 2025, the Issuers may, at their option and on one or
more occasions, redeem all or a part of the Notes, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a
redemption price equal to 100.0% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus the Applicable
Premium as of, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption (the “Redemption
Date”), subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date falling prior to or on the Redemption Date.

At any time on and after           , 2025, the Issuers may, at their option and on one or more occasions,
redeem all or a part of the Notes, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at the redemption price
(expressed as a percentage of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on
the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the
Redemption Date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on             of each of the years
indicated below:

**Redemption**

**Year** **Price**

2025 ............................................................................................................................................................. %
2026 ............................................................................................................................................................. %


-----

**Redemption**

**Year** **Price**

2027 and thereafter ...................................................................................................................................... 100.000%

At any time and from time to time prior to           , 2025, the Issuers may, at their option and on one or
more occasions, redeem an aggregate principal amount of Notes not to exceed the amount of the Net Cash Proceeds
received by the Issuers from one or more Equity Offerings or a contribution to the Issuer’s Qualified Stock or capital
in respect thereof made with the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings, upon notice as described under
“—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to (i)            % of the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes being redeemed, plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date, subject
to the right of Holders of Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date falling prior to or on the Redemption Date; provided that (1) the amount redeemed shall not exceed
40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture (including any Additional Notes); (2)
at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued under the Indenture on the Issue Date
remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption (unless all the Notes are redeemed
substantially concurrently); and (3) each such redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of closing of the
applicable Equity Offering.

The aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be redeemed pursuant to the immediately preceding
paragraph cannot exceed the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds from the relevant Equity Offerings.

In addition, the Issuers may, at their option and on one or more occasions, redeem, upon notice as described
under “—Selection and Notice,” (i) at any time prior to       , 2025, up to 10% of the original aggregate
principal amount of the Notes (including Additional Notes) during any twelve month period at a redemption price
equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding,
the Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the Redemption Date, and (ii) at any time prior
to         , 2023, an aggregate principal amount of the Notes not to exceed the Non-Automotive DMS Business
Line Cash Proceeds at a redemption price equal to        % of the principal amount thereof, provided that at least
$300.0 million of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence
of each such redemption (unless all the Notes are redeemed substantially concurrently), plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the
Redemption Date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer, Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer or
Asset Sale Offer for the Notes, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes in such offer, and the Issuers, or any third party making
such offer in lieu of the Issuers, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such
Holders, all of the Holders of the Notes will be deemed to have consented to such tender or other offer, and
accordingly the Issuers or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior
notice, given not more than 60 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding
following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder in such offer (which may be less
than par) plus, to the extent not included in the offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but
excluding, the Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the Redemption Date. In determining whether
the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have validly tendered
and not validly withdrawn Notes in a tender offer, Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer or Asset Sale Offer, as
applicable, Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuers or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the
Issuers, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer, Change of
Control Offer, Alternate Offer or Asset Sale Offer, as applicable.

Notice of any redemption or offer to purchase, whether in connection with an Equity Offering, Change of
Control, Alternate Offer, Asset Sale Offer or other transaction or event or otherwise, may, at the Issuers’ discretion,
be given prior to the completion or occurrence thereof, and any such redemption, offer to purchase or notice may, at
the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion or


-----

occurrence of the related Equity Offering, Change of Control, Asset Sale or other transaction or event, as the case
may be. The Issuers may redeem the Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture, and a
single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions.
Any such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different provisions will have different Redemption
Dates. In addition, if such redemption or offer to purchase is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the redemption or repurchase date may be delayed
until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase was sent) as
any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in their sole discretion), or such redemption or
purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have
been satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in their sole discretion) by the redemption or purchase date, or by the
redemption or purchase date so delayed, or that such notice or offer may be rescinded at any time in the Issuers’ sole
discretion if the Issuers determine that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived. In addition, the
Issuers may provide in such notice or offer to purchase that payment of the redemption or purchase price and
performance of the Issuers’ obligations with respect to such redemption or offer to purchase may be performed by
another Person.

The Issuers, Holdings, their direct and indirect equityholders, including the Investors, any of their Subsidiaries
and their respective Affiliates and members of our management may acquire the Notes by means other than a
redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise.

**Selection and Notice**

If the Issuers are redeeming or purchasing fewer than all of the Notes issued under the Indenture at any time,
selection of the Notes to be redeemed or purchased will be made in accordance with applicable procedures of DTC;
_provided that no Notes in denominations of $2,000 or less can be redeemed or purchased in part._

Notices of redemption or purchase shall be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage
prepaid, at least 10 days (except as set forth in the seventh paragraph under “—Optional Redemption” or in
connection with a special mandatory redemption described under “—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special Mandatory
Redemption”) but not more than 60 days (except as set forth in the seventh paragraph under “—Optional
Redemption”) before the redemption date to each Holder of the Notes at such Holder’s registered address or
otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, except that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60
days prior to a Redemption Date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance or a satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture with respect to such Notes. The Issuers may provide in any redemption or purchase notice
that payment of the redemption price and the performance of the Issuers’ obligations with respect to such
redemption or purchase may be performed by another Person. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, any notice
of redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be
redeemed.

With respect to Notes represented by certificated notes, the Issuers will issue a new Note in a principal amount
equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note in the name of the Holder upon cancellation of the original
Note; provided that new Notes will only be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of
$1,000 in excess thereof. Notes called for redemption or purchase become due on the date fixed for redemption or
purchase, unless such redemption or purchase is conditioned on the happening of a future event. On and after the
Redemption Date or purchase date, unless the Issuers default in the payment of the redemption or purchase price,
interest ceases to accrue on the Notes called for redemption or purchase.

**Security for the Notes**

The Issue Date is expected to occur prior to the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions. In that case, the
Notes, during the period from the Issue Date until the Completion Date, will be secured by a first-priority security
interest in the Escrow Account and the escrowed property as described above under “—Escrow of Gross Proceeds;
Special Mandatory Redemption.”

From and after the Completion Date, the Notes, related Guarantees and other Notes Obligations will be secured
by security interests in substantially the same assets and property that constitute Collateral securing the First Lien
Credit Facilities Obligations but excluding any Excluded Assets (the assets and property securing the Notes


-----

Obligations, the “Collateral”), and will be secured on a pari passu basis therewith. Such security interests, including
their stated priorities, shall be subject to certain exceptions and Permitted Liens as described herein.

The security interests securing the Notes Obligations and the First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations will be
first-priority security interests in the Collateral (as described below). Such security interests are expected to be
granted to a Notes Collateral Agent (and not the Trustee (in its capacity as such)) for the benefit of the Notes
Secured Parties and the other First Lien Secured Parties collectively (the “Notes Collateral Agent”), in accordance
with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement
described below. As of the Completion Date, it is expected that Credit Suisse AG, New York Branch, the collateral
agent for the New First Lien Credit Facilities, will be the Notes Collateral Agent.

None of the Notes Collateral Agent, the Second Lien Collateral Agent or any Authorized Representative will
have any fiduciary or similar obligations to the Secured Parties pursuant to any Security Document (regardless of
whether the security interests granted pursuant to such Security Document secure any or all of the First Lien Credit
Facilities Obligations, the Second Lien Credit Facility Obligations, the Notes Obligations or any other Secured
Obligations), the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

The “Collateral” will consist of the following assets and properties owned as of the Completion Date or at any
time thereafter acquired by the Issuers or any of the Guarantors (collectively, the “Pledgors”), in each case, to the
extent otherwise constituting Collateral for the Notes Obligations (and not Excluded Assets): (a) all securities; (b) all
pledged equity and all intercompany indebtedness; (c) all intellectual property and all other general intangibles; (d)
all investment property; (e) all accounts, chattel paper, deposit accounts, documents, instruments, letter-of-credit
rights and commercial tort claims; (f) all equipment, inventory and goods; (g) all supporting obligations; (h)
extraordinary receipts constituting proceeds of judgments, indemnity payments and purchase price adjustments
related to any such property; (i) all books and records (including all books, databases, customer lists and records,
whether tangible or electronic); and (j) all collateral security and guarantees with respect to any Collateral, and all
cash, money, insurance, proceeds, condemnation awards and other proceeds, instruments, securities constituting or
evidencing pledged equity and financial assets received as proceeds of any Collateral, including proceeds of
business interruption and other insurance and claims against third parties.

The Collateral will exclude all assets that do not secure First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations at any time and
from time to time.

The assets that secure the Notes Obligations will exclude the assets described below (the “Excluded Assets”),
including as further described below under “—Limitations on Stock Collateral,”:

(a) (i) any owned real property and (ii) all leasehold, easement and other interests in real property interests
(other than fee ownership interests) and, except to the extent a security interest therein can be perfected
by the filing of an “all assets” Uniform Commercial Code financing statement (or equivalent filing under
a similar Requirement of Law), leasehold interests in any other assets;

(b) any governmental or regulatory licenses or state or local franchises, charters, consents, permits or
authorizations, to the extent the granting of a security interest in any such license, franchise, charter,
consent, permit or authorization would be prohibited or restricted thereby (including any legally
effective prohibition or restriction, but excluding any prohibition or restriction that is ineffective under
the Uniform Commercial Code or equivalent Requirement of Law of any applicable jurisdiction);

(c) any asset to the extent a pledge thereof or grant of security interest therein is prohibited or restricted by
any Requirement of Law (including any legally effective requirement to obtain the consent, approval,
license or authorization of any Governmental Authority, except to the extent such consent has been
obtained, other than to the extent that any such prohibition would be rendered ineffective pursuant to any
other applicable Requirement of Law, including the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable
jurisdiction) (with no requirement to obtain the consent, approval, license or authorization of any
Governmental Authority or third party, including, without limitation, no requirement to comply with the
Federal Assignment of Claims Act or any similar statute);

(d) any margin stock;


-----

(e) any asset to the extent a grant or perfection of a security interest in such assets could reasonably be
expected to result in non-de minimis adverse Tax consequences or non-de minimis adverse regulatory
consequences to Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent Entities (as determined by the Issuer in
good faith);

(f) any (i) Excluded Foreign Intellectual Property and (ii) intent-to-use trademark or service mark
application for the registration of a trademark or service mark filed pursuant to Section 1(b) of the
Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1051 (the “Lanham Act”) (1) prior to the filing and acceptance of a “Statement
of Use” and issuance of a “Certificate of Registration” pursuant to Section 1(d) of the Lanham Act or (2)
an accepted filing of an “Amendment to Allege Use”; provided that, upon the acceptance of a
“Statement of Use” or “Amendment to Allege Use” whereby such intent-to-use trademark application is
converted to a “use in commerce” application pursuant to Section 1(c) of the Lanham Act with respect
thereto, provided that upon the issuance of a “Certificate of Registration” or the accepted filing of an
“Amendment to Allege Use”, such trademark application will cease to be an Excluded Asset;

(g) any general intangible and any lease, sublease, license, occupancy agreement, permit or other agreement
or any property or right subject thereto (including pursuant to a purchase money security interest, capital
lease obligation or similar arrangement or, in the case of after-acquired property, pre-existing secured
debt not incurred in anticipation of the acquisition by the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or Guarantor of such
property) permitted under the Indenture to the extent that a grant of a security interest therein would
violate or invalidate such item or create a breach, default or right of termination in favor of or otherwise
require consent thereunder from any other party thereto (other than the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any
Guarantor) after giving effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions of the Uniform Commercial
Code of any applicable jurisdiction or other similar applicable Requirement of Law, other than proceeds
and receivables thereof, the assignment of which is expressly deemed effective under the Uniform
Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction or other similar applicable Requirement of Law
notwithstanding such prohibition;

(h) (i) any Equity Interests in excess of 65% of any first tier CFC or FSHCO Subsidiary, (b) any Equity
Interests or other voting ownership interests in any Subsidiary that is not a first tier Subsidiary of the
Issuer, the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor and (c) the Equity Interests of a Subsidiary (other than a Wholly
Owned Subsidiary) the pledge of which would violate such Subsidiary’s organizational or joint venture
documents that is binding on or relating to such Equity Interests after giving effect to the applicable antiassignment provisions in the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction;

(i) any Equity Interest and asset of any (A) Person other than the Issuer or a wholly-owned Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer, (B) Immaterial Subsidiary, (C) Unrestricted Subsidiary, (D) Limited Purpose
Subsidiary or (E) employee stock ownership plan or trust established by Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries or a direct or indirect parent of Holdings (to the extent such employee stock ownership plan
or trust has been funded by Holdings or any Subsidiary or a direct or indirect parent of Holdings);

(j) Permitted Receivables Financing Assets subject to (or otherwise sold, contributed, pledged, factored,
transferred or otherwise disposed of in connection with) any Permitted Receivables Financing;

(k) any Vehicle (other than to the extent a security interest therein can be perfected by filing an “all assets”
Uniform Commercial Code financing statement or equivalent filing and without the requirement to list
any VIN, serial or similar number or to file or revise any certificate of title of such Vehicle);

(l) any letter of credit right (other than to the extent a security interest in such right can be perfected solely
by filing an “all assets” Uniform Commercial Code financing statement or equivalent filing) or
commercial tort claim other than certain material commercial tort claims;

(m) cash and Cash Equivalents (other than cash and Cash Equivalents representing identifiable proceeds of
other Collateral, a security interest in which can be perfected solely through the filing of an “all-assets”
Uniform Commercial Code financing statement or equivalent filing), and any deposit, commodity or
securities account (including any securities entitlement and any related asset) (except to the extent a


-----

security interest therein can be perfected solely through the filing of an “all-assets” Uniform Commercial
Code financing statement or equivalent filing or automatically without a filing);

(n) Rule 3-16 Capital Stock;

(o) Excluded Accounts;

(q) any other assets to the extent that the Issuer determines in good faith that the cost, burden, difficulty or
consequence of obtaining or perfecting a security interest in such assets is excessive in relation to the
benefit to the holders of the Notes of the security to be afforded thereby or the value of such assets as
Collateral; and

(r) any other assets that do not secure the New First Lien Credit Facilities, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, if the New First Lien Credit Facilities shall become unsecured credit facilities (including pursuant
to any modification, refinancing or replacement thereof).

The security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes Obligations (other than as set forth in the following
proviso) will not be required to be in place on the Completion Date or perfected on such date, but the Issuers will be
required to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such security interests to be put in place no later than 120
days after the Completion Date; provided, however, the perfection of the security interests (1) in the certificated
Equity Interests of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer and, to the extent received by the Issuer after use of its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such certificates, the Issuer’s wholly-owned Domestic Subsidiaries (other than the CoIssuer) will, in each case, be required to be delivered on the Completion Date and (2) in other assets of the Issuer,
the Co-Issuer, and Domestic Subsidiary Guarantors with respect to which a Lien may be perfected by the filing of a
Uniform Commercial Code financing statement (or equivalent), which Uniform Commercial Code financing
statement (or equivalent) will be required to be provided as of the Completion Date. No assurance can be given that
such security interest to be delivered after the Completion Date will be granted or perfected on a timely basis. In
addition, the security documents will generally not require the Issuers and the Guarantors to take certain actions to
perfect the liens in certain of the Collateral, including, prior to the repayment in full of the obligations under the
New First Lien Credit Facilities, if such actions are not requested by the New First Lien Credit Facilities
Administrative Agent with respect to such Collateral. As a result, the liens may not attach or be perfected in certain
of the Collateral, which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of the Notes with respect to such Collateral.

In addition, Liens required to be granted from time to time pursuant to the Indenture shall be subject to
exceptions and limitations set forth in the Notes Security Documents, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement
described below, the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement described below and other applicable
intercreditor agreements and consistent with the New First Lien Credit Facilities, including that:

(i) the Indenture and Notes Security Documents shall not require the creation or perfection of pledges of, or
security interests in, or the obtaining of title insurance, legal opinions or other deliverables with respect
to, particular assets of the Issuers or Guarantors (x) if, and for so long as and to the extent that the Issuers
in good faith determine that the cost, burden or consequence of creating or perfecting such pledges or
security interests in such assets, or obtaining such title insurance, legal opinions or other deliverables in
respect of such assets (taking into account any non-de minimis adverse Tax consequences (including the
imposition of non-de minimis withholding or other Taxes) and any non-de minimis adverse regulatory
consequences, in each case to Holdings or its Subsidiaries or any Parent Entities, Affiliates or direct or
indirect equity owners thereof), outweighs the benefits to be obtained by the holders of the Notes
therefrom and/or (y) if the grant or perfection of a security interest in such asset would (A) be prohibited
by enforceable anti-assignment provisions of any applicable Requirement of Law, (B) violate the terms
of any contract (to the extent binding on such property at the time of the acquisition thereof and not
incurred in contemplation of such acquisition) (in each case, after giving effect to the applicable antiassignment provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable Requirement of Law) or (C)
trigger termination of any contract pursuant to any “change of control” or similar provision (to the extent
binding on such property at the time of the acquisition thereof and not incurred in contemplation of such
acquisition); it being understood that the Collateral shall include any proceeds and/or receivables (other
than to the extent constituting Excluded Assets) arising out of any contract described in this clause (y) to
the extent the assignment of such proceeds or receivables is expressly deemed effective under the


-----

Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable Requirement of Law notwithstanding the relevant
prohibition, violation or termination right;

(ii) control agreements or other control or similar arrangements shall not be required with respect to cash,
Cash Equivalents, deposit accounts, securities accounts, commodities accounts or other assets requiring
perfection by control agreements;

(iii) entry into any source code escrow arrangements or the registration of any intellectual property shall not
be required;

(iv) except with respect to a Designated Guarantor that is a Foreign Subsidiary (if any), no perfection actions
shall be required, nor shall the Notes Collateral Agent be authorized to take any perfection or other
actions, other than (x) filings pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code in the office of the secretary of
state (or similar central filing office) of the relevant state(s), (y) filings in the United States Copyright
Office or the United States Patent and Trademark Office with respect to intellectual property and
(z) subject to the Intercreditor Agreements, delivery to the Notes Collateral Agent to be held in its
possession of all Collateral consisting of certificated Equity Interests and other instruments, in each case
to the extent not constituting Excluded Assets and to the extent required to be delivered pursuant to the
applicable Security Documents;

(v) except, in each case, with respect to a Designated Guarantor that is Foreign Subsidiary (if any), no
actions in any jurisdiction other than the United States, a state thereof or the District of Columbia, or
required by the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States, a state thereof or the District of
Columbia, shall be required to be taken, nor shall the Notes Collateral Agent be authorized to take any
such action, to create any security interests in assets located or titled outside of the United States, a state
thereof or the District of Columbia (including any Equity Interests of Subsidiaries organized under the
laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States, a state thereof or the District of Columbia and any
Excluded Foreign Intellectual Property) or to perfect or make enforceable any security interests in any
such assets (it being understood that there shall be no security agreements or pledge agreements
governed under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States, a state thereof or the District of
Columbia and all guarantee agreements shall be governed under the laws of the State of New York); and

(vi) no Issuers or Guarantor shall be required to seek any landlord lien waiver, estoppel, warehouseman
waiver or other collateral access or similar letter or agreement.

Any periods of time for the taking of any action with respect to the granting of security interests with respect to
the Notes shall be deemed extended to the extent the same period is extended in respect of the New First Lien Credit
Facilities or by a person that becomes Applicable Collateral Agent as described under “First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement—Exercise of Remedies.” In no event shall the Issuers or the Guarantors be required to take any action
with respect to the Notes if the same shall not be required and taken in respect of the New First Lien Credit Facilities
(so long as outstanding).

The security interest securing the Notes Obligations will be pari passu in priority with any and all security
interests in the Collateral securing the First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations and any Additional First Lien
Obligations, and will be senior in priority with any and all security interests in the Collateral securing Second Lien
Obligations, including the Second Lien Credit Facility Obligations, in each case, subject to all other Permitted Liens.
The First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations (and any Additional First Lien Obligations may include) obligations in
respect of Cash Management Services and related obligations, as well as certain hedging obligations. The person
holding such First Lien Credit Facilities Obligations or Additional First Lien Obligations may have rights and
remedies with respect to the property subject to such Liens that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the
Collateral or the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral for the benefit of the
Holders and the other Notes Secured Parties. Pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, in connection with
any enforcement action with respect to the Collateral or any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, all proceeds of
Collateral (after paying the fees and expenses of the applicable agents and any expenses of selling or otherwise
foreclosing on the Collateral) will be applied pro rata to the repayment of the Notes Obligations, the First Lien
Credit Facilities Obligations and the other outstanding First Lien Obligations.


-----

The Issuers and the Guarantors will be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future which could share in
the Collateral, including Additional First Lien Obligations and Additional Second Lien Obligations, indebtedness
secured by a Permitted Lien such as purchase money liens that may be prior to the Liens securing the Notes
Obligations and additional indebtedness which may be secured on a junior priority basis to the Notes Obligations.
The Indenture and the Initial Intercreditor Agreements will provide that the Notes Collateral Agent, on behalf of the
holders of the Notes Obligations and all other First Lien Obligations, and without the consent of the Notes Secured
Parties, shall be authorized to enter into one or more intercreditor agreements with the holders of any such junior
priority indebtedness. Although not all holders of Notes Obligations will be party to such intercreditor agreements,
by their acceptance of the Notes, each agrees to be bound thereby. The amount of such other First Lien Obligations
and Second Lien Obligations will be limited by the covenant disclosed under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Liens”, and the amount of all such additional indebtedness will be limited by the covenant described under “—
Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock”. Under certain circumstances the amount of such First Lien Obligations and Second Lien Obligations and
additional indebtedness could be significant.

**_Limitations on Stock Collateral_**

The Capital Stock and securities of a Subsidiary of Holdings that are owned by Holdings, the Issuer, the CoIssuer or any other Guarantor will constitute Collateral only to the extent that such Capital Stock and securities can
secure the Notes without Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act (or any other law, rule or regulation)
requiring separate financial statements of such Subsidiary to be filed with the SEC (or any other governmental
agency). In the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act requires or is amended, modified or
interpreted by the SEC to require (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation
is adopted, which would require) the filing with the SEC (or Subsidiary’s Capital Stock or securities secure the
Notes or any Guarantee, then the Capital Stock and/or securities of such Subsidiary shall automatically be deemed
not to be part of the Collateral securing the Notes (but only to the extent necessary to not be subject to such
requirement) (such Capital Stock, the “Rule 3-16 Capital Stock”). In such event, the Notes Security Documents may
be amended or modified, without the consent of the Trustee or any holder of Notes, to the extent necessary to release
the security interests on the shares of Capital Stock and securities that are so deemed to no longer constitute part of
the Collateral.

In the event that Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act is amended, modified or interpreted by
the SEC to permit (or is replaced with another rule or regulation, or any other law, rule or regulation is adopted,
which would permit) such Subsidiary’s Capital Stock or securities to secure the Notes in excess of the amount then
pledged without the filing with the SEC (or any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of any
Subsidiary due to the fact that such any other governmental agency) of separate financial statements of such
Subsidiary, then the Capital Stock and/or securities of such Subsidiary shall automatically be deemed to be a part of
the Collateral (but only to the extent that will not result in such Subsidiary being subject to any such financial
statement requirement). In such event, the Notes Security Documents may be amended or modified, without the
consent of the Trustee or any holder of Notes, to the extent necessary to subject to the Liens under the Notes
Security Documents such additional Capital Stock and securities, on the terms contemplated herein.

**_After-Acquired Collateral_**

From and after the Completion Date, and subject to certain limitations and exceptions, if the Issuer, the CoIssuer or any Guarantor acquires any property or rights which are of a type constituting Collateral under any Notes
Security Document (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Excluded Assets or assets not required to be
Collateral pursuant to the Indenture or the Notes Security Documents), it will be required to execute and deliver
such security instruments, financing statements and such certificates as are required under the Indenture or any
Notes Security Document to vest in the Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Notes Secured Parties a
perfected security interest (subject to Permitted Liens, including any pari passu liens that secure any other First Lien
Obligations and junior liens that secure Second Lien Obligations) in such after-acquired collateral and to take such
actions to add such after-acquired collateral to the Collateral, and thereupon all provisions of the Indenture and the
Notes Security Documents relating to the Collateral shall be deemed to relate to such after-acquired collateral to the
same extent and with the same force and effect. For the avoidance of doubt, opinions of counsel will not be required
in connection with the addition of new Guarantors or in connection with such Guarantors entering into the Notes


-----

Security Documents or to vest in the Notes Collateral Agent a perfected security interest in after-acquired collateral
owned by such Guarantors.

**_First Lien Intercreditor Agreement_**

The Notes Collateral Agent, the Trustee and the First Lien Credit Facilities Administrative Agent will enter into
an intercreditor agreement (as the same may be amended from time to time, the “First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement”) with respect to the Shared Collateral, which may be amended from time to time without the consent of
the holders to add Additional First Lien Obligations and Additional Authorized Representatives therefor. Although
not all holders of First Lien Obligations are parties to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, by their acceptance of
the instruments evidencing such obligations, each agrees to be bound thereby. All references to the First Lien
Obligations in this “Description of Notes” shall refer only to such First Lien Obligations, and all references to the
First Lien Secured Parties in this “Description of Notes” shall refer only to First Lien Secured Parties, in each case,
subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (and in the event any Additional First Lien Obligations are in the
future created, the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor
Agreement, as described herein, may be amended without the consent of the holders to provide therefor).

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, only the “Applicable Authorized Representative” or “Applicable
Collateral Agent” will have the right to act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral. The
Applicable Authorized Representative will initially be the First Lien Credit Facilities Administrative Agent and will
remain the First Lien Credit Facilities Administrative Agent until the earlier of (1) the discharge of First Lien Credit
Facilities Obligations and (2) the Non-Applicable Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (as defined below)
(such earlier date, the “Applicable Authorized Representative Change Date”). After the Applicable Authorized
Representative Change Date, the Applicable Authorized Representative will be the representative (other than the
First Lien Credit Facilities Administrative Agent) of the Series of First Lien Obligations that constitutes the largest
outstanding principal amount of any then outstanding Series of First Lien Obligations as such representative is
notified by the Issuer (excluding the Series constituting the obligations under the New First Lien Credit Facilities)
with respect to such Shared Collateral, but solely to the extent that such Series of First Lien Obligations has a larger
aggregate principal amount than the Series of obligations then outstanding under the New First Lien Credit Facilities
as determined by the Issuer (the “Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative”).

With respect to any Shared Collateral, no representative of a Series of First Lien Obligations that is not the
Applicable Authorized Representative (“Non-Applicable Authorized Representative”), the Applicable Collateral
Agent or the holders of indebtedness for which such Non-Applicable Authorized Representative is a representative
(“Non-Controlling Secured Party”) shall be permitted to instruct the Applicable Authorized Representative or
Applicable Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek
to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator, examiner or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take
possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its
security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Shared Collateral or
have a right to consent to any such action. Only the Applicable Authorized Representative and/or the Applicable
Collateral Agent shall be entitled to take any such actions or exercise any such remedies with respect to Shared
Collateral.

The “Non-Applicable Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any NonApplicable Authorized Representative, the date that is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period such NonApplicable Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative) after the
occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for the applicable Series
of First Lien Obligations, and (b) the Applicable Authorized Representative and each other representative of First
Lien Obligations’ (each such representative of First Lien Obligations, a “First Priority Collateral Agent”) receipt of
written notice from such Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Non-Applicable
Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Applicable Authorized Representative and that an event of default, as
defined in the indenture or other debt facility for that Series of First Lien Obligations has occurred and is continuing
and (ii) the First Lien Obligations of that Series with respect to which such Major Non-Applicable Authorized
Representative is the Authorized Representative are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of
acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the indenture or debt facility for that Series of First Lien
Obligations; provided that the Non-Applicable Authorized Representative Enforcement Date will be stayed and will
not occur and will be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (1) at any time the


-----

Applicable Authorized Representative has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with
respect to a material portion of Shared Collateral or (2) at any time the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or the Guarantor that
has granted a security interest in such Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise
subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

The Applicable Authorized Representative and the Applicable Collateral Agent will each initially be the First
Lien Credit Facilities Administrative Agent, and the Notes Collateral Agent will not have any rights to take any
action under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Shared Collateral unless and until the Trustee
becomes the Applicable Authorized Representative and the Notes Collateral Agent becomes the Applicable
Collateral Agent.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens on Shared Collateral, the Applicable Authorized Representative
may deal with the Shared Collateral as if the Applicable Authorized Representative had a senior Lien on such
Shared Collateral. No Non-Applicable Authorized Representative or Non-Controlling Secured Party will be
permitted to contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Applicable Authorized
Representative or any holders of indebtedness for which the Applicable Authorized Representative is a
representative (“Controlling Secured Party”) or any other exercise by the Applicable Authorized Representative or
any Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Shared Collateral. Each of the Holders of
the notes and secured parties under the New First Lien Credit Facilities and the holders of any additional first lien
debt that may be issued in the future that is subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (collectively, the “First
Priority Secured Parties” and each a “First Priority Secured Party”) also will agree that they will not contest or
support any other person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the
perfection, priority, validity, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Priority
Secured Parties in all or any part of the Shared Collateral, or the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement.

If an Event of Default or an event of default under any document governing a Series of First Lien Obligations
has occurred and is continuing and the Applicable Authorized Representative or the Applicable Collateral Agent is
taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any
Shared Collateral in any bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring case of the Issuer or Co-Issuer or any Guarantor
(including any adequate protection payments), or any First Priority Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to
any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared
Collateral, then the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Shared Collateral by any First
Priority Collateral Agent or any First Priority Secured Party and proceeds of any such distribution or payment
(subject, in the case of any such proceeds, payments, and distributions, to the paragraph immediately following)
shall be applied among the First Lien Obligations to the payment in full of the First Lien Obligations on a ratable
basis, after payment of all amounts owing to each First Priority Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such); provided
that following the commencement of any bankruptcy, insolvency or restructuring case of the Issuer or any other
Guarantor, solely for purposes of the waterfall provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and not any
other document with respect to any First Lien Obligation, in the event the value of the Shared Collateral is not
sufficient for the entire amount of post-petition interest, fees, and expenses on the First Lien Obligations to be
allowed under Sections 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy
Code or other applicable law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the amount of First Lien Obligations of
each Series of First Lien Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of post-petition interest, fees, and
expenses allowable under Sections 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the
Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

The First Priority Secured Parties of each Series will agree that the holders of First Lien Obligations of such
Series (and not the First Priority Secured Parties of any other Series) bear the risk of (i) any determination by a court
of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series are unenforceable under applicable
law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations), (y) any of the
First Lien Obligations of such Series do not have an enforceable security interest in any of the Shared Collateral
securing any other Series of First Lien Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security interest exists securing any
other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest
of such Series of First Lien Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien
Obligations or (ii) the existence of any Shared Collateral for any other Series of First Lien Obligations that is not


-----

Shared Collateral (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) with respect to any Series of First
Lien Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series); provided that the existence of a maximum claim with respect to
any properties subject to a Mortgage (as defined in the New First Lien Credit Facilities (or the equivalent provision
thereof)) which applies to all First Lien Obligations shall not be deemed to be an Impairment of any Series of First
Lien Obligations. In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, the results of
such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations, and the rights of the
holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in
respect of such Series of First Lien Obligations permitted by the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the
First Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment
are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such First Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment.

Additionally, in the event the First Lien Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law
(including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code), any reference to such First Lien
Obligations or the Security Documents governing such First Lien Obligations will be deemed to refer to such
obligations or such documents as so modified.

None of the First Priority Secured Parties may institute in any bankruptcy case or other proceeding any claim
against the Applicable Authorized Representative or any other First Priority Secured Party seeking damages from or
other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared Collateral. None of
the First Priority Secured Parties may challenge, or support any other Person in challenging, in any proceeding
(including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding) the validity or enforceability of any First Lien Obligations of
any Series or any first priority security document or the validity, attachment, perfection or priority of any Lien under
any first priority security document or the validity or enforceability of the priorities, rights or duties established by
or other provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. None of the First Priority Secured Parties may take or
cause to be taken any action the purpose or intent of which is, or could be, to interfere, hinder or delay, in any
manner, whether by judicial proceedings or otherwise, any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Shared Collateral
by the Applicable Authorized Representative or Applicable Collateral Agent. In addition, none of the First Priority
Secured Parties may seek to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other
disposition of such Shared Collateral. If any First Priority Secured Party obtains possession of any Shared Collateral
or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to any Security Document or by the exercise of any
rights available to it under applicable law or in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or through any other
exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each
of the First Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other
First Priority Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Applicable
Authorized Representative to be distributed in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative
forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition
thereof, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of
the other First Priority Collateral Agents for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the notes and each other
Series of First Priority Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged
upon conclusion of the applicable foreclosure proceeding or other exercise of remedies. However, any proceeds of
any Shared Collateral realized therefrom will be applied as described in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that if the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Guarantor
becomes subject to a bankruptcy case and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of debtor-inpossession financing to be provided by one or more lenders under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code (or any
equivalent provision of any other applicable debtor relief law) and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of
the Bankruptcy Code (or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable debtor relief law), each First
Priority Secured Party will agree that it will not oppose and will raise no objection to any such financing or to any
Liens on the Shared Collateral (including by joining or supporting any such objection by any other Person) securing
the same and/or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless the Applicable Authorized
Representative with respect to such Shared Collateral opposes or objects (or joins in any opposition or objection) to
such debtor-in-possession financing or such debtor-in-possession financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to
the extent that such debtor-in-possession financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for
the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with


-----

respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any
Liens of any First Priority Secured Parties constituting debtor-in-possession financing Liens) are subordinated
thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such debtor-in-possession financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any
such Shared Collateral granted to secure the First Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each NonControlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as:

(A) the First Priority Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared
Collateral pledged to the debtor-in-possession financing lenders, including proceeds thereof
arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other
First Priority Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Priority Secured Parties
constituting debtor-in-possession financing liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the
insolvency or liquidation proceedings;

(B) the First Priority Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional or replacement
collateral pledged to any First Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in
connection with such debtor-in-possession financing and/or use of cash collateral, with the same
priority vis-a-vis the First Priority Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Priority
Secured Parties constituting debtor-in-possession financing Liens) as set forth in the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement;

(C) if any amount of such debtor-in-possession financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any
of the First Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement; and

(D) if any First Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection with respect to the First Lien
Obligations subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, including in the form of periodic
payments, in connection with such debtor-in-possessions financing and/or use of cash collateral,
the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement;

_provided that the First Priority Secured Parties of each Series will have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to_
secure the debtor-in-possession financing over any collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First Priority Secured
Parties of such Series or its or their representative that do not constitute Shared Collateral; and provided, further,
that any First Priority Secured Parties receiving adequate protection will not object to any other First Priority
Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First Priority
Secured Parties in connection with a debtor-in-possession financing or use of cash collateral.

The First Priority Secured Parties will acknowledge that the First Lien Obligations of any Series may, subject to
the limitations set forth in the other documents governing the First Lien Obligations, be increased, extended,
renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or
modified from time to time, all without affecting the priority of claims and application of proceeds set forth in the
First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the First Priority
Secured Parties of any Series.

By its acceptance of notes, each Holder will be deemed to have consented to the terms of the Security
Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and to have authorized and directed the Trustee and the Notes
Collateral Agent to execute, deliver and perform each of the Security Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement, to which it is a party, binding the Holders to the terms thereof.

The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will contain broad exculpatory provisions in favor of the Applicable
Collateral Agent and Applicable Authorized Representative. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will contain
provisions for the protection of the Applicable Collateral Agent and Applicable Authorized Representative from the
incurrence of certain liabilities and will contain provisions for satisfactory indemnity and/or security for such
liabilities (in the absence of which the Applicable Collateral Agent and Applicable Authorized Representative may
be entitled to decline to take any action).


-----

**_First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement_**

_General_

The Notes Collateral Agent, the Trustee, the First Lien Credit Facilities Administrative Agent and the Second
Lien Credit Facilities Administrative Agent will enter into an intercreditor agreement (as the same may be amended
from time to time, the “First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement”). The First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor
Agreement may be amended from time to time without the consent of the Holders to add other parties holding
Second Lien Obligations and First Lien Obligations permitted to be incurred under the relevant agreements, or their
respective representatives.

Notwithstanding (i) the date, time, method, manner, or order of grant, attachment, or perfection of, or any defect
or deficiencies in, or failure to perfect, any Liens granted to any First Lien Representative or any of the First Lien
Secured Parties in respect of all or any portion of the Collateral or of any Liens granted to any Second Lien
Representative or any of the Second Lien Secured Parties in respect of all or any portion of the Collateral and
regardless of how any such Lien was acquired (whether by grant, statute, operation of law, subrogation or otherwise)
and whether or not such Liens are otherwise subordinated, voided, avoided, invalidated or lapsed, (ii) the order or
time of filing or recordation of any document or instrument for perfecting the Liens in favor of any First Lien
Representative or any Second Lien Representative in any Collateral, (iii) any provision of the Uniform Commercial
Code, the Bankruptcy Code, other Debtor Relief Law, or any other applicable law, or of the First Lien Documents or
the Second Lien Documents, (iv) whether any First Lien Representative or any Second Lien Representative in each
case, either directly or through agents, holds possession of, or has control over, all or any part of the Collateral, (v)
the date on which any of the First Lien Obligations or the Second Lien Obligations are advanced or made available
to any Grantor, or (vi) any failure of any First Lien Representative or any Second Lien Representative to perfect its
Lien on any Collateral, the subordination of any Lien on the Collateral securing any First Lien Obligations or
Second Lien Obligations, as applicable, to any Lien securing any other obligation of any Grantor, or the avoidance,
invalidation or lapse of any Lien on the Collateral securing any First Lien Obligations or Second Lien Obligations:

(i) any Lien in respect of all or any portion of the Collateral now or hereafter held by or on behalf of any
Second Lien Representative or any other Second Lien Secured Party that secures all or any portion of the
Second Lien Obligations are junior and subordinate to all Liens granted to any First Lien Representative
and the other First Lien Secured Parties in the Collateral to secure all or any portion of (A) the First Lien
Priority Obligations and (B) the First Lien Obligations which do not constitute First Lien Priority
Obligations, in the case of this clause (B), solely after the Discharge of Second Lien Obligations;

(ii) any Lien in respect of all or any portion of the Collateral now or hereafter held by any First Lien
Representative or any other First Lien Secured Party that secures all or any portion of (A) the First Lien
Priority Obligations shall in all respects be senior and prior to all Liens granted to any Second Lien
Representative or any other Second Lien Secured Party in the Collateral to secure all or any portion of
the Second Lien Obligations, respectively, or (B) the First Lien Obligations which do not constitute First
Lien Priority Obligations shall in all respects be senior and prior to all Liens granted to any Second Lien
Representative or any other Second Lien Secured Party in the Collateral to secure all or any portion of
the Second Lien Obligations which do not constitute Second Lien Priority Obligations; and

(iii) any Lien in respect of all or any portion of the Collateral now or hereafter held by or on behalf of any
Second Lien Representative or any other Second Lien Secured Party that secures all or any portion of the
Second Lien Priority Obligations shall in all respects be senior and prior to all Liens granted to any First
Lien Representative or any other First Lien Secured Party in any Collateral to secure all or any portion of
the First Lien Obligations which do not constitute First Lien Priority Obligations.

Pursuant to the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, each Representative, acting on
behalf of the applicable Secured Parties, waives any right to take any action to contest or challenge (or assist or
support any other Person in contesting or challenging), directly or indirectly, whether or not in any proceeding, the
validity, priority, enforceability, or perfection of the Liens of, or the allowability of the claims asserted by, any other
Representative and the other Secured Parties in respect of the Collateral (in each case to the extent in accordance
with the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement) or the provisions of the First Lien/Second Lien
Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, each Second Lien Representative, acting on behalf of the applicable Second


-----

Lien Secured Parties (i) agrees not to take any action that would interfere with any exercise of remedies undertaken
by any of the First Lien Representatives or any First Lien Secured Party under the First Lien Documents with
respect to the Collateral and (ii) waives any and all rights it or the Second Lien Secured Parties may have as a junior
lien creditor or otherwise to contest, protest, object to, or interfere with the manner in which any First Lien
Representative or any First Lien Secured Party seeks to enforce its Liens in any Collateral.

The Collateral or proceeds thereof received in connection with the sale or other disposition of, or collection on,
such Collateral upon the exercise of remedies or in connection with an insolvency proceeding will be applied to the
First Lien Obligations prior to application to any Second Lien Obligations in such order as specified in the relevant
First Lien Security Documents until the Discharge of First Lien Obligations has occurred.

If any Representative or any other Secured Party is required in any insolvency proceeding or otherwise to turn
over or otherwise pay to the estate of any Grantor, or any other Person any payment made in satisfaction of all or
any portion of the Secured Obligations (a “Recovery”), then the applicable First Lien Obligations or Second Lien
Obligations shall be reinstated to the extent of such Recovery. If the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement
shall have been terminated prior to such Recovery, the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall be
reinstated in full force and effect in the event of such Recovery, and such prior termination shall not diminish,
release, discharge, impair, or otherwise affect the obligations of the Parties from such date of reinstatement. All
rights, interests, agreements, and obligations of the Representatives, and the Secured Parties under the First
Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall continue irrespective of the
commencement of, or any discharge, confirmation, conversion, or dismissal of, any insolvency proceeding by or
against any Grantor or any other circumstance which otherwise might constitute a defense available to, or a
discharge of any Grantor in respect of the Obligations. No priority or right of any Representative or any other
Secured Party shall at any time be prejudiced or impaired in any way by any act or failure to act on the part of any
Grantor or by the noncompliance by any Person with the terms, provisions, or covenants of any of the First Lien
Documents or Second Lien Documents, regardless of any knowledge thereof which any Representative or any
Secured Party may have.

The First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that so long as the Discharge of First Lien
Obligations has not occurred, no Second Lien Representative or any other Second Lien Secured Party will exercise
any remedies with respect to any of the Collateral; provided, however, that the Designated Second Lien
Representative or any person authorized by it may exercise remedies with respect to the Collateral after a period of
at least 150 days has elapsed since the date on which the Designated First Lien Representative has received written
notice from such Second Lien Representative of the existence of any event of default under any applicable Second
Lien Documents that is continuing and the written demand by such Second Lien Representative of the immediate
payment in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) of all of the Second Lien Obligations so
long as such event of default has not been cured or waived (such period being referred to herein as the “Standstill
Period”); provided further, however, that:

(i) in the event that at any time after a Second Lien Representative has sent a notice to the Designated First
Lien Representative to commence the Standstill Period, the event of default that was the basis for such
notice is cured or waived or otherwise ceases to exist, and any notice of acceleration has been rescinded
by such Second Lien Representative, then the notice to commence the Standstill Period shall
automatically and without further action of the parties be deemed rescinded and no Standstill Period
shall be deemed to have been commenced;

(ii) the Standstill Period shall be tolled for any period during which the Designated First Lien Representative
is stayed pursuant to any insolvency proceeding or by an order issued in any insolvency proceeding or
by any other court of competent jurisdiction from exercising any rights or remedies; and

(iii) in no event shall any Second Lien Representative or any other Second Lien Secured Parties or exercise
any remedies with respect to the Collateral or commence or petition for any action or proceeding with
respect to such rights or remedies if, notwithstanding the expiration of the Standstill Period, the
Designated First Lien Representative shall have (A) commenced and be diligently pursuing (or shall
have sought or requested relief from or modification of the automatic stay in any insolvency proceeding
to enable the commencement and pursuit thereof) the exercise of its rights or remedies against the
Grantors or all or any material portion of the Collateral, including any of the following: solicitation of


-----

bids from third parties to conduct the liquidation of all or any material portion of the Collateral, the
engagement or retention of sales brokers, marketing agents, investment bankers, accountants,
auctioneers or other third parties for the purpose of valuing, marketing, promoting or selling all or any
material portion of the Collateral, the notification of account debtors to make payments to a First Lien
Representative or its agents, the initiation of any action to take possession of all or any material portion
of the Collateral or the commencement of any legal proceedings or actions against or with respect to all
or any material portion of the Collateral and (B) given prompt notice of such exercise to the Designated
Second Lien Administrative Agent.

From and after the date that is the earlier of (x) the date upon which the Discharge of First Lien Obligations
shall have occurred and (y) the date the Standstill Period shall have expired, the Designated Second Lien
Representative or any Person authorized by it may exercise remedies with respect to any Collateral.

The foregoing will not prevent any Second Lien Representative or any Second Lien Secured Party from (i)
filing a claim or statement of interest with respect to the Second Lien Obligations owed to it in any insolvency
proceeding commenced by or against any Grantor, (ii) taking any action (not adverse to the priority or perfection
status of the Liens of any First Lien Representative or other First Lien Secured Parties on the Collateral or the rights
of any First Lien Representative or any of the other First Lien Secured Parties to exercise remedies in respect
thereof) in order to create, perfect, preserve or protect (but not enforce) its Lien on any Collateral and including
joining in (but not initiating or controlling) any foreclosure, sale or other judicial lien enforcement proceeding with
respect to the Collateral initiated by such First Lien Representative or other First Lien Secured Party, (iii) filing any
responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading filed
by any Person objecting to or otherwise seeking disallowance of the claim or Lien of such Second Lien
Representative or Second Lien Secured Party or otherwise making any agreements or filing any motions pertaining
to the Second Lien Obligations owing to it, in each case, to the extent not in contravention of the terms of the First
Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) bidding for and purchasing Collateral at any private or judicial
foreclosure sale of such Collateral initiated by any Agent (so long as such bid is subject to the limitations on credit
bidding set forth in the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement), (v) subject to the First Lien/Second Lien
Intercreditor Agreement, voting on any plan of reorganization or similar arrangement, filing any proof of claim or
proof of interest, making other filings and making any arguments and motions in any insolvency proceeding of any
Grantor that are, in each case, consistent with the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement with
respect to the Second Lien Obligations and the Collateral, (vi) subject to the requirements of the First Lien/Second
Lien Intercreditor Agreement, exercise remedies on and after the last day of the Standstill Period or (vii) asserting or
exercising all other rights and remedies as unsecured creditors (or filing any pleadings, objections, motions or
agreements which assert, or seek to exercise, such rights and remedies) to the extent set forth in the First
Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, in each case to the extent not inconsistent with or otherwise in violation
of the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

In the event of the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of the Collateral permitted under the
terms of the First Lien Documents and the Second Lien Documents, and in the event of any private or public sale of
all or any portion of the Collateral in connection with any exercise of remedies by any First Lien Representative, and
including for this purpose, any sale, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of the Collateral by a Grantor
with the consent of the Designated First Lien Representative at any time that an event of default under any First Lien
Debt Agreement has occurred and is continuing, such sale will be free and clear of the Liens on such Collateral
securing the Second Lien Obligations, and, upon consummation of such sale, transfer or other Disposition, the Liens
of each Second Lien Representative and the other Second Lien Secured Parties with respect to the Collateral so sold,
transferred, Disposed or released shall terminate and be automatically released without further action concurrently
with, and to the same extent as, the release of the First Lien Secured Parties’ Liens on such Collateral; provided,
_however, that the Liens of the parties shall attach to the proceeds of any such disposition of the Collateral with the_
same relative priority as the Liens which attached to the Collateral so released.

The First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that First Lien Representatives may enforce
the provisions of the applicable First Lien Documents and the Second Lien Representative may enforce the
provisions of the applicable Second Lien Documents, each may exercise any secured creditor remedies, all in such
order and in such manner as each may determine in the exercise of its sole discretion, to the extent such enforcement
and/or exercise of secured creditor remedies is consistent with the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor


-----

Agreement and mandatory provisions of applicable law; provided, however, that each of the Representatives agrees
to provide to each other Representative (x) a notice (an “Enforcement Notice”) prior to the commencement of the
exercise of secured creditor remedies and (y) copies of any notices that it is required, under applicable law or the
First Lien Documents or Second Lien Documents, as applicable, to deliver to any Grantor; provided further,
however, that no First Lien Representative’s failure to provide any such copies to the Second Lien Representative
(but not the Enforcement Notice) shall impair any First Lien Representative’s rights under the First Lien/Second
Lien Intercreditor Agreement or under any of the First Lien Documents and no Second Lien Representative’s failure
to provide any such copies to the First Lien Representative (but not the Enforcement Notice) shall impair any
Second Lien Representative’s rights under the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement or under any of
Second Lien Documents. Each Representative and each Secured Party shall agree that, except as otherwise set forth
in the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, it will not institute any suit or other proceeding or assert in
any suit, insolvency proceeding or other proceeding any claim, in the case of any Second Lien Representative and
each other Second Lien Secured Party, against the First Lien Representative, any other First Lien Secured Party, and
in the case of the First Lien Representative and each other First Lien Secured Party, against any Second Lien
Representative or any other Second Lien Secured Party, seeking damages or other relief by way of specific
performance, instructions or otherwise, with respect to, any action taken or omitted to be taken by such Person with
respect to the Collateral which is consistent and compliant with the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor
Agreement, and none of such parties shall be liable under the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement for
any such action taken or omitted to be taken.

**_Certain Matters in Connection with Liquidation and Insolvency Proceedings_**

The parties to the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement will agree that it constitutes a subordination
agreement for purposes of Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of any other Debtor
Relief Laws and shall be enforceable in any insolvency proceeding in accordance with its terms.

_Debtor in Possession Financings_

Each Second Lien Representative and each other Second Lien Secured Party will agree, among other things,
that if the Issuer or any Guarantor is subject to any insolvency proceeding, each Second Lien Secured Party will (x)
raise no objection to, nor support any other Person objecting to, and will be deemed to have consented to, the use of
any Collateral constituting cash collateral under Section 363(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, or any comparable
provision of any other Debtor Relief Laws (“Cash Collateral”), and/or any post-petition financing to be secured at
least in part by the Collateral under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of any other
Debtor Relief Laws (which may include a “roll-up” or “roll-over” of all or any of the First Lien Obligations),
whether provided by any First Lien Secured Party or other Person, but in each case to the extent approved for such
purpose by a First Lien Representative (a “DIP Financing”), (y) will not request or accept adequate protection or any
other relief in connection with the use of such Cash Collateral or such DIP Financing except as set forth in the First
Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, and (z) will subordinate (and will be deemed hereunder to have
subordinated) the Liens of the Second Lien Representatives or any other Second Lien Secured Parties on the
Collateral to (I) the Liens on the Collateral securing such DIP Financing (to the extent the Liens securing the DIP
Financing are pari passu or senior in priority to the Liens securing the First Lien Obligations), (II) any adequate
protection provided to the First Lien Secured Parties with respect to the Collateral and (III) any surcharge,
professional fee and U.S. trustee or clerk of the court fee “carve-outs” from the Collateral, in each case, consented to
by such First Lien Representative to be paid prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations (it being understood
that no such carve-out amounts shall be construed as giving rise to indebtedness under any DIP Financing for
purposes of the First Lien Cap or otherwise), in each case, on the same terms as the Liens of the Second Lien
Secured Parties are subordinated to the Liens granted with respect to such DIP Financing (and such subordination
will not alter in any manner the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement); provided that:

(1) without the consent of the Designated Second Lien Representative, the aggregate principal amount of the
DIP Financing plus the aggregate outstanding principal amount under the First Lien Documents
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any obligations under First Lien Secured Swap Agreements) not
refinanced with, or “rolled up” into, the DIP Financing, plus the aggregate face amount of any letters of
credit, banker’s acceptances, bank guarantees or similar instruments issued (and whether drawn or
undrawn) and not reimbursed (or cash collateralized) under the First Lien Documents (excluding, for the


-----

avoidance of doubt, any First Lien Secured Cash Management Obligations or any First Lien Secured
Swap Obligations), will not exceed 115% of the First Lien Cap;

(2) the DIP Financing does not compel any Grantor to seek confirmation of a specific plan of reorganization
or similar arrangement for which all or substantially all of the material terms are set forth in the DIP
Financing documentation or a related document;

(3) the foregoing shall not prevent any of the Second Lien Secured Parties from (a) objecting to any
provision in any DIP Financing relating to any provision or content of a plan of reorganization or similar
arrangement to the extent that such objection is not inconsistent with the terms of the First Lien/Second
Lien Intercreditor Agreement, or (b) objecting to any agreement or arrangements that require a specific
treatment of the claim in the insolvency proceeding for purposes of a plan of reorganization or similar
arrangement, or that contravene the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor in any material
respect (provided that in no event shall the foregoing be construed to give rise to the right to object to
any of the rights and remedies that are customary for First Lien Representative to receive as part of any
order with respect to the use of Cash Collateral or any such DIP Financing);

(4) the Second Lien Secured Parties receive a replacement Lien on post-petition assets, with the same
priority relative to the Liens thereon securing the First Lien Obligations as existed prior to the
commencement of the insolvency proceeding to the extent the Second Lien Secured Parties seek such
replacement Liens and such replacement Liens are granted by the bankruptcy court having jurisdiction
over the case, it being agreed that First Lien Secured Parties will raise no objection to or oppose a
motion of (or support any Person in objecting or opposing) the Second Lien Secured Parties seeking
such replacement Lien; and

(5) the DIP Financing documentation or Cash Collateral order does not expressly require the liquidation of
the Collateral prior to a default under the DIP Financing documentation or Cash Collateral order (other
than any sale or disposition of any assets of any Grantor pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code
that is supported by the First Lien Secured Parties).

_Relief from Automatic Stay; Bankruptcy Sales; and Post-Petition Interest_

No Second Lien Secured Party may (1) seek relief from the automatic stay under Section 362 of the Bankruptcy
Code or any other stay in any insolvency proceeding in respect of any portion of the Collateral without each First
Lien Representative’s express written consent; provided that in the event that any or all of the First Lien
Representatives and the other applicable Secured Parties are seeking or have obtained relief from the automatic stay
with respect to any Collateral, any Second Lien Representative may join such First Lien Representative in seeking
corresponding relief from the automatic stay with respect to such Collateral and, upon obtaining such relief, may
join such First Lien Representative in any foreclosure or other enforcement action commenced by any of the
Secured Parties against any Collateral, but shall not take any independent action to commence or pursue any
foreclosure or other enforcement action against any Collateral until after the Discharge of First Lien Obligations or
after the expiration of the Standstill Period in accordance with the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement;
any actions of a Second Lien Representative being subject to such Second Lien Representative’s agreement not to
hinder, delay or interfere with the efforts by a First Lien Representative and/or the other applicable Secured Parties
either to obtain relief from the automatic stay with respect to such Collateral or to exercise any rights or remedies
against such Collateral, (2) object or oppose (or support any Person in objecting or opposing), and will be deemed to
have consented to pursuant to Section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, (i) a motion to sell or otherwise dispose of
any Collateral under Sections 363, 365 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provisions under any other
applicable Debtor Relief Laws, free and clear of any Liens or other claims, (ii) a motion establishing notice, sale or
bidding procedures for such disposition (including any break-up fee or other bidder protections) or (iii) a motion to
permit a credit bid of all or any portion of the claims of the Secured Parties under Section 363(k), in each case, if a
First Lien Representative has consented to such sale or disposition of such Collateral, subject certain requirements in
the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement or (iv) the right of the First Lien Secured Parties to credit bid
under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision under any other applicable Debtor Relief
Laws) with respect to the Collateral, subject to certain requirements in the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor
Agreement, or (3) contest (or support any other Person contesting) (x) any request by any First Lien Representative
or any First Lien Secured Party for adequate protection of its interest in the Collateral to the extent in compliance


-----

with the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (y) any objection by any First Lien
Representative or any First Lien Secured Party to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on a claim by such
First Lien Representative or First Lien Secured Party that its interests in the Collateral are not adequately protected
(or any other similar request under any law applicable to an insolvency proceeding), to the extent not inconsistent
with the other terms of this Agreement and so long as any Liens granted to such First Lien Representative as
adequate protection of its interests are subject to the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement or (z) the
payment of interest, fees, expenses or other amounts to any First Lien Representative or any First Lien Secured
Party under Section 506(b) or 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise from the proceeds of Collateral.

_Adequate Protection_

Each Second Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Second Lien Secured Party, will
agree that none of them shall contest (or support any other Person contesting) (x) any request by any First Lien
Representative or any First Lien Secured Party for adequate protection of its interest in the Collateral to the extent in
compliance with the terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (y) any objection by any First
Lien Representative or any First Lien Secured Party to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on a claim by
such First Lien Representative or First Lien Secured Party that its interests in the Collateral are not adequately
protected (or any other similar request under any law applicable to an insolvency proceeding), to the extent not
inconsistent with the other terms of the First Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement and so long as any Liens
granted to such First Lien Representative as adequate protection of its interests are subject to the First Lien/Second
Lien Intercreditor Agreement or (z) the payment of interest, fees, expenses or other amounts to any First Lien
Representative or any First Lien Secured Party under Section 506(b) or 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise
from the Proceeds of Collateral. Each Second Lien Representative, on behalf of itself and the other applicable
Second Lien Secured Parties, further agrees that, prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, none of them shall
assert or enforce any claim against any Collateral under Section 506(b) or 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or
otherwise that is senior to or on a parity with the Liens created pursuant to the First Lien Documents or Second Lien
Documents with respect to such Collateral for costs or expenses of preserving or disposing of any Collateral. In an
insolvency proceeding (i) if a Second Lien Representative, on behalf of itself or any other Second Lien Secured
Parties, seeks or requests adequate protection in respect of Second Lien Obligations and such adequate protection is
granted in the form of additional collateral of a type of asset or property that would constitute Collateral, then such
Second Lien Representative, on behalf of itself and the other applicable Second Lien Secured Parties, agrees that
each First Lien Representative shall also be granted a Lien on such additional collateral as security and adequate
protection for the First Lien Obligations and for any use of Collateral or DIP Financing and that any Lien on such
additional collateral securing or providing adequate protection for the applicable Second Lien Obligations shall be
subordinated to the Lien on such collateral securing the First Lien Obligations and any such use of Collateral or DIP
Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) and to any other Liens granted to the First Lien Secured Parties as
adequate protection on the same basis as the other Liens on Collateral securing the Second Lien Obligations are so
subordinated to the Liens on Collateral securing the First Lien Obligations under the First Lien/Second Lien
Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) any or all of the First Lien Representative and the First Lien Secured Parties (or,
after the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, any or all of the Second Lien Representative and the Second Lien
Secured Parties), as the case may be, may request and obtain administrative expense claims or superpriority
administrative expense claims as adequate protection, or pursuant to Section 507(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or
otherwise, and all such administrative expense claims or superpriority administrative expense claims granted to the
First Lien Representative and First Lien Secured Parties (or, after the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, the
Second Lien Representative and the Second Lien Secured Parties) shall be pari passu based on the aggregate
outstanding amounts of such administrative expense claims and superpriority administrative expense claims held by
the First Lien Representative (or, after the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, the Second Lien Representative) and
the First Lien Secured Parties (or, after the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, the Second Lien Secured Parties). In
addition, all administrative expense claims or superpriority administrative expense claims granted to any or all of the
First Lien Representatives (or, after the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, the Second Lien Representatives) and
the First Lien Secured Parties (or, after the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, the Second Lien Secured Parties)
with respect to any First Lien Obligations (or, after the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, the Second Lien
Obligations) shall be junior to any claims relating to any DIP Financing.


-----

_Plans of Reorganization_

Without the consent of the First Lien Secured Parties prior to the Discharge of First Lien Obligations, the
Second Lien Secured Parties will not propose, support or vote, directly or indirectly (including by any restructuring
plan support agreement) for any plan of reorganization or similar arrangement that is inconsistent with the First
Lien/Second Lien Intercreditor Agreement unless such plan of reorganization or similar arrangement is accepted by
the number of First Lien Secured Parties required under Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise
provides for the payment in full in cash of all First Lien Obligations (including all post-petition interest approved by
the bankruptcy court, fees and expenses and cash collateralization of all letters of credit) on the effective date of
such plan of reorganization or similar arrangement.

If it is held that the claims of the First Lien Secured Parties and the Second Lien Secured Parties in respect of
the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of senior and junior secured claims),
then the Second Lien Secured Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that all distributions shall be made as if there
were separate classes of First Lien Obligation claims and Second Lien Obligation claims against the Grantors, with
the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all
claims held by the Second Lien Secured Parties), the First Lien Secured Parties shall be entitled to receive, in
addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest, fees, expenses and all other
claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition interest, fees and expenses that are available from the Collateral
for the First Lien Secured Parties before any distribution is made in respect of the claims held by the Second Lien
Secured Parties from the Collateral, with the Second Lien Secured Parties hereby acknowledging and agreeing to
turn over to the First Lien Secured Parties amounts otherwise received or receivable by them from the Collateral to
the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the
aggregate recoveries.

If, in any insolvency proceeding, debt obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor secured by Liens upon any
property of such reorganized Issuer or Guarantor are distributed, pursuant to a plan of reorganization or similar
arrangement on account of both the First Lien Obligations and the Second Lien Obligations, then, to the extent the
debt obligations distributed on account of the First Lien Obligations and on account of the Second Lien Obligations
are secured by Liens upon the same assets or property, the provisions of the Agreement will survive the distribution
of such debt obligations pursuant to such plan of reorganization or similar arrangement and will apply with like
effect to the Liens securing such debt obligations.

**_Release of Collateral_**

The property and other assets included in the Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes will be automatically
and unconditionally released under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) to enable the Issuers and/or Guarantors to consummate the disposition of property or assets to any
Person other than the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor to the extent not prohibited under the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales”;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee with respect to the Notes, the release of the
property and assets of such Guarantor;

(3) in the case of a sale or other transfer as part of or in connection with an Asset Sale by the Issuer, the CoIssuer or any Guarantor to a person other than the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor in a transaction
permitted under the terms of the Indenture;

(4) in respect of the property and assets of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor, upon the designation
of such Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or upon
such Restricted Subsidiary otherwise becoming an Excluded Subsidiary;

(5) in respect of the property and assets of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor that at any time is not
subject to a Lien securing the New First Lien Credit Facilities (including by becoming an Excluded
Asset (including Equity Interests of a Person that is sold or transferred));


-----

(6) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers” below;

(7) upon such property or other asset being released in respect of the Liens securing the New First Lien
Credit Facilities or any replacement Credit Facilities in respect thereof (excluding in the case of the
payment thereof);

(8) as required by the terms of any applicable Intercreditor Agreement;

(9 upon such property or asset becoming an Excluded Asset; or

(10) upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event.

The security interests in all Collateral securing the Notes also will be released upon (i) payment in full of the
principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes and all other Obligations under the Indenture,
the Guarantees under the Indenture and the Notes Security Documents that are due and payable at or prior to the
time such principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest, are paid (including pursuant to a satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture as described below under “—Satisfaction and Discharge”), (ii) a legal defeasance or
covenant defeasance under the Indenture as described below under “—Defeasance” or (iii) pursuant to the Security
Documents or the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement described above.

Notwithstanding clause (10) above, following the Reversion Date, the Issuers and the Guarantors shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary to provide to the Notes Collateral Agent for
its benefit and the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes valid and perfected security interests (subject
to Permitted Liens) in the Collateral within 120 days after such Reversion Date or as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter (but in each case, subject to all limitations and exclusions set forth herein).

The Issuers and the Guarantors may, subject to the provisions of the Indenture, among other things, without any
release or consent by the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent, the First Lien Representatives or the Second Lien
Collateral Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, including, without limitation:

  - selling or otherwise disposing of, in any transaction or series of related transactions, any property subject to
the Lien of the Notes Security Documents that has become worn out, defective, obsolete or not used or
useful in the business;

  - abandoning, terminating, canceling, releasing or making alterations in or substitutions of any leases or
contracts subject to the Lien of the Indenture or any of the Notes Security Documents;

  - surrendering or modifying any franchise, license or permit subject to the Lien of the Notes Security
Documents that it may own or under which it may be operating;

  - altering, repairing, replacing, changing the location or position of and adding to its structures, machinery,
systems, equipment, fixtures and appurtenances;

  - granting a license of any intellectual property;

  - selling, transferring or otherwise disposing of inventory in the ordinary course of business;

  - collecting accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business as permitted by the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales”;

  - making cash payments (including for the repayment of indebtedness or interest) from cash that is at any
time part of the Collateral in the ordinary course of business that are not otherwise prohibited by the
Indenture and the Notes Security Documents; and

  - abandoning any intellectual property that is no longer used or useful in Holdings’ business.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs after the Completion Date, unless the Issuers have
previously or concurrently sent a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “—
Optional Redemption,” the Issuers will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described
below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash (the “Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the
aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase,
subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the purchase date. Within 60 days following any Change of
Control, the Issuers will send (or cause to be sent) notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by firstclass mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the
security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC with the following information:

(1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Change of Control,” and
that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment
by the Issuers;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days
from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), except in the case of a
conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below;

(3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;

(4) that unless the Issuers default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for
payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control
Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be
required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the
reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC to the Paying
Agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the
third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes and such new Notes
will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered. The unpurchased
portion of the Notes must be equal to at least $2,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof
in relation to the Notes;

(7) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control and shall describe each such
condition, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the Change of Control Payment
Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is sent) as any or all
such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or that such repurchase may not occur and such notice may
be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the
Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed, or such
notice or offer may be rescinded at any time in the Issuers’ sole discretion if the Issuers determine that
any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived;

(8) any other instructions, as determined by the Issuers, consistent with this Change of Control covenant,
that a Holder must follow; and

(9) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuers to
purchase such Notes; provided that the applicable Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of
business on the tenth Business Day prior to the expiration date of the Change of Control Offer, a
facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder of the Notes, the principal amount of


-----

Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes, or a
specified portion thereof, and its election to have such Notes purchased.

While the Notes are in global form and the Issuers make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes or withdraw such
election through the facilities of DTC, subject to its applicable rules and regulations.

The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws
or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities
laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue
thereof.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law:

(1) accept for payment all Notes issued by them or portions thereof validly tendered pursuant to the Change
of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the applicable Paying Agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment
in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered and not validly withdrawn; and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted, together with an
Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and
purchased by the Issuers.

The New First Lien Credit Facilities will provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to
Indebtedness to which the Issuers (or one of their Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain change of
control events with respect to the Issuers would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under
the Indenture). If the Issuer or the Co-Issuer experiences a change of control event that triggers a default under the
New First Lien Credit Facilities, the New Second Lien Credit Facility or any such future Indebtedness, the Issuers
could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the New First Lien Credit Facilities, the New Second Lien
Credit Facility and/or such future Indebtedness. In the event the Issuers do not obtain such a waiver or do not
refinance the New First Lien Credit Facilities, the New Second Lien Credit Facility and/or such future Indebtedness,
such default or failure to repurchase any tendered Notes could result in amounts outstanding under the New First
Lien Credit Facilities, the New Second Lien Credit Facility and/or such future Indebtedness being declared due and
payable and/or cause Permitted Receivables Financings or other financing arrangements to be wound down.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited
by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make
any required repurchases.

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or
discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. We have no present intention
to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the
future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including
acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the
Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our
capital structure or credit ratings.

Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—
Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock” and, in the case of Secured Indebtedness, “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture
can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding
Notes. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants
or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.


-----

The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third
party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchases
all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) in connection with
or in contemplation of any Change of Control, the Issuers (or any Affiliate of the Issuers) have made an offer to
purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change
of Control Payment and has purchased all Notes properly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Alternate
Offer.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in
advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for
the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer.

A Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with
respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes and/or Guarantees (but the Change of
Control Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents).

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of “Change of Control,” may be waived or modified with
the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes.

**_Asset Sales_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
consummate an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including, but not
limited to, by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise, in connection with, such Asset Sale) at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal
to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Issuer at the time of contractually agreeing to
such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least (x) 50% of the consideration for such Asset Sale (a
“50% Cash Asset Sale”) or (y) 75% of the consideration for such Asset Sale (a “75% Cash Asset Sale”),
in each case, together with all other Asset Sales since the Completion Date (on a cumulative basis),
received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of Cash
Equivalents; provided that the amount of:

(a) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities (as reflected on the
Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes
thereto or, if incurred or increased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities
that would have been reflected on the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s consolidated
balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or increase had taken place on or prior
to the date of such balance sheet, as determined by the Issuer) of the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes, that are
(i) assumed by the transferee of any such assets (or a third party in connection with such transfer)
pursuant to a written agreement which releases or indemnifies the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such liabilities or (ii) otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the
transaction;

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted or reasonably expected by the Issuer acting in
good faith to be converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into Cash Equivalents (to
the extent of the Cash Equivalents received or expected to be received) or by their terms are
required to be satisfied for Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset
Sale; and


-----

(c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated
Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to
exceed the greater of (i) $811.0 million and (ii) 100.0% of LTM EBITDA at the time of the
receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration (or, at the Issuer’s option, at the time of
contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), with the fair market value of each item of Designated
Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value, shall be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for purposes of this
provision and for no other purpose.

Within 730 days after the later of (A) the date of any Asset Sale and (B) the receipt of any Net Proceeds of such
Asset Sale, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply an amount up to the Asset Sale
Prepayment Percentage of the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale,

(1) (a) to the extent such Net Proceeds are from an Asset Sale of Collateral, to reduce Indebtedness
(through a prepayment, repayment or purchase, as applicable) as follows:

(i) Obligations under the Notes;

(ii) First Lien Obligations and, in the case of revolving obligations (other than Obligations in
respect of any asset-based credit facility), to correspondingly reduce commitments with
respect thereto; or

(iii) Obligations of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor, other than
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(b) to the extent such Net Proceeds are from an Asset Sale that does not constitute Collateral, to
reduce Indebtedness (through a prepayment, repayment or purchase, as applicable) as follows:

(i) Obligations under a Credit Facility to the extent such Obligations were incurred under
clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” and,
in the case of revolving obligations (other than Obligations in respect of any asset-based
credit facility), to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto;

(ii) Obligations under Secured Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary), and, in the case of revolving obligations (other than Obligations in
respect of any asset-based credit facility), to correspondingly reduce commitments with
respect thereto;

(iii) Obligations under any Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (and,
in the case of Senior Indebtedness that consists of revolving obligations (other than
Obligations in respect of any asset-based credit facility), to correspondingly reduce any
outstanding commitments with respect thereto); provided that if the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary shall so reduce any Senior Indebtedness, the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary will either (A) reduce Obligations under the Notes on a pro rata
basis by, at its option, (x) redeeming Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption”
or (y) purchasing Notes through open-market purchases or in privately negotiated
transactions at market prices (which may be below par), or (B) make an offer (in
accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to
purchase their Notes on a ratable basis with such other Senior Indebtedness for no less
than 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest,
if any, thereon up to the principal amount of Notes to be repurchased;

(iv) Obligations of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor, other than
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, and, in the case of revolving


-----

obligations (other than Obligations in respect of any asset-based credit facility), to
correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; or

(v) to the extent such Net Proceeds are from an Asset Sale of property or assets of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is not the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor, Obligations of the Issuer, the CoIssuer or a Guarantor other than Subordinated Indebtedness and other than Indebtedness
owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, and, in the case of revolving obligations
(other than Obligations in respect of any asset-based credit facility), to correspondingly
reduce commitments with respect thereto; or

(2) solely in the case of a 75% Cash Asset Sale, to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses so
long as such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in
the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital
Stock of such business such that it constitutes or continues to constitute a Restricted Subsidiary, (b)
capital expenditures, Capitalized Software Expenditures or acquisitions of intellectual property or
intellectual property rights, (c) acquisitions of other properties or assets that, in each of (a), (b) and (c),
are used or useful in a Similar Business or replace the businesses, properties and/ or assets that are the
subject of such Asset Sale or (d) repayment of intercompany loans among the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries; provided that (I) the Issuer may elect to deem expenditures that otherwise would be
permissible Investments, capital expenditures or acquisitions of other property or assets or permissible
repayments within the scope of the foregoing clauses (a), (b), (c) or (d), as applicable, that occur prior to
the receipt of the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale to have been invested in accordance with this
clause (2) (it being agreed that such deemed expenditure shall have been made no earlier than the earliest
of (x) notice of such Asset Sale, (y) execution of a binding agreement for such Asset Sale, if applicable,
and (z) consummation of such Asset Sale) and (II) for the avoidance of doubt, during such reinvestment
period, notwithstanding any further prepayment obligations arising from this clause, the Issuer may, in
its sole discretion, utilize such Net Proceeds for general corporate purposes not otherwise prohibited by
the Indenture; or

(3) solely in the case of a 75% Cash Asset Sale, any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that a binding commitment or letter of intent entered into not later than such 730th day shall be treated as a_
permitted application of the Asset Sale Prepayment Percentage of such Net Proceeds from the date of such
commitment or letter of intent so long as the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment or
letter of intent with the good faith expectation that the Asset Sale Prepayment Percentage of such Net Proceeds will
be applied to satisfy such commitment or letter of intent within the later of such 730th day and 180 days of such
commitment or letter of intent (an “Acceptable Commitment”) or, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later
cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Asset Sale Prepayment Percentage of such Net Proceeds are
applied in connection therewith, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable
Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination; provided further that if
any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then
the Asset Sale Prepayment Percentage of such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that the application of any or all of the
Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale by the Issuer or a Foreign Subsidiary giving rise to a prepayment pursuant to this
covenant (or at any time during the applicable investment period described herein) (a “Foreign Disposition”) is (x)
prohibited or delayed by or would violate or conflict with applicable law from being repatriated to the United States
or (y) would conflict with the fiduciary duties of such Foreign Subsidiary’s directors, or result in, or could
reasonably be expected to result in, a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any Company Person of such
Foreign Subsidiary (including on account of financial assistance, corporate benefit, thin capitalization, capital
maintenance or similar considerations), then, in each such case, an amount equal to the portion of such Net Proceeds
so affected will not be required to be applied to reduce Indebtedness in compliance with this covenant, and such
amounts may be retained by the Issuer or the applicable Foreign Subsidiary, and if such repatriation of any of such
affected Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable law and, to the extent applicable, would no longer conflict
with the fiduciary duties of such Company Person or result in, or be reasonably expected to result in, a material risk
of personal or criminal liability for such Company Person, in either case, within 365 days following such Foreign
Disposition, the relevant Foreign Subsidiary will promptly repatriate the relevant Net Proceeds and such repatriated


-----

Net Proceeds will be promptly applied (net of additional taxes, costs or expenses that would be payable or reserved
against as a result thereof, in each case by the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Guarantor, any Subsidiary of the Issuer,
Co-Issuer or such Guarantor and any Affiliates or direct or indirect equity owners of the foregoing) in compliance
with this covenant, (ii) to the extent that and for so long as the Issuer has determined in good faith that repatriation
of any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Foreign Disposition would have an adverse accounting consequence or an
adverse tax or cost consequence (other than any consequence that would be immaterial to the amount being
repatriated) to Issuer or its Subsidiaries or any Parent Entities, Affiliates or direct or indirect equity owners thereof
(taking into account any foreign tax credit or benefit actually realized in connection with such repatriation in the
year of such repatriation), including any withholding tax, with respect to such Net Proceeds if such amount were
repatriated as a dividend, the Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied to reduce Indebtedness in
compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary; provided
that if the Issuer determines in good faith, within 365 days of such Foreign Disposition, that the repatriation of any
or all the Net Proceeds of such Foreign Disposition would no longer have such an adverse accounting consequence
or an adverse Tax or cost consequence (other than any consequence that would be immaterial to the amount being
repatriated) to Issuer or its Subsidiaries or any Parent Entities, Affiliates or direct or indirect equity owners thereof
(taking into account any foreign tax credit or benefit actually realized in connection with such repatriation in the
year of such repatriation), including any withholding tax, with respect to such Net Proceeds if such amount were
repatriated as a dividend, the relevant Foreign Subsidiary will promptly repatriate the relevant Net Proceeds and
such repatriated Net Proceeds shall be promptly applied (net of additional taxes, costs or expenses that would be
payable or reserved against as a result thereof, in each case by the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Guarantor, any
Subsidiary of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or such Guarantor and any Affiliates or direct or indirect equity owners of the
foregoing) in compliance with this covenant and (iii) in connection with any prepayment attributable to any Joint
Venture, to the extent that repatriation of any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Foreign Disposition of a Foreign
Subsidiary giving rise to a prepayment pursuant to this covenant (or at any time during the applicable investment
period described herein), violate any applicable organizational documents or any agreement of any Joint Venture (or
any relevant shareholders’ agreement or similar agreement), in each case if the amount subject to the relevant
prepayment were upstreamed or transferred as a distribution or dividend, the portion of such Net Proceeds so
affected will not be required to be applied to reduce Indebtedness and such amounts may be retained by the
applicable Foreign Subsidiary; provided that if repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds is permitted under
the applicable documents within 365 days of such Foreign Disposition, the relevant Foreign Subsidiary will
promptly repatriate the relevant Net Proceeds and such repatriated Net Proceeds will be promptly applied (net of
additional taxes, costs or expenses that would be payable or reserved against as a result thereof, in each case by the
Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Guarantor, any Subsidiary of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or such Guarantor and any
Affiliates or direct or indirect equity owners of the foregoing) in compliance with this covenant. Any of the
foregoing prohibitions, violations, legal liability events, fiduciary duty or similar considerations, capitalization
requirements and/or tax costs or consequences, are referred to collectively as “Payment Deferral Events”. The nonapplication of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of any of the foregoing Payment Deferral Events will not,
for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the
Indenture shall be construed to require either Issuer or any Subsidiary to repatriate cash.

Any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale of Collateral (other than Retained Asset Sale Proceeds and any amounts
excluded from this covenant as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph) that are not invested or applied as
provided and within the time period set forth in the second preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute
“Excess Proceeds”; provided that any amount of Net Proceeds offered to Holders of the Notes pursuant to clause
(1)(b)(iii) of the second preceding paragraph shall not be deemed to be Excess Proceeds without regard to whether
such offer is accepted by any Holders. When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds (i) with respect to
any single transaction or series of related transactions, the greater of (x) $81.1 million and (y) 10.0% of LTM
EBITDA individually or (ii) with respect to all other such dispositions, the greater of (x) $283.9 million and (y)
35.0% of LTM EBITDA in the aggregate in any fiscal year (the “Excess Proceeds Threshold”), the Issuers shall
make an offer (a “Asset Sale Offer”) to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any
other First Lien Obligations or Obligations secured by a Lien permitted under the Indenture on the Collateral
disposed of (which Lien is not subordinate to the Lien of the Notes with respect to the Collateral), to the holders of
such other First Lien Obligations or other Obligations, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or
accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such other First Lien Obligations or other Obligations that is, with
respect to the Notes only, in an amount equal to $2,000, or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that may
be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to


-----

100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value thereof, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to
the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, and in the
case of such other First Lien Obligations or other Obligations, at the offer price required by the terms thereof, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the agreement(s) governing such other First Lien Obligations or other
Obligations. The Issuers will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within 20 Business
Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed the Excess Proceeds Threshold by delivering to the Holders the
notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuers may satisfy the
foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with
respect to such Net Proceeds prior to the time period that may be required by the Indenture with respect to all or a
part of the available Net Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture
(an “Advance Offer”).

To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and such other First Lien
Obligations or Obligations secured by a Lien permitted under the Indenture on the Collateral disposed of, as the case
may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the amount offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the
case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuers may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case
of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) (“Declined Proceeds”) for any purposes not otherwise prohibited under
the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and such other First Lien
Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount
offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuers shall purchase
the Notes (subject to applicable DTC procedures as to global notes) and such other First Lien Obligations or other
Obligations, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if
applicable) of the Notes and such other First Lien Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, tendered
with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or such other First Lien Obligations or other Obligations, as the case
may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer
(or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) that
resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Sale Offer shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any
remaining Excess Proceeds (or Advance Portion) upon such completion). Upon consummation or expiration of any
Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), any remaining Net Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the
Issuers may use such Net Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture.

An Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to
an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes, Notes Security Documents and/or Guarantees (but the
Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents).

Pending the final application of the amount of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness, or otherwise use such Net Proceeds in any manner not
prohibited by the Indenture.

The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of the Notes pursuant to a Collateral Asset Sale Offer, an Asset Sale Offer, a Collateral Advance Offer or
an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions
of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed
to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes.

The New First Lien Credit Facilities and the New Second Lien Credit Facility contain, and future credit
agreements or other similar agreements to which the Issuers become a party may contain, restrictions on the Issuers’
ability to repurchase Notes. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuers are prohibited from
purchasing Notes, the Issuers could seek the consent of their lenders to the repurchase of the Notes or could attempt
to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuers do not obtain such consent or repay such
borrowings, the Issuers will remain prohibited from repurchasing the Notes. In such a case, the Issuers’ failure to


-----

repurchase tendered Notes would constitute a Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a
default under such other agreements.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture that will apply to the Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries.

If on any date following the Completion Date, (i) the Notes have an Investment Grade Rating from any of the
Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events
described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event” and
the date thereof being referred to as the “Suspension Date”), then the covenants specifically listed under the
following captions in this “Description of Notes” section of this offering memorandum will no longer be applicable
to such Notes (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”) until the occurrence of the Reversion Date (as defined
below):

(1) “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”;

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”;

(4) clause (3) of the first paragraph and the entire fifth and sixth paragraphs of “—Merger, Consolidation or
Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”;

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”; and

(7) “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries.”

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Issuer may not designate any of its
Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

If and while the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the Notes
will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing,
and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) each of the Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade
Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating (in each case, to the extent
given an Investment Grade Rating by such Rating Agency), then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will
thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events. The period
of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this “Description of Notes” as the
“Suspension Period.” The Guarantees of the Subsidiary Guarantors will be suspended during the Suspension Period.
Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Collateral Excess Proceeds and
Excess Proceeds from any Asset Sales shall be reset to zero.

During the Suspension Period, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens to the
extent provided for under “—Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens) to the extent provided for in
such covenant and any Permitted Liens which may refer to one or more Suspended Covenants shall be interpreted as
though such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely
for purposes of the “—Liens” covenant and the “Permitted Liens” definition and for no other covenant).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by
the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or Event of
Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes, and no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to exist or
have occurred as a result of any failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply with any of the
Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period; provided that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments made
after such reinstatement, the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments will be calculated as though the


-----

covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not
during, the Suspension Period (including with respect to a Limited Condition Transaction entered into during the
Suspension Period); (2) all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the
Suspension Period (or deemed incurred or issued in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction entered into
during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3) of the second
paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”;
(3) any Affiliate Transaction entered into after such reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into during any
Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Transactions with Affiliates”; (4) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary that is not the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (1) through (3) of the first
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to
clause (a) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions
Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”; (5) no Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be required to comply with the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” after such reinstatement
with respect to any guarantee or obligation entered into by such Subsidiary during any Suspension Period; and
(6) all Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed made in connection with a Limited Condition
Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been made under clause (5) of the
definition of “Permitted Investments.”

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no Default,
Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees with
respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any
actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any
contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with the
Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time
based solely on any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension Period), and (2) following a Reversion
Date, the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to
honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension
Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating. The Issuers
will give the Trustee written notice upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event or upon the occurrence of
a Reversion Date. The Trustee shall have no duty to (i) monitor the ratings of the Notes, (ii) ascertain whether a
Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date have occurred, or (iii) notify the Holders of any of the foregoing.

**_Limited Condition Transactions_**

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary (including in connection with any calculation made
on a pro forma basis), to the extent that the terms of the Indenture require (i) compliance with any financial ratio or
test (including, any financial ratio test and/or any cap expressed as a percentage of Consolidated Total Assets,
Consolidated Net Income or LTM EBITDA), (ii) accuracy of any representations or warranties and/or require the
absence of a Default or Event of Default (or any type of Default or Event of Default) or (iii) compliance with any
other availability of a “basket”, condition or exception set forth in the Indenture, in each case, in connection with a
Limited Condition Transaction, the determination of whether the relevant condition is satisfied, in each case at the
election of the Issuer (the Issuer’s election to exercise such option in connection with any Limited Condition
Transaction, an “LCT Election”) may be made, (1) in the case of any acquisition, consolidation, business
combination or other Investment, any Change of Control, any incurrence or assumption of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of Liens, repayments,
Restricted Payments and Asset Sales or any transaction related to the foregoing, at the time of (or on the basis of the
financial statements for the most recently ended measurement period at the time of) either (a) the execution of the
definitive acquisition agreements or other binding contracts or agreements, or the establishment of a commitment, as
applicable, with respect to such acquisition, consolidation, business combination, Change of Control or other
Investment, Asset Sale, Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock or related transaction (or, solely in
connection with an acquisition, consolidation or business combination to which the United Kingdom City Code on
Takeovers and Mergers applies, the date on which a “Rule 2.7 Announcement” of a firm intention to make an offer


-----

is made or similar announcement or determination in another jurisdiction subject to laws similar to the City Code in
respect of such target company made in compliance with the City Code or similar laws or practices in other
jurisdictions (a “Public Offer”)) or the establishment of a commitment with respect to such Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock or (b) the consummation of such acquisition, consolidation, business
combination, Change of Control or other Investment, incurrence or assumption of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and
Asset Sales or related transaction, (2) in the case of any Restricted Payment, at the time of (or on the basis of the
financial statements for the most recently ended measurement period at the time of) (x) the declaration of such
Restricted Payment or (y) the making of such Restricted Payment and (3) in the case of any Restricted Payment in
respect of Subordinated Indebtedness, at the time of (or on the basis of the financial statements for the most recently
ended measurement period at the time of) (x) delivery of irrevocable (which may be conditional) notice with respect
to such Restricted Payment or (y) the making of such Restricted Payment (the applicable date pursuant to clause (1),
(2) or (3) above, as applicable, the “LCT Test Date”), and, in each case, if, after giving pro forma effect to the
relevant Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions,
Investments, the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the use of
proceeds thereof, the incurrence of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Sales) and any related pro
forma adjustments (disregarding for the purposes of such pro forma calculation any borrowing under the revolving
credit facility that is part of the New First Lien Credit Facilities and/or any other revolving facility) and, at the
election of the Issuer, any other acquisition, consolidation, business combination or similar Investment, Restricted
Payment, incurrence or assumption of Indebtedness, Asset Sale or other transaction that has not been consummated
but with respect to which the Issuers have elected to test any applicable condition prior to the date of consummation
in accordance with this paragraph, as if they had occurred at the beginning of the most recently completed four fiscal
quarter measurement period ending prior to the LCT Test Date, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries could
have taken such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratios, representation, warranty,
absence of Default or Event of Default or “basket”, such ratio, representation, warranty, absence of Default or Event
of Default or “basket” shall be deemed to have been complied with (and no Default or Event of Default shall be
deemed to have occurred solely as a result of an adverse change in such ratio, test, amount or condition occurring
after the time such election is made (but any subsequent improvement in the applicable ratio, test or amount may be
utilized by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary)).

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuer has made an LCT Election and (x) any of the ratios, tests or “baskets”
for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date are exceeded (or, with respect to the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, not reached) as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or “basket” (including due to
fluctuations of the target of any Limited Condition Transaction) at or prior to the consummation of the relevant
Limited Condition Transaction, such “baskets” or ratios and other provisions will be deemed not to have been
exceeded (or, with respect to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, not reached) as a result of such fluctuations solely
for purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition Transaction is permitted hereunder (provided, for the
avoidance of doubt, that the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may rely upon any improvement in any such ratio,
test or “basket” availability); (y) if any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any
continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the LCT
Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the
occurrence or continuation of an Default or Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed
to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to
have occurred or be continuing); and (z) in calculating the availability under any ratio, test or basket in connection
with any subsequent calculation of any ratio, test or “basket” availability on or following the relevant LCT Test Date
and prior to the earlier of (i) the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or (ii) the date
that the definitive agreement or Public Offer for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated or expires
without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test or “basket” availability shall be
calculated giving pro forma effect to, and assuming that, such Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions
in connection therewith (including any incurrence of debt and the use of proceeds thereof (but without netting the
cash proceeds thereof)) had been consummated. For the further avoidance of doubt, in the absence of an LCT
Election, unless specifically stated in the Indenture to be otherwise, all determinations of (x) compliance with any
financial ratio, test or amount (including any financial ratio, test or amount) and/or any cap expressed as a
percentage of Consolidated Total Assets, Consolidated Net Income or LTM EBITDA, or any other financial metric,
(y) the accuracy of any representation and warranties, or any requirement regarding the absence of a Default or
Event of Default (or any type of Default or Event of Default) or (z) any availability test under any “baskets” shall, in


-----

each case, be made as of the applicable date of the consummation of the relevant transaction or the time the
applicable action is taken, change is made, transaction is consummated or event occurs, as the case may be, and no
Default or Event of Default shall occur solely as a result of a change in any such financial ratio or test, amount,
financial metric, or “basket” availability occurring after such time.

**_Certain Compliance Calculations_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred or other transaction is undertaken
in reliance on a ratio basket, including based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio
or Consolidated Net Debt Ratio, such ratio(s) shall be calculated with respect to such incurrence, issuance or other
transaction without giving effect to amounts being utilized under any other basket (other than a ratio basket based on
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or Consolidated Net Debt Ratio) on the same
date. Each item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) that is incurred or
issued, each Lien incurred and each other transaction undertaken will be deemed to have been incurred, issued or
taken first, to the extent available, pursuant to the relevant Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured
Debt Ratio or Consolidated Net Debt Ratio test.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred or other transaction is undertaken
in reliance on a ratio basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or
Consolidated Net Debt Ratio, such ratio(s) shall be calculated without regard to the incurrence of any Indebtedness
under any revolving facility or letter of credit facility (1) immediately prior to or in connection therewith or (2) used
to finance working capital needs of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as reasonably determined by the
Issuer).

The Indenture will provide that any calculation or measure that is determined with reference to the Issuer’s
financial statements (including, without limitation, EBITDA, Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated Net
Income, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Net Debt Ratio, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Fixed
Charges, and clause (2)(a) of the first paragraph under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) may be determined
with reference to the financial statements of any Parent Entity of the Issuer instead, so long as such Parent Entity
does not hold any material assets other than, directly or indirectly, the Equity Interests of the Issuer (as determined
in good faith by the Issuer).

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and as noted below, will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly:

(I) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of the Issuer’s Equity
Interests (in each case, solely to a holder of Equity Interests in such Person’s capacity as a holder of such
Equity Interests), including any dividend, payment or distribution payable in connection with any
merger, amalgamation or consolidation other than:

(a) dividends, payments and distributions by the Issuer payable solely in Equity Interests (other than
Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase such Equity
Interests (other than Disqualified Stock); or

(b) dividends, payments and distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of any
dividend, payment or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of securities
issued by a Restricted Subsidiary other than a Wholly Owned Subsidiary, the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend, payment or distribution
in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of securities;

(II) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of the Issuer or
any Parent Entity, including any purchase, redemption, defeasance, acquisition or retirement in


-----

connection with any merger, amalgamation or consolidation, in each case held by a Person other than the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary;

(III) make any principal payment on, or redeem, repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value,
in each case, prior to any scheduled repayment, sinking fund payment or maturity, any Subordinated
Indebtedness, other than:

(a) Indebtedness permitted under clauses (7) and (8) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock
and Preferred Stock”; or

(b) the payment, redemption, purchase, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for
value of Subordinated Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund
obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of
payment, redemption, purchase, repurchase, defeasance or acquisition or retirement; or

(IV) make any Restricted Investment

(all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (I) through (IV) above (other than any exceptions thereto)
being collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of such Restricted Payment:

(1) other than with respect to a Restricted Investment, (x) no Event of Default described under clause (1) or
(2) or, solely with respect to the Issuer, clause (6) of the first paragraph of “—Events of Default and
Remedies” shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof and
(y) immediately after giving effect to such Restricted Payment, the Issuer is able to incur $1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph under the covenant described under “—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; and

(2) such Restricted Payment (including any Restricted Investment), together with the aggregate amount of
all other Restricted Payments made by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the Completion
Date (including Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (1) (without duplication) and 6(c) of the next
succeeding paragraph), but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the next succeeding
paragraph and any Permitted Investments), is less than the sum of (without duplication):

statements required pursuant to “—Reports and Other Information” have been delivered, or, at
the Issuer’s option, are internally available at the time of such Restricted Payment (which
amount, if less than $0 on a cumulative basis in any fiscal quarter shall be deemed to be $0 for
such fiscal quarter) and (ii) 100.0% of LTM EBITDA for the cumulative period (taken as one
accounting period) from the beginning of the fiscal quarter in which the Completion Date occurs
to the end of the Issuer’s most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial
statements required pursuant to “—Reports and Other Information” have been delivered, or, at
the Issuer’s option, are internally available at the time of such Restricted Payment less the
product of (x) 1.40 multiplied by (y) Fixed Charges for such period (which amount, if less than
$0 on a cumulative basis in any fiscal quarter, shall be deemed to be $0 for such fiscal quarter);
plus

(b) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds and the fair market value of marketable securities or
other property received by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries after the Completion Date
(other than Net Cash Proceeds to the extent such Net Cash Proceeds have been used to incur

second paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified
Stock and Preferred Stock”) from the issue or sale of:

actually contributed to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, Equity
Interests of the Issuer or any of the Issuer’s direct or indirect parent companies
(excluding contributions of the proceeds from the sale of Designated Preferred Stock
of any such companies or contributions to the extent such amounts have been applied
to Restricted Payments made in accordance with clause (4) of the next succeeding
paragraph); or

(ii) Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary that has been converted into or
exchanged for such Equity Interests of the Issuer or a Parent Entity;

_provided that this clause (b) shall not include the proceeds from (W) Refunding Capital_
Stock (as defined below) applied in accordance with clause (2) of the next succeeding
paragraph, (X) Equity Interests or convertible debt securities of the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary sold to a Restricted Subsidiary or to the Issuer, (Y) Disqualified Stock or debt
securities that have been converted into Disqualified Stock or (Z) Excluded Contributions;
plus

(c) 100% of the aggregate amount of Cash Equivalents and the fair market value of marketable

part of the capital of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary through consolidation, amalgamation or
merger following the Completion Date (other than (i) Net Cash Proceeds to the extent such Net
Cash Proceeds have been used to incur Indebtedness or issue Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock pursuant to clause (12)(a) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” (ii) contributions by a
Restricted Subsidiary and (iii) any Excluded Contributions); plus

releases of guarantees, which constitute Restricted Investments made by the Issuer or its
Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case after the Completion Date; or

(ii) the issuance, sale or other disposition (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary)
of the Equity Interests of, or a dividend or distribution (other than an Excluded
Contribution) from an Unrestricted Subsidiary (other than, in each case, to the extent the
Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary was made by the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary pursuant to clause (7) of the next succeeding paragraph or to the extent such
Investment constituted a Permitted Investment, but including such Cash Equivalents and

Subsidiary (or the assets transferred) at the time of the redesignation of such Unrestricted
Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or at the time of such merger, amalgamation, consolidation
or transfer of assets, other than to the extent the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary was
made by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to clause (7) of the next succeeding
paragraph or to the extent such Investment constituted a Permitted Investment made after the
Completion Date, but, to the extent exceeding the amount of such Permitted Investment,
including such excess amounts of fair market value; plus

(g) the aggregate amount of Declined Collateral Proceeds and Declined Proceeds since the
Completion Date; plus

(f) the aggregate amount of Non-Automotive DMS Business Line Cash Proceeds (or any portion

a portion thereof) meets the criteria of clauses (1) through (26) above and/or one or more of the clauses contained in
the definition of “Permitted Investments,” or is entitled to be made pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant,


-----

the Issuer will be entitled to divide or classify or later divide or reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the
date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment (or a portion thereof) between such clauses (1) through (26)
and such first paragraph and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” in
any manner that otherwise complies with this covenant.

As of the Completion Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are expected to be Restricted Subsidiaries. The Issuer
will not permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the penultimate
sentence of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the
extent repaid) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments in an amount determined as
set forth in the penultimate sentence of the definition of “Investments.” Such designation will be permitted only if a
Restricted Payment in such amount would be permitted at such time, pursuant to this covenant or pursuant to the
definition of “Permitted Investments,” and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants set forth in the Indenture.

For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not restrict the making of any “AHYDO catch-up payment” with
respect to, and required by the terms of, any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture.

issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise (collectively,
“incur” and collectively, an “incurrence”) with respect to any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and
the Issuer will not issue any shares of Disqualified Stock and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to issue any
shares of Disqualified Stock or any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor to issue Preferred
Stock; provided that the Issuer may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue shares of
Disqualified Stock, and any Restricted Subsidiary may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and
issue shares of Disqualified Stock and any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor may issue
shares of Preferred Stock, if (i) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio on a consolidated basis of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries would have been equal to or greater than the lesser of (x) 1.75 to 1.00 and (y) the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio as of, in each case, the most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal financial
statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such

Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been equal to or less than the greater of (x) 7.15 to 1.00 and (y) the
Consolidated Net Debt Ratio immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or
such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued, in the case of (i) and (ii), determined on a pro forma basis
(including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been
incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as the case may be, and the application of
proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period; provided that the then outstanding
aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock that may be incurred or issued (plus any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof), as applicable, pursuant
to this paragraph by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors shall not exceed the greater of
(a) $811.0 million and (b) 100.0% of LTM EBITDA (in each case, determined on the date of such incurrence).

The foregoing limitations will not apply to:

(1) Indebtedness incurred pursuant to any Credit Facilities by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and the
issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder (with letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances being deemed to have a principal amount equal to the face amount thereof);
_provided that immediately after giving effect to any such incurrence or issuance (including pro forma_
application of the net proceeds therefrom), the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of all
Indebtedness incurred or issued under this clause (1) does not exceed the sum of (a) (x) $4,250.0 million
plus (II) $1,000.0 million; provided that amounts outstanding under this subclause (a)(x)(II) shall be
unsecured or secured with a Lien junior in priority to the Lien securing the Notes, plus (y) an amount
equal to the greater of (A) $811.0 million and (B) 100.0% of LTM EBITDA, plus (z) any unused

incurrence of such additional amount but excluding any incurrence pursuant to clause (a) above

therewith and other appropriate pro forma adjustments of the net proceeds therefrom), (i) if such
Indebtedness would be secured by a Lien pari passu in priority with the Lien securing the Notes, the
Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio would have been equal to or less than the greater of (x) 5.50 to 1.00 or
(y) the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such Indebtedness
_provided that for purposes of determining the amount that may be incurred under this clause (1)(b)(i)_
only, all Indebtedness incurred under this clause (1)(b)(i) shall be deemed to be First Lien Obligations or
(ii) if such Indebtedness would be unsecured or secured with a Lien junior in priority to the Lien
securing the Notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Indebtedness would be secured by a
Lien pari passu in priority with the Lien securing the New Second Lien Credit Facility), the
Consolidated Net Debt Ratio would have been equal to or less than the greater of (x) 6.80 to 1.00 or
(y) the Consolidated Net Debt Ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such Indebtedness;

other property (whether real or personal) (whether through the direct purchase of property or the Equity
Interests of any Person owning such property); it being understood that any Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock incurred pursuant to this clause (4) shall cease to be deemed incurred or
outstanding for purposes of this clause (4) but shall be deemed incurred for the purposes of the first

meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock described in clauses (1) through (38) above or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the
first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, may divide or classify, and may from
time to time redivide and reclassify, such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or
any portion thereof) and will only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock in one or more of the above clauses or under the first paragraph of
this covenant; provided that (i) all Indebtedness outstanding under the New First Lien Credit Facilities
on the Completion Date will be treated as incurred on the Completion Date under clause (1) (A)(x)(I) of
the second paragraph above and may not be reclassified and (ii) all Indebtedness outstanding under the
New Second Lien Credit Facility on the Completion Date will be treated as incurred on the Completion
Date under clause (1)(a)(x)(II) of the second paragraph above and may not be reclassified;

(2) the Issuer will be entitled to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock in more than one of the types of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock described in
the first and second paragraphs above;

(3) guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that is
otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as incurred pursuant to any clause of the
second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or
other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, then such
other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation
preference thereof; and

(6) for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or
the Consolidated Net Debt Ratio, as applicable, in connection with the incurrence of any Indebtedness
pursuant to the first or second paragraph above or the creation or incurrence or any Lien pursuant to the
definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Issuer may elect, at its option, to treat all or any portion of the
committed amount of any Indebtedness (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances thereunder) which is to be incurred (or any commitment in respect thereof) or secured by
such Lien, as the case may be (any such committed amount elected until revoked as described below, the


-----

“Reserved Indebtedness Amount”), as being incurred as of such election date, and, if such Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or Consolidated Net Debt Ratio, as applicable, is
satisfied with respect thereto on such election date, any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing thereunder
(and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be deemed to
be permitted under this covenant or the definition of “Permitted Liens,” as applicable, whether or not the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or the Consolidated Net Debt Ratio,
as applicable, at the actual time of any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of
letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) is met; provided that for purposes of subsequent
calculations of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or the
Consolidated Net Debt Ratio, as applicable, the Reserved Indebtedness Amount shall be deemed to be
outstanding, whether or not such amount is actually outstanding, for so long as such commitments are
outstanding or until the Issuer revokes an election of a Reserved Indebtedness Amount.

Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue
discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, of the same class will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. If Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock originally incurred in reliance upon a percentage of LTM EBITDA under this covenant is being refinanced
and such refinancing would cause the maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
thereunder to be exceeded at such time, then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such
additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will be deemed to have been incurred under the
applicable provision so long as the principal amount or liquidation preference of such refinancing Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed the principal amount or liquidation preference of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced plus amounts permitted by the next sentence.
Any Refinancing Indebtedness and any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock permitted to be incurred
under the Indenture to refinance Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clauses (1), (12)(b), (23), (25), (29), (30) and
(31) above shall be deemed to include additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to pay
accrued but unpaid interest or dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting or
initial purchaser discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees)
in connection with such refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the U.S. Dollar Equivalent principal amount or liquidation
preference of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign currency shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock was incurred, in the case of a term obligation, or upon execution of the definitive credit
agreement, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign
currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if
calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollardenominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount or liquidation
preference of such refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed (a) the principal
amount or liquidation preference of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced plus
(b) the aggregate amount of accrued but unpaid interest, fees, underwriting or initial purchaser discounts, premiums
(including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar
fees) incurred in connection with such refinancing.

The principal amount or liquidation preference of any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, if incurred in a different currency
from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the
currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness
merely because it is unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness merely


-----

because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or because it is secured by different collateral or
issued or guaranteed by other obligors.

**_Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit the Co-Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien (except Permitted Liens) (each, a “Subject Lien”) that secures
Obligations under any Indebtedness, on any asset or property of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Guarantor, or any
income or profits therefrom, or assign or convey any right to receive income therefrom, unless:

(1) in the case of Subject Liens on any Collateral, (i) such Subject Lien expressly has priority that is junior
to the Liens on the Collateral relative to the Notes and the Guarantees or (ii) such Subject Lien is a
Permitted Lien; and

(2) in the case of any Subject Lien on any asset or property that is not Collateral, (i) the Notes (or a
Guarantee in the case of Subject Liens on assets or property of a Guarantor) are equally and ratably
secured with (or on a senior basis to, in the case such Subject Lien secures any Subordinated
Indebtedness) the Obligations secured by such Subject Lien until such time as such Obligations are no
longer secured by such Subject Lien or (ii) such Subject Lien is a Permitted Lien..

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to this covenant shall be deemed
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the Subject Lien that
gave rise to the obligation to secure the Notes. In addition, in the event that a Subject Lien is or becomes a Permitted
Lien, the Issuer may, at its option and without consent from any Holder, elect to release and discharge any Lien
created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the preceding paragraph in respect of such Subject Lien.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of
the incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of
original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

in good faith, is consummated shall be furnished within 90 days after the end of the fiscal quarter which they relate;
and all such current reports for triggering events occurring after the Completion Date shall be furnished within 15
days of the due date specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for reporting companies under the Exchange Act.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indenture will permit the Issuer to satisfy its obligations in this covenant
with respect to financial information relating to the Issuer by furnishing financial information (i) pursuant to IFRS at
any time IFRS is GAAP pursuant to the definition thereof and (ii) relating to any Parent Entity; provided that if such
Parent entity is not a Guarantor then the same is accompanied by selected financial metrics that show the differences
(in the Issuer’s sole discretion) between the information relating to such Parent Entity, on the one hand, and the
information relating to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the other hand.

The Issuer will be deemed to have furnished the reports referred to in clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph
of this covenant if the Issuer or any Parent Entity has filed reports containing such information (or any such
information of a Parent Entity) with the SEC. The Trustee shall have no obligation to determine if and when any
such reports have been filed with the SEC.

If the Issuer or any Parent Entity does not file reports containing such information with the SEC, then the Issuer
will make available such information and such reports to any Holder of the Notes and to any beneficial owner of the
Notes, in each case by posting such information on a password-protected website or online data system which will
require a confidentiality acknowledgment, and will make such information readily available to any bona fide
prospective investor, any securities analyst (to the extent providing analysis of investment in the Notes) or any
market maker in the Notes who agrees to treat such information as confidential; provided that the Issuer shall post
such information thereon and make readily available any password or other login information to any such bona fide
prospective investor, securities analyst or market maker; provided, however, that the Issuer may deny access to any
competitively-sensitive information otherwise to be provided pursuant to this covenant to any such Holder,
beneficial owner, bona fide prospective investor, securities analyst or market maker to the extent that the Issuer
determines in good faith that the provision of such information to such Person would be competitively harmful to
the Issuer and its Subsidiaries; and provided, further, that such Holders, beneficial owners, bona fide prospective
investors, securities analysts and market makers shall agree to (A) treat all such reports (and information contained
therein) as confidential, (B) not to use such reports (and the information contained therein) for any purpose other
than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (C) not publicly disclose any such reports (and the
information contained therein).

To the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer will furnish to Holders of the Notes, securities analysts
and prospective investors upon request the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under
the Securities Act.

If any Subsidiary of the Issuer is an Unrestricted Subsidiary and if any such Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of
Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the
Issuer, then the annual and quarterly information required by clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall
include a presentation of selected financial metrics (in the Issuer’s sole discretion) of such Unrestricted Subsidiaries
as a group in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Issuer will not be deemed to have failed to comply with any of
its obligations hereunder for purposes of clause (3) under “—Events of Default and Remedies” until 180 days after
the receipt of the written notice delivered thereunder.

To the extent any information is not provided within the time periods specified in this section “—Reports and
Other Information” and such information is subsequently provided, the Issuer will be deemed to have satisfied its
obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been
cured.

Delivery of the above reports to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such
reports shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from
information contained therein, including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants in this Indenture (as to
which the Trustee is entitled to rely conclusively on Officers’ Certificates).


-----

Beginning with the first fiscal quarter ending after the Completion Date, the Issuer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to participate in quarterly conference calls for all Holders of Notes, prospective investors, market
makers affiliated with any Initial Purchaser and securities analysists (which may be a single conference call together
with investors and lenders holding other securities or Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) to
discuss results of operations and, prior to the date of each such conference call, will announce (which announcement
may be through the password-protected or online datasite through which information is provided by the Issuer) the
time and date of such conference call and either include all information necessary to access the call or inform
Holders of Notes, prospective investors, market makers affiliated with any Initial Purchaser and securities analysists
how they can obtain such information, including, without limitation, the applicable password or login information (if
applicable); provided that such participation shall no longer be required following the consummation of an IPO.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an “Event of Default”:

(1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of principal of, or
premium, if any, on the Notes;

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the Notes;

(3) failure by the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by
the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in
clause (1) or (2) above) contained in the Indenture or the Notes;

(4) (i) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is
secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or
guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Notes, if both:

(a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated
final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an obligation other
than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and
results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due
prior to its stated maturity; and

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such
Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving effect to
any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, exceed the
greater of (x) $283.9 million and (y) 35.0% of LTM EBITDA (or its foreign currency equivalent);

(5) (i) failure by the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal
quarter end provided as required under “—Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of (x) $283.9 million
and (y) 35.0% of LTM EBITDA (net of amounts covered by insurance policies issued by reputable
insurance companies), which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of
more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by
insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or
decree which is not promptly stayed;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Significant
Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as of the latest consolidated financial
statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “—Reports and Other
Information”) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary);


-----

(7) the Guarantee of any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Subsidiary
Guarantors that together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal
quarter end provided as required under “—Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary) shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect or be declared null and
void or any responsible officer of the Issuers or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary
(or the responsible officers of any group of Subsidiary Guarantors that together (as of the latest
consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “—
Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), as the case may be, denies
in writing that it has any further liability under its Guarantee or gives written notice to such effect, other
than by reason of the termination of the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance
with the Indenture;

(8) the Liens created by the Notes Security Documents shall at any time not constitute a valid and perfected
Lien on any material portion of the Collateral intended to be covered thereby (unless perfection is not
required by the Indenture or the Notes Security Documents) other than (A) in accordance with the terms
of the relevant Notes Security Document and the Indenture, (B) the satisfaction in full of all Obligations
under the Indenture or (C) any loss of perfection that results from the failure of the Notes Collateral
Agent or other First Lien Representative, as applicable, to maintain possession of certificates delivered
to it representing securities pledged under the Security Documents and (ii) such default continues for 30
days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes;

(9) the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of
Subsidiary Guarantors that together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a
fiscal quarter end provided as required under “—Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary) shall assert, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any
security interest in any Notes Security Document is invalid or unenforceable; and

(10) the failure by the Issuers to consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption to the extent required, as
described under “—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above with respect to the Issuer) occurs and
is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of
all the then outstanding Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary
obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately.

The Trustee will not be charged with knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or knowledge of any cure of
any Default or Event of Default except for the occurrence of (1) or (2) above unless written notice of such Default or
Event of Default has been received by a responsible officer of the Trustee from the Issuers or by any Holder.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal of and premium, if any, and interest will be due and
payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of
the first paragraph of this section with respect to the Issuer, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable
without further action or notice. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice
of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it
determines that withholding notice is in their interest.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of all the then
outstanding Notes, by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing
Default and its consequences under the Indenture and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes and its
consequences (except if such rescission would conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and
except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of, any Note held by a
non-consenting Holder).

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) of the first paragraph of this section, such Event of
Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration


-----

of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the
Holders, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose:

(1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged;

(2) the requisite number of Holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as
the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of
the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless the
Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or
expense. Except to enforce the contractual right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when
due on or after the respective due dates expressed in an outstanding Note, no Holder of a Note may pursue any
remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) the Holders of at least 30% in the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have
requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) Holders of the Notes have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any
loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of
security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
direction inconsistent with such written request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions contained in the Indenture, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the
then outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however,
may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an
affirmative duty to ascertain whether or not any such directions are unduly prejudicial to any other Holder of a Note)
or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability, and may take any other action that is not inconsistent with any
such direction received from Holders of the Notes.

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding
compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuers are required, within 20 Business Days upon becoming aware of any
Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default (unless such Default has been cured or waived
within such 20-Business Day time period).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Managers, Officers, Members, Partners, Employees and Equityholders**

No past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner or direct or
indirect equityholder of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiaries or of any of their direct or indirect parent
companies (other than in such equityholder’s capacity as the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor) shall have any
liability, for any obligations of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Guarantees, the
Notes Security Documents or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations
or their creation. Each Holder by accepting Notes waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are
part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the
federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.


-----

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors under the Indenture with respect to the Notes, such Notes, the
Notes Security Documents and the Guarantees of such Notes, as the case may be, will terminate (other than certain
obligations) and will be released upon payment in full of all of the Notes. The Issuers may, at their option and at any
time, elect to have all of their obligations discharged with respect to the Notes and the Notes Security Documents
and have each Guarantor’s obligation discharged with respect to its Guarantee of the Notes (“Legal Defeasance”)
and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default except for:

(1) the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on the Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created pursuant to the
Indenture;

(2) the Issuers’ obligations with respect to Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of such
Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment
and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuers’ obligations in connection
therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuers may, at their option and at any time, elect to have their obligations and those of each
Guarantor released with respect to substantially all of the restrictive covenants that are described in the Indenture
with respect to the Notes (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations
shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance
occurs, certain events (not including bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining to the
Issuers) described under “—Events of Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute a Default or an Event of
Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes:

(1) the Issuers shall irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes,
cash in U.S. dollars, U.S. Government Securities, or a combination thereof in such amount as will be
sufficient, in the opinion of an Independent Financial Advisor, without consideration of any
reinvestment to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest due on such Notes on the stated
maturity date or on the redemption date, as the case may be, of such principal, premium, if any, or
interest on such Notes and the Issuers must specify whether such Notes are being defeased to maturity or
to a particular redemption date; provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the
Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent
that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of
the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the
“Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of
redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to
the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such
Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel
confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,

(a) the Issuers have received from, or there has been published by, the United States Internal
Revenue Service a ruling, or

(b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law,

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial owners of the Notes will not recognize income,


-----

gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial owners of the
Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such
Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not
occurred;

(4) no Event of Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such deposit
and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of
Liens in connection therewith) shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit;

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute
a default under any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to which the Issuer, the
Co-Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Guarantor is bound
(other than that resulting from any borrowing of funds to be applied to make the deposit required to
effect such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating
to other Indebtedness, and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith);

(6) the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not
made by the Issuers with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the
Issuers or any Guarantor or others; and

(7) the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which
Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all
conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance, as the
case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture with respect to the Notes will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes
(other than certain rights of the Trustee and the Issuers’ obligations with respect thereto), when either:

(1) all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes which have been
replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust, have been
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(2) (a) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by
reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise, will become due and payable within one
year or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for
the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuers, and the
Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the
Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, U.S.
Government Securities, or a combination thereof in such amounts as will be sufficient without
consideration of any reinvestment to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not
theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest
to the date of maturity or redemption; provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of
the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the
extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the
date of the notice of redemption, with any Applicable Premium Deficit only required to be deposited
with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth
in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable
Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such
redemption;


-----

(b) no Event of Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such
deposit or any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case,
the granting of Liens in connection therewith) with respect to the Indenture with respect to such
Notes or the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or shall
occur as a result of such deposit and such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to
which the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer, the Co-Issuer
or any Guarantor is bound (other than resulting from any borrowing of funds to be applied to
make such deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and,
in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith);

(c) the Issuers have paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by them under the Indenture with
respect to such Notes; and

(d) the Issuers have delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money
toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Issuers must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee stating
that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, any Guarantee, the Notes Security
Documents, any Initial Intercreditor Agreement or any other intercreditor agreement and the Notes may be amended
or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of all the Notes then
outstanding, including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
Notes, and any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the
principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes (which shall be considered waived only with respect to Notes
held by consenting Holders), except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or
compliance with any provision of the Indenture, any Guarantee, the Notes Security Documents, any Initial
Intercreditor Agreement or any other intercreditor agreement or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes, other than Notes beneficially owned by
the Issuers or their Affiliates (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, the Notes).

The Indenture will provide that, without the consent of each affected Holder of Notes, an amendment or waiver
may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or
waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed final maturity of any such Note or alter or waive the
provisions with respect to the redemption of such Notes (other than provisions relating to (a) notice
periods (to the extent consistent with applicable requirements of clearing and settlement systems) for
redemption and conditions to redemption and (b) the covenants described above under the caption “—
Repurchase at the option of Holders”);

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any such Note;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on such
Notes, except a rescission of acceleration of Notes by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of
all the then outstanding Notes, and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration,
or in respect of a covenant or provision contained in the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee which
cannot be amended or modified without the consent of all affected Holders;

(5) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated therein;


-----

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults;

(7) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions;

(8) amend the contractual right expressly set forth in the Indenture or the Notes of any Holder to institute
suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes on or after the due
dates therefor; or

(9) make any change to or modify the ranking of such Notes that would adversely affect the Holders.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of the Holders of at least 66-2/3% in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding, no amendment or waiver may (A) make any change in any Notes Security
Document or the provisions in the Indenture dealing with Collateral or application of trust proceeds of the Collateral
with the effect of releasing the Liens on all or substantially all of the Collateral which secure the Obligations in
respect of the Notes, (B) change or alter the priority of the Liens securing the Obligations in respect of the Notes in
any material portion of the Collateral in any way materially adverse, taken as a whole, to the Holders or (C) modify
the Guarantees of any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary, or any group of Subsidiary Guarantors
that, taken together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided
as required under “—Reports and Other Information”), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, in any manner
materially adverse to the Holders of such Notes, other than, in each case, as provided under the terms of the
Indenture, the Notes Security Documents or any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement then in effect (as applicable).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Guarantor (with respect to a Guarantee or the
Indenture to which it is a party), as the case may be, and, in each case the Notes Collateral Agent and/or the Trustee,
as applicable (and any other agents party thereto (to the extent applicable)), may amend or supplement the Indenture,
the Notes, the Security Documents, any Initial Intercreditor Agreement or any other intercreditor agreement, or any
Guarantee without the consent of any Holder:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that the
uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code);

(3) to comply with the covenant relating to mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and sales of assets;

(4) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s, the Co-Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s obligations to the
Holders;

(5) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or that does not
materially adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder;

(6) to add or modify covenants for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power conferred
upon the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or any Guarantor;

(7) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor Trustee
or a successor Paying Agent thereunder (or any other agents party thereto (to the extent applicable))
pursuant to the requirements thereof;

(9) to secure the Notes and/or the related Guarantees or to add collateral thereto;

(10) to add an obligor or a Guarantor under the Indenture;

(11) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents, the Initial Intercreditor
Agreements or any other applicable intercreditor agreement or any Guarantees to any provision of this
“Description of Notes”;


-----

(12) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Notes
as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation to facilitate the issuance and administration
of the Notes; provided, however, that such amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights
of Holders to transfer Notes;

(13) to release any Guarantor from its Guarantee pursuant to the Indenture when permitted or required by the
Indenture;

(14) to release and discharge any Lien securing the Notes when permitted or required by the Indenture
(including pursuant to the second paragraph under “Certain Covenants—Liens”), the Security
Documents, the Initial Intercreditor Agreements or any other applicable intercreditor agreement;

(15) to comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary;

(16) to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant any other Lien in favor of the Trustee or the Notes Collateral
Agent or other representative for the benefit of the Holders, as additional security for the payment and
performance of all or any portion of the Notes Obligations, in any property or assets, including any
which are required to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a Lien is required to be
granted to or for the benefit of the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to the Indenture, any
of the Security Documents, the Initial Intercreditor Agreements, any other applicable intercreditor

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee thereunder, should it become a
creditor of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or a Guarantor, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on
certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to
engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict within 90
days or resign.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes
will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy
available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that in case an Event of Default
shall occur (which shall not be cured) of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the
Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct of
his own affairs. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at
the request of any Holder of the Notes, unless such Holder shall have offered to the Trustee security and/or
indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense.

The obligations of the Trustee to any Holder will be subject to certain immunities and rights to be set forth in

than Indebtedness incurred or repaid under any revolving credit facility unless such Indebtedness has been


-----

permanently repaid and has not been replaced) or issues or redeems Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is being calculated but
prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made (the
“Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date”), then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving
pro forma effect to such incurrence, assumption, guarantee, redemption, repayment, retirement or extinguishment of
Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (in each case, including a pro
forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable fourquarter period, subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to the paragraphs contained in “—Certain Covenants—Certain
compliance calculations”; provided, however, that the pro forma calculation of Fixed Charges for purposes of the
first paragraph under “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” (and for the purposes of other provisions of the Indenture that refer to such
first paragraph) shall not give effect to any Indebtedness being incurred on such date (or on such other subsequent
date which would otherwise require pro forma effect to be given to such incurrence) pursuant to the second
paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified
Stock and Preferred Stock” (other than Secured Indebtedness incurred pursuant to subclause (2) of the proviso to
clause (14) thereof). For purposes of making the computation referred to above, Investments, acquisitions,
dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, discontinued operations (as determined in accordance with
GAAP), operational changes and Business Expansions that have been made by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to or
simultaneously with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date shall be calculated on a pro forma basis
assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, discontinued
operations, operational changes and Business Expansions (and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations
and the change in EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period. If
since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged,
amalgamated or consolidated with or into the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such
period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued
operation, operational change or Business Expansion that would have required adjustment pursuant to this
definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period
as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued operation,
operational change or Business Expansion had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period. For
purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to an Investment, acquisition, disposition,
merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued operation, operational change, Business Expansion or other
transaction (including the Transactions), the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible
financial or accounting officer of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries (and may include, for the avoidance of
doubt, cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies resulting from such Investment, acquisition,
disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued operation, operational change, Business Expansion
or other transaction (including the Transactions) which is being given pro forma effect) calculated in accordance
with and permitted by clause (b)(1) of the definition of “EBITDA.” If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of
interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in
effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period
(taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Capital Lease
Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or
accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capital Lease Obligation in accordance with
GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving
credit facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such
Indebtedness during the applicable period except as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on
Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a
eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen,
or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may designate.

provision hereof to eliminate the effect of any change in accounting principles or change as a result of the adoption

application thereof on the operation of such provision, regardless of whether any such notice is given before or after
such change in GAAP or IFRS, as applicable, or in the application thereof, then such provision shall be interpreted
on the basis of GAAP or IFRS, as applicable, as in effect and applied immediately before such change shall have
become effective until such notice shall have been withdrawn or such provision amended in accordance with this
definition, (ii) GAAP shall be construed, and all computations of amounts and ratios referred to in the Indenture
shall be made, without giving effect to any election under FASB Accounting Standards Codification 825—Financial

extent applicable, the equivalent standard under IFRS), to value any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Subsidiary at

statements in IFRS, (v) neither IFRS nor U.S. GAAP shall include the policies, rules and regulations of the SEC, the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the International Accounting Standards Board or any other
applicable regulatory or governing body applicable only to public companies and (vi) any calculation or
determination in the Indenture that requires the application of GAAP or IFRS across multiple quarters need not be
calculated or determined using the same accounting standard for each constituent quarter. The Issuer will give notice
of any such election made in accordance with this definition to the Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) solely
making an election (without any other action) referred to in this definition will not (1) be treated as an incurrence of
Indebtedness or (2) have the effect of rendering invalid any payment, Investment or other action made prior to the
date of such election pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted
Payments” or any incurrence of Indebtedness incurred prior to the date of such election pursuant to the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified

**BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

The Notes offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A (“Rule 144A Notes”) will
be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global
Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will be deposited with a custodian for DTC, and registered in the name of Cede &
Co., as nominee of DTC.

The Notes sold in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S (the “Regulation S Notes”) will be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S
Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC
and deposited with a custodian for DTC, for credit to Euroclear and Clearstream. The Regulation S Global Notes
will initially be represented by temporary global notes in form without interest coupons (the “Temporary Regulation
S Global Notes”). After the 40th day following the later of the commencement of this offering and the closing of this
offering (such period through and including such 40th day, the “Distribution Compliance Period”), the Temporary
Regulation S Global Notes may be exchanged for permanent Regulation S Global Notes.

The Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes are collectively referred to herein as the
“Global Notes.”

**The Global Notes**

**_General_**

The Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with the Trustee as custodian for DTC, and registered in the
name of DTC or its nominee, in each case for credit to an account of a Participant (as defined below) or Indirect
Participant (as defined below) in DTC as described below. The Notes will be issued at the closing of this offering
only against payment in immediately available funds. Except as set forth below, the Notes will be issued in
registered, global form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.

Until the end of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Notes may
be held only through Euroclear and Clearstream (as Indirect Participants in DTC), unless transferred to a person that
takes delivery through a Rule 144A Global Note in accordance with the certification requirements described below.

Beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in the
Regulation S Global Notes at any time except in the limited circumstances described below. See “—Exchanges
among Global Notes.”

**_Depository Procedures_**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC is provided solely as a matter of
convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and
are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to
contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New
York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal
Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing
agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold
securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and
settlement of transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts
of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks,
trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to
other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial
relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who
are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the

256


-----

Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on
behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants.

DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

(1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial

purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and

(2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these

interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by
the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the
Global Notes).

Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein
directly through DTC. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests
therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants in DTC. All
interests in the Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Investors in the Regulation
S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in
those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Distribution
Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes through
Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests
in Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their
respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of
Euroclear, and Citibank N.A., as operator of Clearstream which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities
accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Interests in a Global Note held through Euroclear or
Clearstream may be subject to the procedures and requirements of those systems (as well as to the procedures and
requirements of such systems). The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in
definitive form of securities that they own and the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to Persons
that are subject to those requirements will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of
Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in
a Global Note to pledge those interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take
actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing those interests.

Except as described below, beneficial owners of an interest in the Global Notes will not have notes registered in
their names, will not receive physical delivery of notes in registered certificated form (“Certificated Notes”) and will
not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the indenture that will govern the Notes for any
purpose.

Payments in respect of the principal of and premium and interest on a Global Note registered in the name of
DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the indenture that will
govern the Notes. Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the Notes, the Issuers and the Trustee will treat
the Persons in whose names notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such notes for the
purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuers, the Trustee or any
agent of the Issuers or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

(1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments

made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the
beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or

(2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect

Participants.

DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the
Notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the
payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant
Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount


-----

of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants
to the beneficial owners of the Notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be
the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the
Trustee or the Issuers. None of the Issuers nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its
Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of any the Notes, and the Issuers and the Trustee may conclusively
rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of
one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests of the Global Notes and only in respect of
such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Note as to which such Participant or Participants has or have
given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange
the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its Participants.

Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between Participants in DTC
will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds and transfers between
participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating
procedures.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described herein, cross-market
transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand,
will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, by its respective depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to
Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and
procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the
case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective
depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant
Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds
settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions
directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of Notes only at the direction
of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect
of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which that Participant or those Participants has or
have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Notes, DTC reserves the right
to exchange the Global Notes for legended Notes in certificated form, and to distribute those Notes to its
Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in Global Notes among Participants, they are under no obligation to perform those
procedures, and may discontinue or change those procedures at any time.

None of the Issuers nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the
performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective Participants or Indirect Participants of their
respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**_Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes_**

A Global Note is exchangeable for a Certificated Note if:

  - DTC (a) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the applicable Global Notes
or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in each case, a successor
depositary is not appointed;

  - we at our option, notify, the Trustee in writing that we elect to cause the issuance of Certificated Notes; or

  - there has occurred and is continuing a Default or event of default with respect to the Global Notes.

In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon prior written
notice given to the Issuers and the Registrar by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the indenture that will


-----

govern the Notes. In all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in
a Global Note will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf
of the depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures) and will bear the applicable restrictive legend
referred to in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by applicable law.

**_Exchange of Certificated Notes for Global Notes_**

If Certificated Notes are issued in the future, they will not be exchangeable for beneficial interests in any Global
Note unless the transferor first delivers to the Issuers and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in
the indenture that will govern the Notes) to the effect that the transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer
restrictions applicable to the Notes being transferred. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_Exchanges Among Global Notes_**

Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note
may be transferred only to non-U.S. persons under Regulation S, qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A or
institutional accredited investors. Beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be exchanged for
beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note only if:

  - the exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the relevant Notes pursuant to Rule 144A; and

  - the transferor first delivers to the Issuers and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in the
indenture that will govern the Notes) to the effect that the Notes are being transferred:

    - to a Person who (i) the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer within the
meaning of Rule 144A and (ii) is purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified
institutional buyer in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A; and

    - in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other
jurisdictions.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form
of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Distribution Compliance
Period, only if the transferor first delivers to the Issuers and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided
in the indenture that will govern the Notes) to the effect that the transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903
or Rule 904 of Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available) and that, if such transfer occurs prior to the expiration of the
Distribution Compliance Period, the interest transferred will be held immediately thereafter through Euroclear or
Clearstream.

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between a Regulation S Global Note and a Rule 144A
Global Note will be effected in DTC by means of an instruction originated by the DTC Participant through the DTC
Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments
will be made to reflect the changes in the principal amounts of the Regulation S Global Note and the Rule 144A
Global Note, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a Person who
takes delivery in the form of an interest in another Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such
Global Note and will become an interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all
transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interest in such other Global Note for so long as it
remains such an interest. The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial interests in the
Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period.

**_Same Day Settlement and Payment_**

The Issuers will make payments in respect of the Notes represented by the Global Notes, including payments of
principal, premium, if any, and interest by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by
the Global Note Holder. The Issuers will make all payments of principal of and premium, if any, with respect to the
Certificated Notes by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holders of the
Certificated Notes or, if no account is specified, by mailing a check to each Holder’s registered address. The Notes


-----

represented by the Global Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System,
and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such Notes represented will, therefore, be required by DTC
to be settled in immediately available funds. We expect that secondary trading in any Certified Notes will also be
settled in immediately available funds. Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or
Clearstream participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a Participant will be credited, and any such
crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement
processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement
date of DTC. DTC has advised us that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a
Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a Participant will be received with value on the
settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the
business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

**U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of Notes
purchased in this offering at the “issue price,” which we assume will be the price indicated on the cover of this
offering memorandum, and held as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

This discussion does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your
particular circumstances, including alternative minimum tax and Medicare contribution tax consequences, the
application of Section 451(b) of the Code (as defined below) with respect to conforming the timing of income
accruals to financial statements, as well as differing tax consequences that may apply if you are, for instance:

  - a financial institution;

  - a regulated investment company;

  - a real estate investment trust;

  - a dealer or trader in securities that uses a mark-to-market method of tax accounting;

  - a person holding Notes as part of a “straddle” or integrated transaction;

  - a U.S. Holder (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

  - a U.S. expatriate;

  - a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for more than 182 days in a taxable year;

  - a tax-exempt entity; or

  - a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If you are a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of your
partners will generally depend on the status of the partners and your activities.

This summary is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended to the date hereof (the “Code”),
administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final, temporary and proposed Treasury Regulations, changes
to any of which subsequent to the date of this offering memorandum may affect the tax consequences described
herein, possibly on a retroactive basis. This summary does not address any aspect of state, local or non-U.S.
taxation, or any taxes other than income taxes. You should consult your tax adviser with regard to the application of
the U.S. federal tax laws to your particular situation, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any
state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

**Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders**

This section applies to you if you are a U.S. Holder. You are a U.S. Holder if you are a beneficial owner of a
Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

  - a citizen or individual resident of the United States;

  - a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States, any state therein or the District of Columbia; or

  - an estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.

**_Certain Additional Payments_**

Under certain circumstances, such as those described under “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option
of Holders—Change of Control,” we might be required to make payments on the Notes that would increase the yield


-----

of the Notes. In addition, if the Acquisition is not consummated by the Escrow End Date or upon the occurrence of
certain other events, we would generally be required to redeem the Notes prior to their stated maturity, as described
under “Description of Notes—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” We intend to take the
position that the possibility that any such payments will be made does not cause the Notes to be treated as contingent
payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. Our position is binding on you unless you
disclose a contrary position in the manner required by the applicable Treasury regulations. Our position is not
binding, however, on the IRS. If the IRS were to take a contrary position, a holder of Notes may be required to
accrue interest income on the Notes based upon a “comparable yield,” as defined in the Treasury Regulations,
determined at the time of issuance of the Notes (which yield is not expected to differ significantly from the actual
yield on the Notes), with adjustments to such accruals when any contingent payments are made that differ from the
payments based on the comparable yield. In addition, any income on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of the Notes would be treated as interest income rather than as capital gain. You should consult your tax
adviser regarding the tax consequences if the Notes are treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The
remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**_Payments of Interest_**

Stated interest on a Note will be taxable to you as ordinary interest income at the time it accrues or is received,
in accordance with your method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is expected, and this
discussion assumes, that the Notes will be issued without original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (“OID”). In general, however, if the Notes are issued with OID at or above a de minimis threshold, you
would be required to include OID in gross income as ordinary income, as it accrues, in accordance with a constantyield method based on a compounding of interest before the receipt of cash payments attributable to this income.

**_Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**

Upon the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note, you will recognize taxable gain or loss in an amount equal
to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or other taxable disposition and your adjusted tax basis in
the Note. Your adjusted tax basis in a Note will be equal to the cost of your Note. For these purposes, the amount
realized does not include any amount attributable to accrued interest, which is treated as described under “Payments
of Interest” above.

Gain or loss recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note will generally be capital gain or loss
and will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of the sale or other taxable disposition the Note has been held
for more than one year. Long-term capital gains recognized by non-corporate taxpayers are subject to reduced tax
rates. The deductibility of capital losses may be subject to limitations.

**Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders**

This section applies to you if you are a Non-U.S. Holder. You are a Non-U.S. Holder if you are a beneficial
owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, an individual, corporation, estate or trust that is a not a
U.S. Holder.

**_Payments on the Notes_**

Subject to the discussions below under “Backup Withholding and Information Reporting” and “FATCA
Legislation,” payments of principal and interest on the Notes by the Issuers or any paying agent to you generally
will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax, provided that, in the case of interest,

  - you do not own, actually or constructively, stock possessing 10% or more of the total combined voting
power of all classes of the stock of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or the Company entitled to vote;

  - you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or the Company
directly or constructively through equity ownership;

  - you certify on a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable form), under
penalties of perjury, that you are not a United States person; and


-----

  - the interest is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States, as
described below.

If you cannot satisfy one of the first three requirements described above, and interest on the Notes is not exempt
from withholding because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States, as
described below, payments of interest on the Notes will be subject to withholding tax at a rate of 30%, or a lower
rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty.

**_Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**

Subject to the discussion below under “Backup Withholding and Information Reporting” and “FATCA
Legislation,” you generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on gain recognized on a
sale, redemption or other taxable disposition of Notes, unless the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of
a trade or business in the United States as described below, although any amounts attributable to accrued interest
will be treated as described above under “Payments on the Notes.”

**_Effectively Connected Income_**

If interest or gain on a Note is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United
States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment or fixed
base maintained by you), you will generally be taxed in the same manner as a U.S. Holder on these amounts (see
“Tax consequences to U.S. Holders” above). In that case, you will be exempt from the withholding tax on interest
discussed above, although you will be required to provide a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI in order to claim
an exemption from withholding. You should consult your tax adviser with respect to other U.S. tax consequences of
owning and disposing of Notes, including the possible imposition of a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower
treaty rate) if you are a corporation.

**Backup Withholding and Information Reporting**

Information returns will be filed with the IRS in connection with payments on the Notes made to, and the
proceeds of dispositions of Notes effected by, certain U.S. Holders. Information returns will be filed with the IRS in
connection with payments of interest on the Notes made to Non-U.S. Holders, and information returns may also be
filed with the IRS in connection with the proceeds from a disposition of a Note unless the Non-U.S. Holder complies
with certification procedures to establish that it is not a United States person. In addition, certain U.S. Holders may
be subject to backup withholding in respect of such amounts if they do not provide their taxpayer identification
numbers to the person from whom they receive payments and otherwise comply with applicable requirements of the
backup withholding rules or you provide proof of an applicable exemption. Non-U.S. Holders may be required to
comply with applicable certification procedures to establish that they are not U.S. Holders in order to avoid the
application of such information reporting requirements and backup withholding. The amount of any backup
withholding from a payment to a U.S. or Non-U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit against the holder’s U.S.
federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely
furnished to the IRS.

**FATCA Legislation**

Legislation commonly referred to as “FATCA” imposes a withholding tax of 30% on certain payments to
“foreign financial institutions” (which term is broadly defined for this purpose and in general includes investment
vehicles) and certain other non-U.S. entities unless various U.S. information reporting and due diligence
requirements (generally relating to ownership by U.S. persons of interests in or accounts with those entities) have
been satisfied, or an exemption applies. Withholding under FATCA will apply to the applicable payments regardless
of whether the recipient is a beneficial owner or acts as an intermediary with respect to such payments. Foreign
financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States with
respect to FATCA may be subject to different rules. FATCA withholding (if applicable) applies to payments of
interest on the Notes. While existing Treasury Regulations would also require withholding on payments of gross
proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the Notes, the U.S. Treasury Department has indicated in subsequent
proposed regulations its intent to eliminate this requirement (other than with regard to amounts treated as interest).
The U.S. Treasury Department has indicated that taxpayers may rely on these proposed regulations pending their


-----

finalization. If FATCA withholding is imposed, a beneficial owner that is not a foreign financial institution
generally will be entitled to a refund of any amounts withheld by filing a U.S. federal income tax return (which may
entail significant administrative burden). Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers regarding the effects
of FATCA on their investment in the Notes.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

**General Fiduciary and Prohibited Transaction Issues**

The U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), imposes certain
requirements on “employee benefit plans” (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) subject to Title I of ERISA and on
entities that are deemed to hold “plan assets” of such employee benefit plans (collectively, “ERISA Plans”), and on
those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s
general fiduciary requirements, including, but not limited to, the requirement of investment prudence and
diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents
governing the ERISA Plan.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the
administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who
renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a
fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an
ERISA Plan (as well as those plans, accounts or arrangements that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to
Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts and entities that are deemed to hold the assets of
such plans, accounts or arrangements (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”)) with certain persons (referred to as
“parties in interest” under ERISA or “disqualified persons” under the Code) having certain relationships to such
Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or
disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other
penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of a Plan that engages in such a nonexempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

Any Plan fiduciary which proposes to cause a Plan to purchase or hold the Notes (or any interest therein) should
consider the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA and the prohibited transaction
provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code to such purchase or holding, and confirm that such purchase and
holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable
requirement of ERISA or the Code.

Non-U.S. plans, governmental plans and certain church plans (collectively, “Non-ERISA Arrangements”),
while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of
ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to non-U.S., state, local or other federal laws or
regulations that are similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”).
Fiduciaries of any Non-ERISA Arrangements subject to Similar Laws should consult with their counsel before
purchasing or holding the Notes (or any interest therein) regarding the potential consequences of an investment in
the Notes under any applicable Similar Laws and the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive
relief under any such Similar Laws.

Each Plan and Non-ERISA Arrangement should consider the fact that none of the Issuers, the Guarantors, the
initial purchasers or any of their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as
a fiduciary to any Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The
Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular
investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes
(or any interest therein). All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with
respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes,
and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes (or any interest therein) for any
specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes (or any interest therein) must be made solely by
each prospective Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement purchaser on an arm’s length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Exemptions**

The fiduciary of a Plan that proposes to purchase or hold any Notes (or interest therein) should consider, among
other things, whether such purchase and holding may involve (i) the direct or indirect extension of credit to a party


-----

in interest or a disqualified person, (ii) the sale or exchange of any property between a Plan and a party in interest or
a disqualified person, or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or disqualified person,
of any Plan assets. Such parties in interest or disqualified persons could include, without limitation, the Transaction
Parties. Depending on the satisfaction of certain conditions which may include the identity of the Plan fiduciary
making the decision to acquire or hold the Notes (or any interest therein) on behalf of a Plan, Section 408(b)(17) of
ERISA or Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code (for certain transactions involving non-fiduciary service providers or
their affiliates) or the Prohibited Transaction Class Exemptions (“PTCE”) issued by the United States Department of
Labor, including but not limited to PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by a “qualified professional asset
manager”), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38
(relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by insurance
company general accounts) or PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions directed by an in-house asset manager) could
provide an exemption from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. However,
there can be no assurance that any of these statutory exemptions, PTCEs or any other exemption will be available
with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes (or any interest therein).

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing the assets of any
Plan, unless such purchase and holding would not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or any violation of applicable Similar Laws.

**Representations**

By its acquisition of any Note (or any interest therein), the purchaser or transferee thereof will be deemed to
have represented and warranted that either: (i) no portion of the assets used by the purchaser or transferee to acquire
or hold the Notes (or any interest therein) constitutes the assets of any Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement; or (ii) (x)
the acquisition, holding and disposition of such Notes (or any interest therein) by such purchaser or transferee will
not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code or violation under any applicable Similar Law and (y) none of the Transaction Parties is acting as a fiduciary
of such purchaser or transferee with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes (or any interest therein) or
is undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or give advice in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the
decision to purchase or hold the Notes (or any interest therein).

**The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive, nor should it be**
**construed as legal advice. Each fiduciary of a Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement should consult with its legal**
**advisor concerning the potential consequences to the Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement under ERISA,**
**Section 4975 of the Code or Similar Laws of an investment in the Notes (or any interest therein). The sale of a**
**Note (or any interest therein) to a Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement is in no respect a representation by any**
**Transaction Party or any of their respective representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal**
**requirements with respect to investments by any such Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement or that such**
**investment is appropriate for any such Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement. Additionally, neither the forgoing**
**discussion nor anything in this offering memorandum is or is intended to be investment advice directed at**
**any purchaser or holder that is using assets of a Plan or Non-ERISA Arrangement, or at such purchasers or**
**holders generally. Purchasers of the Notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase**
**and holding of the Notes complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and does not violate the**
**prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or applicable Similar Laws.**

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable securities
law and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as
such terms are defined under the Securities Act) except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and such other securities laws. Accordingly, the Notes

other applicable securities law, the Notes are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring
registration under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A,
and none of the Notes may be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the

and was not a U.S. person (and was not purchasing for the account or benefit of a U.S. person) within

(3) It acknowledges that none of the Issuers, the Guarantors or the initial purchasers or any person representing

the Issuers or the Guarantors or the initial purchasers has made any representation to it with respect to the
Issuers, the Guarantors or the offering or sale of any Notes, other than the information included in this
offering memorandum, which offering memorandum has been delivered to it. Accordingly, it
acknowledges that no representation or warranty is made by the initial purchasers as to the accuracy or
completeness of such materials. It has had access to such financial and other information as it has deemed
necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask
questions of and request information from the Issuers, the Guarantors and the initial purchasers, and it has
received and reviewed all information that it requested.

(4) It is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is acting as

a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection

disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or
their control and subject to its or their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or
any exemption from registration available under the Securities Act. It agrees on its own behalf and on
behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the Notes and each subsequent holder of the Notes
by its acceptance thereof will agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the date which is
one year after the later of the date of the original issue of the Notes, the original issue date of any additional

statement which has been declared effective under the Securities Act, (c) for so long as the Notes are

property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and to compliance
with any applicable state securities laws. The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to
the Resale Restriction Termination Date. Each purchaser acknowledges that we and the Registrar reserve
the right prior to any offer, sale or other transfer pursuant to clause (d) prior to the end of the 40-day
distribution compliance period within the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act or pursuant to
clauses (e) or (f) prior to the Resale Restriction Termination Date of the Notes to require the delivery of an
opinion of counsel, certifications and/or other information satisfactory to us.

Each certificate representing a Note will include a legend substantially to the following effect:

-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) among the
Issuers and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as representative of the several initial purchasers, we have agreed
to sell to the initial purchasers, and the initial purchasers have agreed to purchase from us, severally and not jointly,
all of the Notes.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the initial purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of
the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The initial purchasers have agreed to resell the Notes (a) in the United States to persons who they reasonably
believe are QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and (b) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore
transactions in compliance with Regulation S, in each case, under the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.”
The Notes will initially be offered at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering of the
Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the initial
purchasers. The initial purchasers reserve the right to reject an order of Notes in whole or in part.

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be
required to make in respect thereof.

We have agreed that, for a period of 30 days after the date of this offering memorandum, we will not, directly or
indirectly, take any of the following actions with respect to any United States dollar-denominated debt securities
issued or guaranteed by the Issuers, the Company, the Guarantors or any of their respective subsidiaries and having
a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any of its securities (“Lock-Up Securities”): (i) offer, sell, issue, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise
dispose of Lock-Up Securities, (ii) offer, sell, issue, contract to sell, contract to purchase or grant any option, right or
warrant to purchase Lock-Up Securities, (iii) enter into any swap, hedge or any other agreement that transfers, in
whole or in part, the economic consequences of ownership of Lock-Up Securities, (iv) establish or increase a put
equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position in Lock-Up Securities within the meaning of
Section 16 of the Exchange Act or (v) file with the SEC a registration statement under the Securities Act relating to
Lock-Up Securities or publicly disclose the intention to take any such action, without the prior written consent of the
representative.

The offer and sale of Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and the Notes may
not be offered or sold except as set forth above. Prior to the offering, there has been no active market for the Notes.
As a result, we cannot assure you that the initial prices at which the Notes will sell in the market after this offering
will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the Notes will develop and
continue after completion of this offering. We do not intend to apply for listing of the Notes on any national
securities exchange or for inclusion of the Notes on any automated dealer quotation system. The initial purchasers
have advised us that they presently intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable laws and
regulations. The initial purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes and any such market
making may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the initial purchasers. In addition, market-making
activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the Exchange Act, and may be limited. Accordingly, no assurance
can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made to investors on or about    , 2022, which will be the
business day following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement being referred to as “T+     “).
Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the
secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree
otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes hereunder more than two business days prior to the
scheduled closing date for this offering will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially settle in T+
, to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement.
Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes hereunder during such period should consult their advisors.

In connection with sales outside the United States, the initial purchasers have agreed that they will not offer, sell
or deliver the Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, United States persons (1) as part of their distribution at any


-----

time or (2) otherwise prior to 40 days after the closing of the offering. The initial purchasers will send to any dealer
to whom they sell Notes during such period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and
sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, United States persons.

If any of the initial purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us, certain of those initial
purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may
hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, these initial
purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the
purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes
offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the
notes offered hereby.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in Canada**

The notes may be sold only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal that are
accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the
Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted clients, as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration
Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the notes must be made in
accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable
securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for
rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contain a misrepresentation,
provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed
by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable
provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights or
consult with a legal advisor.

Pursuant to section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (NI 33-105), the initial
purchasers are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding initial purchaser
conflicts of interest in connection with this offering.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, (a) a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended or superseded, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive
(EU) 2016/97 (as amended or superseded, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as
defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended or superseded, the “Prospectus Regulation”) and (b) the
expression “offer” includes the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms
of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes.
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs
Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has
been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor
in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the
basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the
Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This offering memorandum
is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**Prohibition of Sales to United Kingdom Retail Investors**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, (a) a retail
investor in the UK means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act


-----

2018 (as amended, the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (as amended, the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the
Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point
(8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii)
not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA and (b) the expression “offer” includes the communication in any form and by any means of
sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to
purchase or subscribe for the Notes. Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation
as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK
PRIIPs Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK
will be made pursuant to an exemption under Section 86 of the FSMA from the requirement to publish a prospectus
for offers of Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the FSMA.

experiences for consumers. Today, CDK serves over 15,000 retail locations in North America.

**Basis of Preparation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance**
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and the rules and
regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The preparation of the financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect assets, liabilities,
revenue, and expenses that are reported in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual
results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of
management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. Interim financial results are
not necessarily indicative of financial results for a full year. The financial statements in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2021 (the “Annual Report”).

**Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

The Company’s significant accounting policies are described in the aforementioned Annual Report. Included
below are certain updates to those policies.

**Funds Receivable and Funds Held for Clients and Client Fund Obligations. Funds receivable and funds**
held for clients represent amounts received or expected to be received from clients in advance of performing titling
and registration services on behalf of those clients. These amounts are classified in other current assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total amount due to remit for titling and registration obligations with the
department of motor vehicles is recorded to client fund obligations which is classified as accrued expenses and other
current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Funds receivable was $42.0 million and $42.7 million, and
funds held for clients was $19.4 million and $20.2 million as of March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively.
Client fund obligations were $61.4 million and $62.9 million as of March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively.

**Internal Use Software and Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. The Company**
incurred expenses to research, develop, and deploy new and enhanced solutions of $23.6 million and $19.4 million
for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $59.7 million and $55.7 million for the nine
months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These expenses were classified in cost of revenue on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, the Company had cash flows used for qualifying capitalized
software development cost of $83.7 million and $51.0 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively.

**Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets,**
accounts payable, and other current liabilities are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at cost, which
approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of the Company’s
revolving credit facility (as described in Note 10 - Debt), including accrued interest, approximates fair value based
on the Company’s current estimated incremental borrowing rate for similar types of arrangements.

**Investments. The carrying amount of equity investments, included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance**
Sheets include $21.0 million and $20.0 million as of March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively, related to
equity investments that are accounted for under the cost method as they do not have a readily determinable fair


-----

value. The remaining investments, which are accounted for under the equity method, totaled $25.3 million and $30.4
million as of March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively.

**Note 3. New Accounting Pronouncements**

**Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements. In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards**
Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740):
Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,” (“ASU 2019-12”), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes
in various areas. ASU 2019-12 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2020, including interim periods therein. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 on July 1, 2021. The adoption of the
new standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08 “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for
Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts With Customers” (“ASU 2021-08”). ASU 2021-08 requires
companies to apply “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” (“ASC 606”) when recognizing and
measuring contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination. ASU 2021-08 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company elected to adopt ASU 2021-08 effective October 1, 2021. ASU 2021-08 will apply to all
business combinations that occur during fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. The adoption of the new standard did not
have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

**Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements. In July 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-05 “Leases**
(Topic 842): Lessors — Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments,” (“ASU 2021-05”). ASU 2021-05 requires
lessors to classify leases as operating leases if they have variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or
rate and would have selling losses if they were classified as sales-type or direct financing leases. ASU 2021-05 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The
Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

**Note 4. Discontinued Operations**

**International Business. On March 1, 2021, the Company completed its sale of the CDK International business**
(“International Business”) to Francisco Partners. The Company provided limited services to Francisco Partners to
assist in the integration of the International Business through February 2022. The financial results are presented in
net earnings from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.

**Digital Marketing Business. On April 21, 2020, the Company completed its sale of the Digital Marketing**
Business to Sincro LLC, a newly formed company owned by Ansira Partners, Inc., which is a subsidiary of Advent
International.

The following table summarizes the comparative financial results of discontinued operations which are
presented in net earnings from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations:

**Note 5. Acquisition**

Salty Dot, Inc. On October 1, 2021, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity of Salty Dot,
Inc.(“Salty”), a privately held automobile insurance technology solution provider. The acquisition is being recorded
using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed to be recognized at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Under the acquisition method,
total consideration was determined to be $181.6 million, subject to customary adjustments. Total consideration
includes the fair value of contingent payments. The fair value of contingent payments, determined using an option
pricing model, was estimated at $23.7 million as of the acquisition date. The range of contingent payments is zero to
$147.0 million with the final amount dependent on the achievement of certain revenue and gross margin milestones
over the 3-year period following acquisition.

The following table summarizes the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the
acquisition date, subject to the finalized purchase price allocation:

Cash and cash equivalents ..................................................................................................................... $ 6.2
Intangible assets .................................................................................................................................... 38.1
Other assets............................................................................................................................................ 0.9
Other liabilities ...................................................................................................................................... (4.7)
Total identifiable net assets ................................................................................................................... $ 40.5
Goodwill ................................................................................................................................................ 141.1

Total consideration ................................................................................................................................ $ 181.6

The intangible assets acquired primarily relate to software that is being amortized over a useful life of 8 years.
The goodwill resulting from this acquisition reflects expected synergies resulting from adding Salty products and
processes to the Company’s portfolio. The acquired goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

The results of operations for Salty has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations from the
date of acquisition.

**Note 6. Revenue**

**Contract Balances**

**_Accounts Receivable_**

A receivable is recorded when an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment exists, such that only the
passage of time is required before payment of consideration is due. The Company receives payments from
customers based upon contractual billing schedules. Payment terms can vary by contract, but the period between
invoicing and when payments are due is not significant. The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the
timing of invoicing to customers. Included in accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are unbilled
receivable balances which have not yet been invoiced. As of March 31, 2022, the balance of accounts receivable, net
of allowances for doubtful accounts, was $241.6 million, inclusive of unbilled receivables of $1.5 million. As of
June 30, 2021, the balance of accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, was $236.4 million,
inclusive of unbilled receivables of $1.8 million.


-----

**_Contract Assets_**

A contract asset is recognized when a conditional right to consideration exists and transfer of control has
occurred. Contract assets are typically related to subscription contracts where the transaction price allocated to the
satisfied performance obligation exceeds the value of billings to-date. Contract assets are reported in a net position
on a contract-by-contract basis and are included in other current assets for the current portion and other assets for the
long-term portion on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company regularly reviews contract asset balances for
impairment, considering factors such as historical experience, credit-worthiness, age of the balance, and other
economic or business factors. Refer to Note 8 – Allowance for Credit Losses for more information about credit
losses. Contract asset impairments were not significant in the nine months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. Contract
assets were $60.0 million and $64.3 million as of March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively.

**_Deferred Revenue_**

The Company’s deferred revenue primarily consists of payments received from customers, or such
consideration that is contractually due, in advance of providing the product or performing services. Deferred revenue
is reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. As of March 31, 2022
and June 30, 2021, the deferred revenue balance was $65.2 million and $69.0 million, respectively. For the nine
months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized revenue of $61.8 million and $75.0 million,
respectively, related to its deferred revenue.

**Remaining Performance Obligations. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance**
obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The following information
represents the total transaction price for the remaining performance obligations as of March 31, 2022 related to noncancelable contracts, including contracts less than one year in duration, that is expected to be recognized over future
periods. In each case the fiscal period represents the year ended June 30.

As of March 31, 2022, the Company had $2.6 billion of remaining performance obligations which represent
contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized. The Company expects to recognize approximately $310.0
million of the remaining performance obligations as revenue during the remainder of the fiscal year ending June 30,
2022 (“fiscal 2022”), $880.0 million for fiscal 2023, $650.0 million for fiscal 2024, $410.0 million for fiscal 2025,
$250.0 million for fiscal 2026, and $70.0 million thereafter. The remaining performance obligations exclude future
transaction revenue where revenue is recognized as the services are rendered and in the amount to which the
Company has the right to invoice.

**Costs to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract. The Company capitalizes certain contract acquisition costs consisting**
primarily of commissions incurred when contracts are signed. The Company does not capitalize commissions related
to contracts with a duration of less than one year; such commissions are expensed in selling, general and
administrative expenses when incurred. Costs to fulfill contracts are capitalized when such costs are direct and
related to transition or installation activities for hosted software solutions. Capitalized costs to fulfill contracts
primarily include travel and employee compensation and benefit related costs for the Company’s implementation
and training teams. Capitalized costs to obtain a contract and most costs to fulfill a contract are amortized over a
period of five years which represents the expected period of benefit of these costs. In instances where the contract
term is significantly less than five years, costs to fulfill are amortized over the contract term which the Company
believes best reflects the period of benefit of these costs.

As of March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, the Company capitalized contract acquisition and fulfillment costs of
$217.7 million and $195.7 million, respectively. The Company expects that incremental commission fees incurred
as a result of obtaining contracts and fulfillment costs are recoverable. During the nine months ended March 31,
2022 and 2020, the Company recognized cost amortization of $59.8 million and $54.9 million, respectively, and
there were no significant impairment losses.

The Company recognizes subscription revenue over time and substantially all transaction and other revenue at a
point in time.

**Note 7. Earnings per Share**

The numerator for basic and diluted earnings per share is net earnings attributable to CDK. The denominator for
basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of the Company’s common
stock outstanding during the applicable reporting periods. Diluted earnings per share also reflects the dilutive effect
of unexercised in-the-money stock options and unvested restricted stock.

The following table summarizes the components of earnings per share:


**Three Months Ended**

Total net earnings attributable to CDK per share 
diluted .................................................................. $ 0.56 $ 7.00 $ 1.68 $ 8.04

(1) The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock, and performance share

units is reflected in the diluted weighted average shares outstanding using the treasury stock method.

The weighted average number of shares outstanding used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share does
not include the effect of anti-dilutive securities. The potential common shares excluded were 1.5 million and 0.7

million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and 1.4 million and 1.0 million for the
nine months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

**Note 8. Allowance for Credit Losses**

Credit loss expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations. The following tables provide a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the
amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected as of March 31, 2022 and 2021.

**Note 9. Leases**

CDK as a Lessor. The Company’s hardware-as-a-service arrangements, in which the Company provides
customers continuous access to CDK owned hardware, such as networking and telephony equipment and laser
printers, are accounted for as sales-type leases under ASU N0. 2016-02 “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASC 842”),
primarily because they do not contain substantive substitution rights. Since the Company elected to not reassess
prior conclusions related to arrangements containing leases, the lease classification, and the initial direct costs, only
hardware leases that commenced or are modified on or subsequent to July 1, 2019, are accounted for under ASC
842. Historically, the Company has accounted for these arrangements as a distinct performance obligation under the
revenue recognition guidance and recognized revenue over the term of the arrangement. Sales-type lease
arrangements follow the Company’s customary contracting practices and, generally, include a fixed monthly fee for
the lease and non-lease components for the duration of the contract term. The Company does not typically provide
renewal, termination or purchase options to its customers.

The Company recognizes net investment in sales-type leases based on the present value of the lease receivable
when collectability is probable. The Company accounts for lease and non-lease components such as maintenance
costs, separately. Consideration is allocated between lease and non-lease components based on stand-alone selling
price.

The following summarizes components of net lease income reported in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations:

Less: current maturities of long
term debt and finance lease
liabilities 10.2 7.1
Total long-term debt and finance

lease liabilities .......................... $ 1,777.6 $ 1,586.5

**Credit Facility. The Company has a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “revolving credit**
facility”). The revolving credit facility provides up to $750.0 million of borrowing capacity and includes a sub-limit
of up to $100.0 million for loans in euro, pound sterling, and, if approved by the revolving lenders, other currencies.
The average outstanding balances of the revolving credit facility were $212.7 million and zero for the three months
ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $141.3 million and $58.1 million for the nine months ended
March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

**Unamortized Debt Financing Costs. Debt financing costs are amortized over the terms of the related debt**
instruments and recorded to interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

**Finance Lease Liabilities. The Company has lease agreements for equipment, which are classified as finance**
lease liabilities. Refer to Note 9 - Leases for scheduled maturities and additional information relating to finance
lease liabilities.

**Fair Value. The Company’s senior notes are considered Level 2 fair value measurements in the fair value**
hierarchy and the approximate aggregate fair value is based on quoted market prices for similar instruments. The fair
value of the revolving credit facility is equal to its carrying value as the Company has the ability to repay the
outstanding principal at par value at any time. The approximate fair values and related carrying values of the longterm debt, including current maturities and excluding unamortized debt financing costs, are as follows:


-----

**March 31, 2022** **June 30, 2021**
Fair value .................................................................................................................. $ 1,646.4 $ 1,746.8
Carrying value .......................................................................................................... 1,612.8 1,610.9

**Note 11. Income Taxes**

**Provision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense was $25.9 million and $24.1 million for the three months**
ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate, expressed by calculating the provision for
income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes, was 27.0% and 33.8% for the three months ended
March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2022 differed
from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to state and local income taxes and non-deductible
officers’ compensation. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2021 differed from the U.S.
federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to $7.0 million of tax expense for a valuation allowance on a deferred
tax asset for the future capital loss on an equity method investment that was not expected to be realized and $1.3
million tax expense for non-deductible officers’ compensation, offset by a $2.4 million tax benefit related to a prior
year.

Income tax expense was $75.1 million and $73.8 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. The effective tax rate, expressed by calculating the provision for income taxes as a percentage of
earnings before income taxes, was 26.6% and 32.4%, for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021,
respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 differed from the U.S. federal
statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to state and local income taxes and non-deductible officers’ compensation,
partially offset by a $2.0 million benefit due to the expiration of the statute of limitations related to certain transfer
pricing exposures. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2021 differed from the U.S. federal
statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to $7.0 million of tax expense for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset
for the future capital loss on an equity method investment that was not expected to be realized, $4.8 million of tax
expense from non-deductible officers’ compensation, $1.7 million of tax expense related to a prior year, and $1.4
million of tax expense from recording valuation allowances on U.S. foreign tax credits.

**Valuation Allowances. The Company had valuation allowances of $14.8 million and $13.6 million as of March**
31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively, because the Company has concluded it is more likely than not that it will
be unable to utilize certain net operating carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards, and U.S. tax credits. As of each
reporting date, the Company’s management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, which could impact
management’s view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets.

**Unrecognized Income Tax Benefits. As of March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, the Company had unrecognized**
income tax benefits of $15.7 million and $23.0 million, respectively. These amounts, when netted against offsetting
receivables, would have a net impact on tax expense of $(0.3) million and $3.9 million, respectively, if recognized.
During the nine months ended March 31, 2022, the Company primarily decreased its unrecognized income tax
benefits due to expiration of the statute of limitations. It is reasonably possible that the unrecognized income tax
benefits will provide a tax benefit of $1.0 million within the next twelve months.

**Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies**

**Legal Proceedings. From time to time, the Company is subject to various claims and is involved in various**
legal, regulatory, and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of its
business activities, including those noted in this section. Although management at present has no basis to conclude
that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will materially harm the
Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends, legal proceedings and related
government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur.
Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages. In addition, in matters for which injunctive
relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order
prohibiting the Company from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular
business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on
the Company’s business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. The Company might also


-----

conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of its stockholders, employees, and customers,
and any such settlement could include substantial payments.

**Competition Matters. The Company is currently involved in the following antitrust lawsuits that set forth**
allegations of anti-competitive agreements between the Company and The Reynolds and Reynolds Company
(“Reynolds”) relating to the manner in which the defendants control access to, and allow integration with, their
respective Dealer Management System (“DMS”), and that seek, among other things, treble damages and injunctive
relief. These lawsuits have been transferred to, or filed in, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois
for consolidated and coordinated pretrial proceedings as part of a multi-district litigation proceeding (“MDL”).

  - Teterboro Automall, Inc. d/b/a Teterboro Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram (“Teterboro”) brought a putative class
action suit on behalf of itself and all similarly situated automobile dealerships against CDK Global, LLC
and Reynolds. Teterboro’s suit was originally filed on October 19, 2017, in the U.S. District Court for the
District of New Jersey. Since that time, several more putative class actions were filed in a number of
federal district courts, with substantively similar allegations; all of them have been consolidated with the
MDL proceeding. On June 4, 2018, a consolidated class action complaint was filed on behalf of a putative
class made up of all dealerships in the United States that directly purchased DMS and/or allegedly
indirectly purchased DMS or data integration services from CDK Global, LLC or Reynolds (“Putative
Dealership Class Plaintiffs”). CDK Global, LLC moved to dismiss the complaint, or in the alternative,
compel arbitration of certain of the cases while staying the remainder pending the outcome of those
arbitration proceedings; its motion to dismiss was granted in part and denied in part, while its motion to
compel arbitration was denied. On February 22, 2019, CDK Global, LLC filed an answer to the remaining
claims in Putative Dealership Class Plaintiffs’ complaint and asserted counterclaims against the Putative
Dealership Class Plaintiffs. The Putative Dealership Class Plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss CDK Global,
LLC’s counterclaims; that motion was granted in part and denied in part on September 3, 2019. On October
23, 2018, the Putative Dealership Class Plaintiffs and Reynolds filed a motion for preliminary approval of
settlement and for conditional certification of the proposed settlement class. The court finally approved that
settlement on January 22, 2019. The parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment and Daubert motions
were fully briefed as of September 28, 2020. On January 21, 2022 the court issued a memorandum opinion
and order with respect to the Daubert motions, granting the motions in part and denying in part. The
parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment remain pending.

  - Loop LLC d/b/a AutoLoop (“AutoLoop”) brought suit against CDK Global, LLC on April 9, 2018, in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, but reserved its rights with respect to remand to the
U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin at the conclusion of the MDL proceedings. On
June 5, 2018, AutoLoop amended its complaint to sue on behalf of itself and a putative class of all other
automotive software vendors in the United States that purchased data integration services from CDK
Global, LLC or Reynolds. CDK Global, LLC moved to compel arbitration of AutoLoop’s claims, or in the
alternative, to dismiss those claims; that motion was denied on January 25, 2019. CDK Global, LLC filed
an answer to AutoLoop’s complaint and asserted counterclaims against AutoLoop on February 15, 2019.
AutoLoop filed an answer to CDK Global, LLC’s counterclaims on March 8, 2019. The parties’ crossmotions for summary judgment and Daubert motions were fully briefed as of September 28, 2020. On
January 21, 2022 the court issued a memorandum opinion and order with respect to the Daubert motions,
granting the motions in part and denying in part. The parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment remain
pending.

The Company believes that the remaining unsettled cases are without merit and will continue to vigorously
contest all asserted claims. Nonetheless, in light of the Company’s settlements with Authenticom, i3 Brands, MVSC,
and Cox and its continued expenditure of legal costs to contest the remaining claims, the Company has determined
that a loss of some measure is probable and can be reasonably estimated. As of March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021,
the litigation liability for the remaining unsettled cases was $34.0 million and $34.0 million, respectively. This
estimated loss is based upon currently available information and represents the Company’s best estimate of such
loss. Estimating the value of this estimated loss involved significant judgment given the uncertainty that still exists
with respect to the remaining unsettled cases due to a variety of factors typical of complex, large scale litigation,
including, among others: (i) formative issues, including: (a) the causes of action the plaintiffs can pursue; (b) the
definition of the class(es) of plaintiffs; (c) the types of damages that can be recovered; and (d) whether plaintiffs can


-----

establish loss causation as a matter of law, all of which have yet to be determined pending the outcome of
dispositive motions (e.g., motions for class certification and motions for summary judgment); (ii) significant factual
issues remain to be resolved; (iii) expert perspectives with respect to, among other things, alleged antitrust injury
and damages is widely divergent and remains subject to dispositive motions; (iv) the absence of productive
settlement discussions to date with the remaining plaintiffs; and (v) the novel or uncertain nature of the legal issues
presented. For these same reasons, the Company cannot reasonably estimate a maximum potential loss exposure at
this time. In addition, the Company’s estimate does not incorporate or reflect the potential value of the Company’s
counterclaims against certain of the plaintiffs in the ongoing cases. The legal proceedings underlying the estimated
litigation liability will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from the estimate. As
noted above, an adverse result in any of the remaining cases could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.

On June 22, 2017, the Company received from the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) a Civil Investigative
Demand consisting of specifications calling for the production of documents relating to any agreements between the
Company and Reynolds. Parallel document requests have been received from certain states’ Attorneys General.
Since 2017, the Company has engaged in continuing communication with and received subsequent requests from the
FTC related to its investigation. The Company has responded to the requests and no proceedings have been
instituted. The Company believes there has not been any conduct by the Company or its current or former
employees that would be actionable under the antitrust laws in connection with the agreements between the
Company and Reynolds or otherwise. At this time, the Company does not have sufficient information to predict the
outcome of, or the cost of responding to or resolving, these investigations.

Other Commitments and Contingencies. In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into
contracts in which the Company makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the
Company’s services and products. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations
and warranties.

The Company has provided approximately $28.1 million of guarantees as of March 31, 2022 in the form of
surety bonds issued to support certain licenses and contracts which require a surety bond as a guarantee of
performance of contractual obligations. In general, the Company would only be liable for the amount of these
guarantees in the event the Company defaulted in performing the obligations under each contract, of which, the
probability is remote.

The Company had a total of $1.8 million in letters of credit outstanding as of March 31, 2022 primarily in
connection with insurance programs.

**Note 13. Subsequent Events**

On April 7, 2022, the Company entered into a merger agreement to be acquired by Brookfield Business
Partners, together with institutional partners (collectively “Brookfield”). Pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement, on April 22, 2022, an affiliate of Brookfield commenced a tender offer (the “Offer”) to acquire all of the
outstanding shares of common stock of the Company at a per share price of $54.87 in cash. The merger agreement
includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants of the parties, including termination provisions for
both the Company and Brookfield and a mutual termination right if the Offer has not been consummated on or
before October 7, 2022. The closing of the Offer will be subject to certain conditions, including the tender of shares
representing at least a majority of the total number of the CDK’s outstanding shares and other customary conditions.
Under the merger agreement, the Company may be required to pay Brookfield a termination fee of $181.5 million if
the agreement is terminated under specified circumstances. The merger agreement additionally provides that
Brookfield may be required to pay the Company a termination fee of $594.0 million under specified circumstances.
Following the consummation of the Offer, the remaining shares of common stock of the Company (other than as set
forth in the merger agreement) will be acquired through a second-step merger. The transaction is expected to close
in the third quarter of calendar year 2022.

On April 20, 2022, the Company commenced tender offers to purchase for cash any and all of its issued and
outstanding senior notes and related solicitations of consents to the adoption of certain proposed amendments. The
consummation of these tender offers for the senior notes and related consent solicitations is not a condition to the
consummation of the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company.

**REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM**

To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of
CDK Global, Inc.
Hoffman Estates, Illinois

**Opinion on the Financial Statements**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CDK Global, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive
income, stockholders’ (deficit) equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2021,
and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2021, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**Changes in Accounting Principle**

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, effective July 1, 2019, the Company adopted the Financial
Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 842, Leases, using the modified retrospective
approach.

**Basis for Opinion**

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

**Critical Audit Matter**

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial
statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,
providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

**Revenue — Refer to Notes 2 and 6 to the financial statements**

_Critical Audit Matter Description_

The Company generates revenue from the following four categories: subscription, on-site licenses and
installation, transaction, and other. The majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from contracts with
multiple performance obligations, and the Company’s products and services are rarely licensed or sold on a
standalone basis. Due to the multiple element nature of the Company’s contracts, appropriate revenue recognition
requires the Company to exercise significant judgment in the following areas:


-----

  - Determination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should
be accounted for separately versus together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold in
hosted service arrangements.

  - Determination of stand-alone selling prices for products and services.

  - Estimation of contract transaction price and allocation of the transaction price to identified performance
obligations.

  - The pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance
obligation.

In addition, the Company’s subscription and on-site license and installation revenue consists of a significant
volume of transactions, sourced from multiple systems, databases, and other tools across different business entities.
The processing and recording of revenue involves a combination of manual-intensive data input and automation,
including migrating, formatting, and combining significant volumes of data across multiple systems and interfaces,
partially facilitated by custom-built algorithms.

Given the complexity of certain of the Company’s contracts and judgments necessary to evaluate the revenue
recognition considerations as noted above, the volume of contracts, and the complex manual and automated
processes to record revenue, performing procedures to audit revenue required a high degree of auditor judgment and
extensive audit effort, including involvement of professionals with expertise in information technology (IT).

_How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit_

Our audit procedures related to the Company’s accounting for contracts with customers included the following,
among others:

  - We tested the effectiveness of controls over the review of customer contracts, including, among others the
identification of performance obligations, determination of stand-alone selling prices, estimating
transaction price, and determination of pattern of delivery of performance obligations.

  - With the assistance of our IT specialists, we:

    - Identified the significant systems used to process revenue transactions and tested the general IT
controls over each of these systems, including testing of user access controls, change management
controls, and IT operations controls.

    - Performed testing of system interface controls and automated controls within the relevant revenue
streams, as well as the controls designed to determine the accuracy and completeness of revenue.

  - We selected a sample of customer contracts and performed the following, among others:

    - Obtained contract documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other documents
that were part of the agreement.

    - Analyzed the contract to determine if arrangement terms that may have an impact on revenue
recognition were identified and properly considered in the evaluation of the accounting for the
contract.

    - Confirmed the contract terms with the counterparty and performed alternative procedures in the event
of nonreplies.

    - Tested management’s identification of distinct performance obligations by evaluating whether the
underlying goods, services, or both were highly interdependent and interrelated.


-----

    - Evaluated the total transaction price determined by management based on the terms of the contract,
including any variable consideration, and recalculated the allocation of the total transaction price to
each distinct performance obligation based on respective standalone selling prices.

    - Evaluated the appropriateness of the selected pattern of revenue recognition for each performance
obligation and tested delivery/installation of the goods and services.

    - For a sample of revenue transactions, we performed detail transaction testing by agreeing the amounts
recognized to source documents and testing the mathematical accuracy of the recorded revenue.

  - We analyzed trends in revenue at the customer and product/service levels to identify unusual trends,
patterns, or anomalies.

  - We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s methodology for estimating standalone selling prices.

**CDK Global, Inc.**
**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements**
**(Tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)**

**Note 1. Basis of Presentation**

Description of Business. CDK Global, Inc. (the “Company” or “CDK”) is a leading provider of integrated data
and technology solutions to the automotive, heavy truck, recreation and heavy equipment industries. Focused on
enabling end-to-end, omnichannel retail commerce through open, agnostic technology, the Company provides
solutions to dealers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), serving approximately 15,000 retail locations
in North America. The Company’s solutions connect people with technology by automating and integrating all parts
of the dealership and buying process, including the acquisition, sale, financing, insuring, parts supply, repair and
maintenance of vehicles.

Basis of Preparation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and the rules and
regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The preparation of the financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect assets, liabilities,
revenue, and expenses that are reported in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual
results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.

On March 1, 2021, the Company completed the sale of the CDK International business (“International
Business”) to Francisco Partners. Following the sale of the International Business, the Company is organized as a
single operating segment. The assets and liabilities of the International Business were classified as held for sale on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2020. The financial results of the International Business are
presented in net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all
periods presented. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Unless otherwise noted, discussion in these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements refers to continuing
operations. For additional information, refer to Note 4 - Discontinued Operations.

Effective July 1, 2020, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting
Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of
Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (“ASU 2016-13”). The comparative information has not been restated and
continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the periods presented. For additional
information, refer to Note 11 - Allowance for Credit Losses.

**Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

**Consolidation. The financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned**
subsidiaries. In addition, the financial statements include the accounts of Computerized Vehicle Registration
(“CVR”) in which CDK holds a controlling financial interest. Intercompany transactions and balances between
consolidated CDK businesses have been eliminated.

**Business Combinations. The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of**
accounting, which allocates the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired
and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair
values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions. The Company may
utilize third-party valuation specialists to assist the Company in the purchase price allocation. Initial purchase price
allocations are subject to revision within the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of
acquisition. Acquisition-related transaction and other costs associated with business combinations are expensed as
incurred.

**Restructuring. Restructuring expenses include employee-related costs, including severance and other**
termination benefits calculated based on long-standing benefit practices and local statutory requirements.
Restructuring liabilities are recognized at fair value in the period the liability is incurred. In some jurisdictions, the


-----

Company has ongoing benefit arrangements under which the Company records estimated severance and other
termination benefits when such costs are deemed probable and estimable, approved by the appropriate corporate
management, and if actions required to complete the termination plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant
changes to the plan will be made or the plan will be withdrawn. In jurisdictions where there is not an ongoing
benefit arrangement, the Company records estimated severance and other termination benefits when appropriate
corporate management has committed to the plan and the benefit arrangement is communicated to the affected
employees. Restructuring expenses may also include contract termination costs. A liability for costs to terminate a
contract before the end of its term is recognized at fair value when the Company terminates the contract in
accordance with its terms. Estimates are evaluated periodically to determine whether an adjustment is required.

**Revenue Recognition. The Company determines the amount of revenue to be recognized through the following**
steps:

  - Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;

  - Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;

  - Determination of the transaction price;

  - Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

  - Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies the performance obligations.

The majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from contracts with multiple performance obligations. A
performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account
in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct
performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The
Company is required to estimate the total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers. In
limited circumstances, the consideration expected to be received may be variable based on the specific terms of the
contract.

The Company rarely licenses or sells products or services on a standalone basis. As such, the Company is
required to develop its best estimate of standalone selling price of each distinct good or service as the basis for
allocating the total transaction price. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the adjusted
market assessment approach, with some product categories using the expected cost plus a margin approach. When
establishing standalone selling price, the Company considers various factors which may include geographic region,
current market trends, customer class, its market share and position, its general pricing practices for bundled
products and services, and recent contract sales data.

The Company applies significant judgment in order to identify and determine the number of performance
obligations, estimate the total transaction price, determine the allocation of the transaction price to each identified
performance obligation, and determine the appropriate method and timing of revenue recognition.

Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis; that is,
such taxes are excluded from revenue.

The Company generates revenue from the following four categories: subscription, on-site licenses and
installation, transaction, and other. The Company does not evaluate a contract for a significant financing component
if payment is expected within one year from the transfer of the promised items to the customer.

**_Subscription. CDK provides software and technology solutions for automotive retailers and OEMs, which_**
includes:

  - Dealer Management Systems (“DMSs”) and layered applications, which may be installed on-site at the
customer’s location, or hosted and provided on a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) basis, including ongoing
maintenance and support;


-----

  - Interrelated services such as installation, initial training, and data updates;

  - Prior to adoption of ASC 842 “Leases” (“ASC 842”), subscription revenue included technology solutions
in which hardware was provided on a service basis. This revenue was previously classified as subscription
revenue because, under lease accounting guidance in effect prior to ASC 842, substitution rights were
considered substantive.

SaaS and other hosted service arrangements, which allow the customer continuous access to the software over
the contract period without taking control of the software, are provided on a subscription basis. The Company has
concluded that under its SaaS and hosted service arrangements, the customer obtains access to the Company’s
software which resides and is maintained on its managed servers. The customer does not obtain the right to take
possession of the software. As such, the Company has concluded that its SaaS and hosted services arrangements do
not include a software license. Furthermore, the Company has concluded that while the support and maintenance
and hosting services are capable of being distinct performance obligations, the obligations are not distinct within the
context of the contract. In addition, as the support and maintenance and hosting services are provided over the same
period and have the same pattern of transfer of control, the support and maintenance and hosting services are
combined and recognized as a single performance obligation. The Company may provide new customers with
interrelated setup activities such as installation, initial training and data updates that the Company must undertake to
fulfill the contract. These are considered fulfillment activities that do not transfer service to the customer. In addition
to the core DMS software application, the customer may also contract for layered applications, which are each
considered a distinct performance obligation.

Revenue for SaaS and other hosted service arrangements, are recognized ratably over the duration of the
contract. The Company has determined its obligation under these arrangements is to stand ready to perform the
underlying services as required by the customer. The customer receives the benefit of the services, and the Company
has the right to payment as the services are performed. A time-elapsed output method is used to measure progress as
the Company transfers control evenly over the duration of the contract.

**_On-site licenses and installation. On-site software arrangements include a license of intellectual property as the_**
customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software and the customer can either run the software on
its own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to the Company to host the software. The customer
receives the right to use the software license upon its installation for the term of the arrangement. As such, the
Company has concluded that the software license is a distinct performance obligation and recognizes the transaction
price allocated to on-site software upon installation. The Company also provides maintenance and support of the
software applications. Such maintenance and support services may include server and desktop support, bug fixes,
and support resolving other issues a customer may encounter in utilizing the software. Revenue allocated to
maintenance and support is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously
consume and receive benefits, given the support and maintenance comprise distinct performance obligations that are
satisfied ratably over time. A time-elapsed output method is used to measure progress as the Company transfers
control evenly over the duration of the contract. Accordingly, maintenance and support revenue for on-site licenses
is included in subscription revenue.

**_Transaction. The Company receives fees per transaction for providing auto retailers interfaces with third parties_**
to process credit reports, vehicle registrations, and automotive equity mining. Transaction revenue varies based on
the volume of transactions processed. For transaction revenue, the Company has a right to payment as the
transactions are performed in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer. As such, the
Company recognizes transaction revenue as the services are rendered and in the amount to which it has the right to
invoice. Transaction revenue for credit report processing and automotive equity mining is recorded in revenue on a
gross basis, incurred when the Company is substantively and contractually responsible for providing the service,
software, and/or connectivity to the customer, and controls the specified good or service before it is transferred to
the customer. The Company recognizes vehicle registration revenue net of the state registration fee since it is acting
as an agent and does not control the related goods and services before they are transferred to the customer.

**_Other. The Company provides consulting and professional services, including marketing campaign solutions,_**
and sells hardware such as laser printers, networking and telephony equipment, and related items. Consulting and
professional services are either billed on a time and materials basis or on a fixed monthly, quarterly or semi-annual
basis based on the amount of services contracted. Revenue from these services is recorded when the Company’s


-----

obligation is satisfied. Where the Company’s obligation is to provide continuous services throughout the contract
period and the customer receives the benefit of those services as they are performed, the Company recognizes
services revenue over time using a time-elapsed output method as the Company believes the passage of time
faithfully depicts the transfer of services to its customers. Where the professional service represents a single
performance obligation, the customer receives the benefit of the services only upon their completion, and the
Company does not have the right to payment as the services are performed, such services revenue is recognized
upon completion.

The Company often sells hardware bundled with maintenance services and has concluded that these bundles
include two distinct performance obligations. The first performance obligation is to transfer the hardware product
and the second performance obligation is to provide maintenance on the hardware and its embedded software. As
such, the transaction price allocated to the sold hardware is recognized upon delivery at which point the customer is
able to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the hardware. Upon delivery of the
hardware, the Company generally has the right to payment, the customer has legal title, physical possession of, and
control of the hardware. The transaction price allocated to the maintenance of hardware and its embedded software
is recognized ratably over the duration of the contract as the customer simultaneously consumes and receives the
benefit of this maintenance. The Company has determined its obligation under these arrangements is to stand ready
to perform the underlying services as required by the customer. A time-elapsed output method is used to measure
progress as the Company transfers control evenly over the duration of the contract. Hardware maintenance is
included in subscription revenue.

After the adoption of ASC 842, Other revenue also includes leasing revenue from hardware where the customer
has a right of use during the contract term under ASC 842, as hardware substitution rights are not considered
substantive.

**Income Taxes. Income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current**
year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax
credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments, and estimates to determine the provision for
income taxes, taxes payable or refundable, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company’s assumptions,
judgments, and estimates take into consideration the realization of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws or
interpretations thereof. The Company’s income tax returns are subject to examination by various tax authorities. A
change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than
not to be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers future market growth,
forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event the
Company determines that it is more likely than not that an entity will be unable to realize all or a portion of its
deferred tax assets in the future, the Company would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a
corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which such a determination is made. Likewise, if the Company
later determines that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, the Company would
reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance. In order to realize deferred tax
assets, the Company must be able to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the
jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.

The Company recognizes tax benefits for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon
examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater
than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits are tax benefits claimed in
the Company’s income tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards. Assumptions,
judgments, and the use of estimates are required in determining whether the “more likely than not” standard has
been met when developing the provision for income taxes.

If certain pending tax matters settle within one year, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase
or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to
significant uncertainty. The Company continually assesses the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and


-----

adjusts the income tax provision, the current taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that
give rise to a revision become known.

The Company accounts for the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) tax as a period expense when
incurred. The GILTI provision is effective beginning in fiscal 2019.

Beginning in fiscal 2019, accounting policy of the Company is to allocate goodwill impairment first to any
permanent portion of goodwill (when there is an excess of book goodwill over tax goodwill) and to record a period
cost when the impairment occurs.

**Stock-Based Compensation. Certain of the Company’s employees have been granted (a) stock options to**
purchase shares of the Company’s common stock and/or (b) restricted stock or restricted stock units under which
shares of the Company’s common stock vest based on the passage of time or achievement of performance and
market conditions. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense in net earnings based on the fair
value of the award on the date of the grant. The Company records the impact of forfeitures on stock compensation
expense in the period the forfeitures occur. The Company determines the fair value of stock options issued using a
binomial option-pricing model. The binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to
volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatility utilized in the
binomial option pricing model is based on a combination of implied market volatility and historical volatility of peer
companies. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future dividend payments.
The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option
pricing model also incorporates exercises based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of a stock option
grant is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are
expected to be outstanding.

The grant date fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units that vest upon achievement of service
conditions is based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company also
grants performance-based awards that vest over a performance period. Certain performance-based awards are further
subject to adjustment (increase or decrease) based on a market condition defined as total stockholder return of the
Company’s common stock compared to a peer group of companies. The fair value of performance-based awards
subject to a market condition is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The principal variable
assumptions utilized in determining the grant date fair value of performance-based awards subject to a market
condition include the risk-free rate, stock volatility, dividend yield, and correlations between the Company’s stock
price and the stock prices of the peer group of companies. The probability associated with the achievement of
performance conditions affects the vesting of the Company’s performance-based awards. Expense is only
recognized for those shares expected to vest. The Company adjusts stock-based compensation expense (increase or
decrease) when it becomes probable that actual performance will differ from the estimate.

**Cash and Cash Equivalents. Investment securities with an original maturity of three months or less at the time**
of purchase are considered cash equivalents.

**Accounts Receivable, Net. Accounts receivable, net is primarily comprised of trade receivables and lease**
receivables, net of allowances. Trade receivables consist of amounts due to the Company in the normal course of
business, which are not collateralized and do not bear interest. Lease receivables primarily relate to sales-type leases
arising from the sale of hardware elements in bundled DMS or other integrated solutions. Lease receivables
represent the current portion of the present value of the minimum lease payments at the beginning of the lease term.
The long-term portion of the present value of the minimum lease payments is included in other assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

**Allowance for Credit Losses. The Company is exposed to credit losses primarily through the sales of its**
products and services. The majority of the Company’s receivables are trade receivables due in less than one year.
The Company’s receivables also include the short and long-term portions of contract assets, lease receivables and
other accrued and unbilled receivables. Refer to Note 6 - Revenue for more information about contract assets.

After the adoption of ASU 2016-13, which requires the application of a current expected credit loss impairment
model (“CECL”), the Company identified the following risk characteristics of its customers and the related
receivables and financial assets: geographic region, major line of business (e.g. Automotive, OEM, etc.), size or a


-----

combination of these characteristics. Receivables with similar risk characteristics have been grouped into pools. For
each pool, the Company considers the historical credit loss experience, current economic conditions, adjusted for
external data and macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates in certain operating regions or automobile
sales. Due to the short-term nature of trade receivables, the estimated amount of accounts receivable that may not be
collected is based on the aging of the receivable balances, the financial condition of customers and the Company’s
historical loss rates. For certain other financial assets, the expected credit losses are also evaluated based on the
credit rating of the counterparty, or reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.
Additionally, specific reserves are established for certain financial assets on an individual basis when they no longer
meet the criteria to be classified in a particular pool. Should a particular asset’s risk characteristics change, the
Company will assess whether the asset should be moved to another pool. This analysis and the review of credit
quality indicators are performed at each quarter-end, or more often as deemed necessary based on specific facts and
circumstances.

The Company also carries financial assets that are attributable to the sale of the Digital Marketing Business and
the International Business. These assets primarily consist of a 10-year note receivable, receivables related to
transition services agreements in connection with the sale of the businesses, and the fair value of contingent
consideration. Specific reserves are established for these assets if it is determined that there is a higher probability of
default, which considers the aging of the receivable balances and the financial condition of the counterparties.

The Company’s monitoring activities include timely account reconciliation, reviews of credit and collection
performance, consideration of customers’ financial conditions and macroeconomic conditions. For trade receivables
and unbilled accounts receivable, credit quality indicators relate to collection history and the delinquency status of
amounts due, which is determined based on the aging of such receivables. For certain other financial assets
including contract assets, lease receivables, other accrued and unbilled receivables, and financial assets attributable
to the sale of the Digital Marketing Business and the International Business, credit quality indicators are generally
based on rating agency data, publicly available information and information provided by customers which may
affect their ability to pay. Financial assets are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible.

Prior to the adoption of CECL, the accounts receivable allowances for both trade receivables and lease
receivables were estimated based on historical collection experience, an analysis of the age of outstanding accounts
receivable, and credit issuance experience. Receivables were considered past due if payment was not received by the
date agreed upon with the customers. Write-offs were made when management believed it was probable a receivable
would not be recovered.

**Funds Receivable and Funds Held for Clients and Client Fund Obligations. Funds receivable and funds**
held for clients represent amounts received or expected to be received from clients in advance of performing titling
and registration services on behalf of those clients. These funds are restricted and classified in other current assets on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The total amount due to remit for titling and registration obligations with the
Department of Motor Vehicles is recorded to client fund obligations which is classified as accrued expenses and
other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Funds receivable was $42.7 million and $40.7 million,
and funds held for clients was $20.2 million and $16.5 million as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Client
fund obligation was $62.9 million and $57.2 million as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

**Property, Plant and Equipment, Net. Property, plant and equipment, net is stated at cost and depreciated over**
the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. The estimated useful lives of
assets are primarily as follows:

Buildings .................................................................................................................................... 20 to 40 years
Furniture and fixtures ................................................................................................................. 4 to 7 years
Data processing equipment ......................................................................................................... 2 to 5 years

**Goodwill. The Company performs an evaluation of goodwill, utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative**
impairment test. A qualitative assessment is performed at least annually to determine whether it is more likely than
not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The Company performs a quantitative
impairment test for each reporting unit every three years, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential
impairment. The annual test for impairment is conducted as of April 1. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a


-----

component of an operating segment. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at
the reporting unit level.

Under a qualitative assessment, the most recent quantitative assessment is used to determine if it is more likely
than not that the reporting unit’s goodwill is impaired. As part of this qualitative assessment, the Company assesses
relevant events and circumstances including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost
factors, overall financial performance, changes in share price and entity-specific events to determine if there is an
indication of impairment.

Under a quantitative assessment, goodwill impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting
unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,
goodwill is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to
exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The fair value of a reporting unit is generally determined by using a
weighted combination of an income approach and a market approach, as this combination is considered the most
indicative of the Company’s fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. The Company
currently applies a 100% income approach weighting to one of its reporting units due to the limited publicly
available information for guideline companies.

Under the income approach, the Company determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows of a
reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of
inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. The estimated future
cash flows of each reporting unit are based on internally generated forecasts for the remainder of the respective
reporting period and the next five to ten years.

Under the market approach, the Company utilizes valuation multiples derived from publicly available
information for guideline companies to provide an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the
marketplace would be willing to pay for a company. The valuation multiples are applied to the reporting units.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant
estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and future market
conditions, among others. Any changes in the judgments, estimates or assumptions used could produce significantly
different results.

**Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or**
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of
assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated
undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset
exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying
amount exceeds the fair value.

**Internal Use Software and Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. The**
Company’s policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with
developing or obtaining internal use computer software. In addition, the Company’s policy also provides for the
capitalization of certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use
computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to
the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training,
maintenance, and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. The Company also
expenses internal costs related to minor upgrades and enhancements, as it is impracticable to separate these costs
from normal maintenance activities. The Company typically amortizes internal use software over a 3 to 8 years life.

The Company’s policy provides for the capitalization of certain costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or
otherwise marketed. The Company capitalizes software production costs upon reaching technological feasibility for
a specific product. Technological feasibility is attained when software products have a completed working model
whose consistency with the overall product design has been confirmed by testing. Costs incurred prior to the
establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. The establishment of technological feasibility
requires judgment by management and in many instances is only attained a short time prior to the general release of
the software. Maintenance-related costs are expensed as incurred.


-----

Pursuant to these policies, the Company incurred expenses to research, develop, and deploy new and enhanced
solutions of $79.3 million, $49.6 million, and $57.6 million for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. These
expenses were classified in cost of revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

**Assets Held for Sale. The Company considers assets to be held for sale when management, with appropriate**
authority, approves and commits to a formal plan to actively market the assets for sale at a price reasonable in
relation to their estimated fair value, the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition, an active
program to locate a buyer has been initiated, the sale of the assets is probable and expected to be completed in one
year and it is unlikely that significant changes will be made to the plan. Upon designation as held for sale, the
Company records the assets at the lower of their carrying value or their estimated fair value, reduced for the cost to
dispose the assets, and ceases to record depreciation and amortization expenses on the assets.

Assets and liabilities of a discontinued operation are reclassified for all comparative periods presented on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. For assets and liabilities that meet the held for sale criteria but do not meet the
definition of a discontinued operation, the Company reclassifies the assets and liabilities in the period in which the
held for sale criteria are met, but does not reclassify prior period amounts. Refer to Note 4 - Discontinued
Operations for further information regarding Company’s assets and liabilities held for sale.

**Discontinued Operations. The Company reports financial results for discontinued operations separately from**
continuing operations to distinguish the financial impact of disposal transactions from ongoing operations.
Discontinued operations reporting occurs only when the disposal of a component or a group of components of the
Company (i) meets the held-for-sale classification criteria, is disposed of by sale, or other than by sale, and (ii)
represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results. The
results of operations and cash flows of a discontinued operation are restated for all comparative periods presented.
Unless otherwise noted, discussion in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements refers to the Company’s
continuing operations. Refer to Note 4 - Discontinued Operations for further information.

**Fair Value Measurements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or**
paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair
value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. A fair value
hierarchy has been established based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and
the last unobservable.

  - Level 1: Inputs that are based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

  - Level 2: Inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, which are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly.

  - Level 3: Unobservable inputs where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability. These
inputs reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use to price the assets or
liabilities at the measurement date.

The Company determines the fair value of financial instruments in accordance with ASC 820, “Fair Value
Measurements.” This standard defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance
with GAAP. Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, and other
current liabilities are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at cost, which approximates fair value due to the
short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of the Company’s term loan facilities (as described in
Note 16 - Debt), including accrued interest, approximated fair value based on the Company’s current estimated
incremental borrowing rate for similar types of arrangements.

The Company has derivatives not designated as hedges which consisted of foreign currency forward contracts
to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposure on intercompany loans. The
Company recognized changes in fair value of the derivative instruments in other income, net in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.


-----

**Foreign Currency. For foreign subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, net assets are**
translated into U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect for each period, and revenue and expenses are
translated at average exchange rates in the periods. Gains or losses from balance sheet translation of such entities are
included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Currency transaction
gains or losses relate to intercompany loans denominated in a currency other than that of the loan counterparty,
which do not eliminate upon consolidation. Currency transaction gains or losses are included in other income, net on
the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

**Leases. The Company has lease arrangements where the Company acts as either a lessee or a lessor. The**
Company applies judgment in order to determine if an arrangement contains a lease, to assess which party retains a
material amount of economic benefit from the underlying asset, and to determine which party holds control over the
direction and use of the asset. The Company also applies judgment to determine whether the Company will exercise
renewal options, to identify substantive substitution rights over the asset, to determine the incremental borrowing
rate, and to estimate the fair value of the leased asset.

**CDK as a Lessee. The Company has obligations under lease arrangements mainly for facilities, equipment,**
data centers, and vehicles. These leases have original lease periods expiring between fiscal 2022 and 2027. The
Company classifies leases as finance leases when there is either a transfer of ownership of the underlying asset by
the end of the lease term, the lease contains an option to purchase the asset that the Company is reasonably certain
will be exercised, the lease term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the asset, the present value of
the lease payments and any residual value guarantee equals or substantially exceeds all the fair value of the asset, or
the asset is of such a specialized nature that it will have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term.
When none of these criteria are met, the Company classifies leases as operating leases.

Several of the Company’s leases include one or more options to renew. The Company does not assume renewal
periods in its determination of lease term unless it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the renewal
option. The Company considers leases with an initial term of 12 months or less as short-term in nature and does not
record such leases on the balance sheets. The Company records all other leases on the balance sheets with right-ofuse (“ROU”) assets representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities
representing the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.

The Company recognizes ROU assets and lease liabilities based on the present value of lease payments over the
lease term. The ROU asset is adjusted for prepaid or deferred rent, lease incentives and impairments. The Company
uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of the lease
payments as the implicit rate in the leases is generally not readily determinable. The incremental borrowing rate is
generally determined using factors such as treasury yields, the Company’s credit rating and lease term, and may
differ for individual leases.

In addition to fixed lease payments, several lease arrangements contain provisions for variable lease payments
relating to utilities and maintenance costs or rental increases not scheduled in the lease. Variable lease payments are
expensed in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. The Company has elected to combine
lease and non-lease components, such as fixed maintenance costs, as a single lease component in calculating ROU
assets and lease liabilities.

**CDK as a Lessor. The Company’s hardware-as-a-service arrangements, in which the Company provides**
customers continuous access to CDK owned hardware, such as networking and telephony equipment and laser
printers, are accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842, primarily because they do not contain substantive
substitution rights. Since the Company elected to not reassess prior conclusions related to arrangements containing
leases, the lease classification, and the initial direct costs, only hardware leases that commenced or are modified on
or subsequent to July 1, 2019, are accounted for under ASC 842. Historically, the Company has accounted for these
arrangements as a distinct performance obligation under the revenue recognition guidance and recognized revenue
over the term of the arrangement. Sales-type lease arrangements follow the Company’s customary contracting
practices and, generally, include a fixed monthly fee for the lease and non-lease components for the duration of the
contract term. The Company does not typically provide renewal, termination or purchase options to its customers.

The Company recognizes net investment in sales-type leases based on the present value of the lease receivable
when collectability is probable. The Company accounts for lease and non-lease components such as maintenance


-----

costs, separately. Consideration is allocated between lease and non-lease components based on stand-alone selling
price in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

**Note 3. New Accounting Pronouncements**

**Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on July 1, 2020. Refer**
to Note 11 - Allowance for Credit Losses, for the required disclosures related to the adoption of this standard.

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), Facilitation of the
Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting” (“ASU 2020-04”). This ASU provides optional guidance
for a limited period of time to ease the burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform
on financial reporting. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848),
Scope” (“ASU 2021-01”), which expands the scope of Topic 848 to include derivative instruments impacted by
discounting transition. These ASUs would apply to companies meeting certain criteria that have contracts,
derivatives, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to
be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. These standards are effective upon issuance and may be
applied retrospectively as of any date from the beginning interim period that includes March 12, 2020 or
prospectively. The Company adopted ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 with no material impact on the consolidated
financial statements.

**Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12,**
“Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,” (“ASU 2019-12”), which simplifies the
accounting for income taxes in various areas. ASU 2019-12 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods therein. Early adoption of the standard is permitted,
including adoption in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The
Company adopted ASU 2019-12 on July 1, 2021. The adoption of the new standard will not have a material impact
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In July 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-05 “Leases (Topic 842): Lessors — Certain Leases with Variable
Lease Payments,” (“ASU 2021-05”), which modifies ASC 842 to require lessors to classify leases as operating
leases if they have variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate and would have selling losses if
they were classified as sales-type or direct financing leases. The amendments in ASU 2021-05 are effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

**Note 4. Discontinued Operations**

**International Business. On March 1, 2021, the Company completed its sale of the International Business to**
Francisco Partners for $1.5 billion in cash. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $967.7 million in fiscal
2021. The gain on sale remains subject to post-closing adjustments. The pre-tax gain on sale includes a $37.9
million reclassification of net currency losses from accumulated other comprehensive income. The pre-tax gain on
sale excludes transaction costs of $32.4 million, which were recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses
in the table below. The assets and liabilities of the International Business were classified as held for sale on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2020. The financial results are presented in net earnings (loss) from
discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. The Company
expects to provide limited services to Francisco Partners to assist in the integration of the International Business
through early fiscal 2022.

**Digital Marketing Business. On April 21, 2020, the Company completed its sale of the Digital Marketing**
Business to Sincro LLC, a newly formed company owned by Ansira Partners, Inc., (“Ansira”), which is a subsidiary
of Advent International. Total consideration for the transaction was $71.2 million, consisting of a $24.4 million 10year note receivable, a 15% equity interest in Ansira, and the fair value of other contingent consideration. The
Company recorded a total loss on sale of $94.4 million, of which $96.3 million was recorded in fiscal 2020.
Pursuant to the transaction, the Company continued to provide limited services through the third quarter of fiscal
2021.

During fiscal 2019, as a result of the Company’s decision to sell the Digital Marketing business, the Company
evaluated the reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment, which indicated that the carrying value was higher than its
fair value. The decline in fair value was driven by a decrease in estimated future earnings and an unfavorable change
in the discount rate representing management’s assessment of increased risk with respect to the business forecasts
primarily due to business uncertainty after the public announcement of the planned sale of business and
management’s shift in focus to customer retention instead of growth. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill
impairment charge of $168.7 million which is included as a component of discontinued operations for the year
ended June 30, 2019.

**Note 5. Acquisitions**

**_Fiscal 2021 Acquisitions_**

**Roadster. On June 2, 2021, the Company acquired Roadster, Inc., (“Roadster”), a Palo Alto, California-based**
digital sales platform. Roadster’s customer relationship management (“CRM”) solution enables dealers and OEMs
to sell vehicles completely online, and to enhance the consumer retail experience. The Company acquired all of the
outstanding equity of Roadster. The acquisition is being recorded using the acquisition method of accounting, which
requires, among other things, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their respective fair
values as of the acquisition date. Under the acquisition method, total consideration was determined to be $364.4
million, subject to customary adjustments. Total consideration includes the fair value of contingent payments up to
$14.5 million, for which the amount payable will vary depending on the occurrence of certain events over an 18month period after the closing.

The following table summarizes the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the
acquisition date, subject to the finalized purchase price allocation:

Cash and cash equivalents ..................................................................................................................... $ 8.5
Intangible assets .................................................................................................................................... 74.8
Other assets............................................................................................................................................ 8.2
Other liabilities ...................................................................................................................................... (10.3)
Total identifiable net assets ................................................................................................................... $ 81.2
Goodwill ................................................................................................................................................ 283.2

Total consideration ................................................................................................................................ $ 364.4

The intangible assets acquired primarily relate to customer relationships, software, and trademarks, which are
being amortized over a useful life of 10, 8 and 4 years, respectively. The weighted average useful life of the acquired
intangible assets is 8 years. The goodwill resulting from this acquisition reflects expected synergies resulting from
adding Roadster products and processes to the Company’s products and processes. The acquired goodwill is not
deductible for tax purposes.

**Square Root. On February 1, 2021, the Company acquired Square Root, Inc. (“Square Root”), an Austin-based**
developer of data curation software for OEMs. The Company acquired all of the outstanding equity of Square Root
for a purchase price of up to $25.0 million. The purchase price includes a contingent purchase price payment of up


-----

to $5.0 million, which becomes payable if certain performance conditions are met by Square Root over a two-year
period after the closing. The fair value of the contingent payments was $2.3 million as of June 30, 2021.

The results of operations for Roadster and Square Root have been included in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations from the date of acquisition. The pro forma effects of this acquisition are not significant to the
Company’s reported results for any period presented. Accordingly, no pro forma financial statements have been
presented herein.

**_Fiscal 2019 Acquisition_**

**ELEAD1ONE. On September 14, 2018, the Company acquired the equity interests of ELEAD1ONE**
(“ELEAD”). ELEAD’s automotive CRM software and call center solutions enable interaction between sales, service
and marketing operations to provide dealers with an integrated customer acquisition and retention platform. The
acquisition of ELEAD was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which required, among other
things, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their respective fair values as of the acquisition
date. The acquisition was made pursuant to an equity purchase agreement, which contained customary
representations, warranties, covenants, and indemnities by the sellers and the Company. The Company acquired all
of the outstanding equity of ELEAD for a purchase price of $513.0 million, net of cash acquired of $7.0 million.

The following table summarizes the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the
acquisition date:

Cash and cash equivalents ..................................................................................................................... $ 7.0
Intangible assets .................................................................................................................................... 132.0
Other assets............................................................................................................................................ 37.1
Other liabilities ...................................................................................................................................... (35.5)
Total identifiable net assets ................................................................................................................... $ 140.6
Goodwill ................................................................................................................................................ 379.4

Total consideration ................................................................................................................................ $ 520.0

The amounts in the table above are reflective of measurement period adjustments made during fiscal year 2019,
which did not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, balance sheet or cash flows.

The intangible assets acquired primarily relate to customer lists, software, and trademarks, which are being
amortized over a weighted average useful life of 12 years. The goodwill resulting from this acquisition reflects
expected synergies resulting from adding ELEAD products and processes to the Company’s products and processes.
The acquired goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.

In December 2018, the Company sold the airplane acquired as part of the ELEAD acquisition for cash less costs
to sell of $6.7 million. Given the short time between the ELEAD acquisition and the sale of the acquired airplane,
the final purchase price allocated to the airplane was adjusted to equal the cash less costs to sell in accordance with
ASC 805, “Business Combinations” and ASC 360, “Property, Plant and Equipment.” As such, there was no gain or
loss recognized on the sale of the airplane.

The results of operations for ELEAD have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations from the
date of acquisition. The pro forma effects of this acquisition are not significant to the Company’s reported results for
any period presented. Accordingly, no pro forma financial statements have been presented herein.

In addition to the acquisition, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with the sellers. Under the
terms of the joint venture agreement, the Company contributed $10.0 million to the venture at the ELEAD
acquisition closing, committed to an additional $10.0 million in contributions over time, and acquired 50%
ownership in the joint venture. The Company’s contributions were expected to fund the initial operations of the joint
venture. Under ASC 810, “Consolidation,” the joint venture was determined to be a variable interest entity;
however, the Company was not considered the primary beneficiary. As such, the joint venture was accounted for as
an equity method investment and the initial $10.0 million contribution was recorded as an investment on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company entered into a joint venture
termination agreement with the former owners of ELEAD in exchange for a termination payment of $7.0 million.


-----

The initial $10.0 million contribution and the $7.0 million termination payment were recorded as a loss from equity
method investment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

**Note 6. Revenue**

**_Contract Balances_**

_Accounts Receivable_

A receivable is recorded when an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment exists, such that only the
passage of time is required before payment of consideration is due. The Company receives payments from
customers based upon contractual billing schedules. Payment terms can vary by contract but the period between
invoicing and when payments are due is not significant. The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the
timing of invoicing to customers. Included in accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are unbilled
receivable balances which have not yet been invoiced. As of June 30, 2021, the balance of accounts receivable, net
of allowances for doubtful accounts, was $236.4 million, inclusive of unbilled receivables of $1.8 million. As of
June 30, 2020, the balance of accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, was $242.0 million,
inclusive of unbilled receivables of $1.3 million.

_Contract Assets_

A contract asset is recognized when a conditional right to consideration exists and transfer of control has
occurred. Contract assets are typically related to subscription contracts where the transaction price allocated to the
satisfied performance obligation exceeds the value of billings to-date. Contract assets are reported in a net position
on a contract-by-contract basis and are included in other current assets for the current portion and other assets for the
long-term portion on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company regularly reviews contract asset balances for
impairment, considering factors such as historical experience, credit-worthiness, age of the balance, and other
economic or business factors. Refer to Note 11 – Allowance for Credit Losses for more information about contract
assets exposure to credit losses. Contract asset impairments were not significant in the twelve months ended June 30,
2021. Contract assets were $64.3 million and $77.2 million as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

_Deferred Revenue_

The Company’s deferred revenue primarily consists of payments received from customers, or such
consideration that is contractually due, in advance of providing the product or performing services. Deferred revenue
is reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. As of June 30, 2021
and June 30, 2020, the deferred revenue balance was $69.0 million and $84.0 million, respectively. For the years
ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized revenue of $76.5 million, $99.8 million, and $112.5
million, respectively, related to its deferred revenue.

**Remaining Performance Obligations. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance**
obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The following information
represents the total transaction price for the remaining performance obligations as of June 30, 2021 related to noncancelable contracts, including contracts less than one year in duration, that is expected to be recognized over future
periods. In each case the fiscal period represents the year ended June 30.

As of June 30, 2021, the Company had $2.6 billion of remaining performance obligations which represent
contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, including contracted revenue where the contract’s original
expected duration is one year or less. The Company expects to recognize approximately $950.0 million of the
remaining performance obligations as revenue for fiscal 2022, $700.0 million for fiscal 2023, $490.0 million for
fiscal year 2024, $290.0 million for fiscal 2025, $150.0 million for fiscal 2026, and $20.0 million thereafter. The
remaining performance obligations exclude future transaction revenue where revenue is recognized as the services
are rendered and in the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice.

**Costs to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract. The Company capitalizes certain contract acquisition costs consisting**
primarily of commissions incurred when contracts are signed. The Company does not capitalize commissions related
to contracts with a duration of less than one year; such commissions are expensed in selling, general and


-----

administrative expenses when incurred. Costs to fulfill contracts are capitalized when such costs are direct and
related to transition or installation activities for hosted software solutions. Capitalized costs to fulfill contracts
primarily include travel and employee compensation and benefit related costs for the Company’s implementation
and training teams. Capitalized costs to obtain a contract and most costs to fulfill a contract are amortized over a
period of five years which represents the expected period of benefit of these costs. In instances where the contract
term is significantly less than five years, costs to fulfill are amortized over the contract term which the Company
believes best reflects the period of benefit of these costs.

As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company capitalized contract acquisition and fulfillment costs of $195.7
million and $178.7 million, respectively. The Company expects that incremental commission fees incurred as a
result of obtaining contracts and fulfillment costs are recoverable. During fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company
recognized cost amortization of $73.9 million, $72.4 million, and $71.7 million, respectively, and there were no
significant impairment losses.

**Revenue Disaggregation. The following table presents revenue by category for twelve months ended June 30,**
2021, 2020 and 2019:

**Year Ended June 30,**

**2021** **2020** **2019**

Total Revenue ............................................................................... $ 1,673.2 $ 1,639.0 $ 1,593.0

**Note 7. Restructuring**

**Business Transformation Plan. During fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, the Company initiated a three-year**
business transformation plan designed to increase operating efficiency and improve the Company’s cost structure in
its operations. As the Company executed the business transformation plan, the Company continually monitored,
evaluated and refined its structure, including its design, goals, term and estimate and allocation of total restructuring
expenses. As part of this ongoing review process, during fiscal 2017, the Company extended the business
transformation plan by one year through fiscal 2019. The Company incurred $156.6 million of accumulative other
business transformation expense to execute the plan through its completion at the end of fiscal 2019. In addition, the
Company has recognized cumulative restructuring expenses of $59.5 million since the inception of the business
transformation plan in fiscal 2015 through its completion at the end of fiscal 2019.

Restructuring expenses associated with the business transformation plan included employee-related costs, which
represent severance and other termination-related benefits calculated based on long-standing benefit practices and
local statutory requirements, and contract termination costs, which include costs to terminate facility leases. The
business transformation plan was completed at the end of fiscal year 2019.

There were no outstanding restructuring liabilities as of June 30, 2021 and 2020.

**Note 8. Stock-Based Compensation**

**Incentive Equity Awards Granted by the Company. The Company’s 2014 Omnibus Award Plan (“2014**
Plan”) provides for the granting of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, other stock-based awards, and performance compensation awards to
employees, directors, officers, consultants, advisors, and those of the Company’s affiliates. The 2014 Plan provides
for an aggregate of 12.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock to be reserved for issuance and is effective
for a period of ten years. As of June 30, 2021, there were 2.7 million shares available for issuance under the 2014
Plan. The Company reissues treasury stock to satisfy issuances of common stock upon option exercise, equity
vesting, or grants of restricted stock.


-----

The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense associated with employee equity awards in net
earnings based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they
occur. Stock-based compensation primarily consisted of the following:

**Time-Based Stock Options and Performance-Based Stock Options. Time-based stock options and**
performance-based stock options have a term of ten years. Upon termination of employment, unvested stock options
are evaluated for forfeiture or modification, subject to the terms of the awards and Company policies.

Time-based stock options are granted to employees at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the
Company’s common stock on the date of grant and are generally issued under a three or four-year graded vesting
schedule.

Performance-based stock options are granted to the CEO at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of
the Company’s stock on the date of grant. These awards vest, subject to the Company’s stock price performance and
the CEO’s continued employment with the Company, over a three-year performance period.

**Time-Based Restricted Stock and Time-Based Restricted Stock Units. Time-based restricted stock and**
restricted stock units generally vest over a two to five-year period. Upon termination of employment, unvested timebased awards are evaluated for forfeiture or modification, subject to the terms of the awards and Company policies.

Time-based restricted stock cannot be transferred during the vesting period. Compensation expense related to
the issuance of time-based restricted stock is measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date and
recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Employees are eligible to receive cash dividends on the
CDK shares awarded under the time-based restricted stock program during the restricted period.

Time-based restricted stock units are primarily settled in cash for non-U.S. recipients and may be settled in
stock or cash for U.S. recipients at the discretion of the Company and cannot be transferred during the restriction
period. Compensation expense related to the issuance of time-based restricted stock units is recorded over the
vesting period and is initially based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. Cash-settled, time-based
restricted stock units are subsequently remeasured at each reporting date during the vesting period to the current
stock value. For grants made prior to September 6, 2018, no dividend equivalents are paid on units awarded during
the restricted period. For grants made on or subsequent to September 6, 2018, U.S. recipients are credited with
dividend equivalents on units awarded during the restricted period, and no dividend equivalents are paid or credited
on units awarded to non-U.S. recipients during the restricted period.

**Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units. Performance-based restricted stock units generally vest over a**
three-year performance period. Under these programs, the Company communicates “target awards” at the beginning
of the performance period with possible payouts at the end of the performance period ranging from 0% to 260% of
the “target awards”. Certain performance-based awards are further subject to adjustment based on a market
condition, defined as total stockholder return of the Company’s common stock compared to a peer group of
companies. The probability associated with the achievement of performance conditions affects the vesting of the
Company’s performance-based awards. Expense is only recognized for those shares expected to vest. Upon
termination of employment, unvested awards are evaluated for forfeiture or modification, subject to the terms of the
awards and Company policies.

Performance-based restricted stock units are settled in either cash or stock for employees whose home country
is the U.S. at the discretion of the Company, and are settled in cash for all other employees and cannot be transferred
during the vesting period. Compensation expense related to the issuance of performance-based restricted stock units
settled in cash is recorded over the vesting period, is initially based on the fair value of the award on the grant date
and is subsequently remeasured at each reporting date to the current stock value during the performance period,
based upon the probability that the performance target will be met. Compensation expense related to the issuance of
performance-based restricted stock units settled in stock is recorded over the vesting period based on the fair value
of the award on the grant date. Prior to settlement, dividend equivalents are earned on “target awards” under the
performance-based restricted stock unit program.

The following table represents stock-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefits for fiscal
2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively:

As of June 30, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options and restricted
stock units was $2.9 million and $73.5 million, respectively, which will be amortized over the weighted average
remaining requisite service periods of 1.8 years and 2.0 years, respectively. There was no unrecognized
compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock awards as of June 30, 2021.

The activity related to the Company’s incentive equity awards for fiscal 2021, including amounts attributable to
the Company’s discontinued operations, consisted of the following:

The Company received proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $2.5 million, $6.2 million, and $5.0
million during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised
during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 was approximately $1.0 million, $3.3 million, and $5.0 million, respectively.

The Binomial model used to determine the grant date fair value of the time-based stock options granted in the
first quarter of fiscal 2021 used an expected volatility based on the average of implied volatility and historical stock


-----

price volatility for the Company, the average of which was 33.0%, a risk-free interest rate of 0.4%, an expected
dividend yield of 1.4%, and weighted average expected life of 6 years.

The Monte Carlo simulation model used to determine the grant date fair value of the total three-year
performance-based restricted stock units granted during fiscal 2021 used an expected volatility based on historical
stock price volatility for the Company and the peer companies, the average of which was 31.7% and a risk-free


-----

interest rate of 0.2%. Because these awards earn dividend equivalents, the model did not assume an expected
dividend yield.

**Note 9. Employee Benefit Plans**

The Company offers a defined contribution savings plan. This plan covers all eligible full-time domestic
employees and provides company-matching contributions on a portion of employee contributions. The costs
recorded by the Company for this plan were $17.2 million, $16.5 million, and $15.4 million for fiscal 2021, 2020,
and 2019, respectively.

**Note 10. Earnings per Share**

The numerator for both basic and diluted earnings per share is net earnings attributable to CDK. The
denominator for basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the number of weighted average shares of the
Company’s common stock outstanding during the applicable reporting periods. Diluted earnings per share also
reflects the dilutive effect of unexercised in-the-money stock options and unvested restricted stock.

Holders of certain stock-based compensation awards are eligible to receive dividends as described in Note 8 Stock-Based Compensation.

The following table summarizes the components of basic and diluted earnings per share.

**June 30,**

**2021** **2020** **2019**
Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to CDK ... $181.5 $258.2 $187.2
Net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations ...................... 852.8 (50.7) (63.2)

Net earnings attributable to CDK ............................................... $1,034.3 $207.5 $124.0

Weighted average shares outstanding:
Basic ..................................................................................... 121.9 121.6 125.5
Effect of dilutive securities (1) .............................................. 0.7 0.5 0.9

Diluted .................................................................................. 122.6 122.1 126.4

Net earnings (loss) attributable to CDK per share - basic:
Continuing operations ................................................................ $1.48 $2.13 $1.49
Discontinued operations ............................................................. 7.00 (0.42) (0.50)

Total net earnings attributable to CDK per share – basic ........... $8.48 $1.71 $0.99

Net earnings (loss) attributable to CDK per share - diluted:
Continuing operations ................................................................ $1.48 $2.12 $1.48
Discontinued operations ............................................................. 6.96 (0.42) (0.50)

Total net earnings attributable to CDK per share – diluted ........ $8.44 $1.70 $0.98

(1) The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock, and performance share

units is reflected in the diluted weighted average shares outstanding using the treasury stock method.

The weighted average number of shares outstanding used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share does
not include the effect of anti-dilutive securities. The potential common shares excluded were 1.1 million, 1.0
million, and 0.5 million for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

**Note 11. Allowance for Credit Losses**

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, which requires the application of a current expected credit loss
impairment model (“CECL”) to financial assets measured at amortized cost (including trade accounts receivable),
net investments in leases, and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Under CECL, lifetime expected credit
losses on such financial assets are measured and recognized at each reporting date based on historical, current, and


-----

forecasted information. Furthermore, CECL requires financial assets with similar risk characteristics to be analyzed
on a collective basis.

On July 1, 2020, the Company adopted CECL using a modified retrospective approach. The noncash
cumulative effect of adopting CECL resulted in a decrease of $8.2 million, net of tax impacts, to retained earnings,
with corresponding increases to the allowance for expected credit losses impacting accounts receivable, net, other
current assets and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cumulative-effect adjustment in retained
earnings includes amounts related to the International Business, which represented an impact upon adoption of $1.2
million, net of tax. At adoption, there was no impact on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Cash Flows. The impacts related to prior comparative periods have not been restated and continue to be reported
under the accounting standards in effect for the prior periods.

Credit loss expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations. The following table provides a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the
amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected as of June 30, 2021.

**Balance as of June 30, 2021 ..................................** $ 6.3 $ 0.7 $ 9.2 $ 16.2

**Note 12. Property, Plant and Equipment, Net**

Depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment was $40.0 million, $49.0 million, and $49.2 million for
fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Property, plant and equipment at cost and accumulated depreciation
consisted of the following:

**CDK as a Lessee. For fiscal 2021, the Company recorded leases expense of $26.7 million in cost of revenue,**
$3.1 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, and $0.5 million in interest expense, in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. For fiscal 2020, the Company recorded lease expense of $24.6 million in
cost of revenue, $2.7 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, and $0.9 million in interest expense, in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Other intangibles consist primarily of purchased rights, covenants, and patents (acquired directly or through
acquisitions). All of the intangible assets have finite lives and, as such, are subject to amortization. Amortization of
intangible assets from continuing operations was $58.7 million, $42.7 million, and $31.2 million for fiscal 2021,
2020, and 2019, respectively.

**April 1, 2021, 2020 and 2019 Impairment Analysis. The Company completed its annual impairment analysis**
as of April 1, 2021 and 2020. For all reporting units, the Company performed a quantitative analysis. Based on the
results of the quantitative analysis, the Company determined that the fair values of all reporting units exceeded their
carrying values and no impairment existed.

During fiscal 2019, the Company recorded impairment charges of $13.2 million for software and $1.7 million
for customer lists. Of the total $14.9 million impairment charge, the Company recorded $12.0 million in cost of
revenue and $2.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

Estimated future amortization expense related to existing intangible assets is as follows:

**Amount**
Year ending June 30,

**Note 15. Investments**

As of June 30, 2021, the Company’s equity investments principally comprised a 15% ownership interest in
Ansira and a 50% ownership interest in Open Dealer Exchange (“ODE”). ODE processes certain credit bureau and
other credit related transactions on behalf of the Company. The operations of ODE are integral to the Company’s
business due to the access ODE has to credit bureaus, which provides an extension of the business over a critical
functional area. As a result, the Company records earnings related to the investment in costs of revenues in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company incurred
expenses from ODE of $17.6 million, $13.7 million, and $12.3 million, respectively, in cost of revenues in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. During fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company made payments to ODE
of $14.9 million, $14.6 million, and $13.4 million, respectively.

investments.

In addition, the Company has a 10-year note receivable due 2030, with respect to one of its equity investments.
As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the note receivable was $27.3 million and $24.4 million, respectively, recorded in
other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Other investments include entities where the Company does not have significant influence over the operating or
financial policy and their fair values are not readily determinable. Therefore, the Company has elected to measure
these investments at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairment.

**Credit Facility. The Company has a variable rate senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “revolving**
credit facility”). The revolving credit facility provides up to $750.0 million of borrowing capacity and includes a
sub-limit of up to $100.0 million for loans denominated in euro, pound sterling, and, if approved by the revolving
lenders, other currencies. The average outstanding balances of the revolving credit facility were $42.7 million and
$122.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The revolving credit facility contains various covenants and restrictive provisions that limit the Company’s
subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness, the Company’s ability to consolidate or merge with other
entities, and the Company’s subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, and enter
into agreements restricting the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to pay dividends. If the Company fails to
perform the obligations under these and other covenants, the revolving credit facility could be terminated and any
outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest, could be declared immediately due and payable. In addition
to customary events of default on the revolving credit facility, an event of default may also be triggered by the
acceleration of the maturity of any other indebtedness the Company may have in an aggregate principal amount in
excess of $75.0 million.

On May 24, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment of its revolving credit facility which includes an
extension of its maturity from August 2023 to May 2026, and amendments to its financial covenants. The amended
financial covenants provide that (i) the ratio of the Company’s total consolidated indebtedness to consolidated
EBITDA (the “Leverage Ratio”) may not exceed 3.75 to 1.00. Upon the occurrence of certain acquisitions for each
of the four consecutive fiscal quarters of the Company immediately following such certain acquisitions (including
the fiscal quarter in which such certain acquisition was consummated), the ratio set forth above will be increased to
4.25 to 1.00, and (ii) the ratio of the Company’s consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense may not be
less than 3.00 to 1.00. The related debt financing costs were not material to the consolidated financial statements.

**Term Loan Facilities. On March 1, 2021, the Company repaid in full the three-year and five-year term loan**
facilities. As a result, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt for the write-off of unamortized debt
financing costs of $2.2 million in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

**Unsecured Senior Notes. The senior notes have fixed interest rates, for which interest is paid semi-annually.**
The notes are redeemable at certain dates in whole or in part at the Company’s option. The redemption price would
be equal to, or in excess of, 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
plus the applicable “make-whole” premium.

On April 23, 2021, the Company repaid all indebtedness under the 2026 notes. As a result, the Company
recorded expenses of $18.5 million for the call premium and $4.8 million for the write-off of unamortized debt
financing costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.


-----

The senior notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and are not guaranteed by any of the
Company’s subsidiaries. The senior notes rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s existing and future
unsecured unsubordinated obligations, including the credit facilities. The senior notes contain covenants restricting
the Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness secured by liens, engage in sale/leaseback transactions, and
merge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. The senior notes are also subject to a
change of control provision whereby each holder of the senior notes has the right to require the Company to
purchase all or a portion of such holder’s senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of both a change of control and a decline in the rating
of the senior notes.

**Finance Lease Liabilities. The Company has lease agreements for equipment, which are classified as finance**
lease liabilities. Refer to Note 13 - Leases for scheduled maturities and additional information relating to finance
lease liabilities.

**Fair Value. The fair values of the senior notes were estimated using quoted market prices for identical**
liabilities that are traded in over-the-counter secondary markets that are not considered active. The carrying value of
the term loans, including accrued interest, approximates fair value based on the Company’s current estimated
incremental borrowing rate for similar types of arrangements. The senior notes and term loans are classified as Level
2 (direct or indirect observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets) in the fair value hierarchy. The
carrying value of the revolving credit facility and finance lease liabilities approximates fair value.

The approximate fair values and related carrying values of the Company’s long-term debt, including current
maturities and excluding unamortized debt financing costs, are as follows:

**June 30,**

**2021** **2020**
Fair value ...................................................................................................................... $ 1,746.8 $ 2,790.5
Carrying value .............................................................................................................. 1,610.9 2,702.9

**Deferred Taxes on Unremitted Foreign Earnings.**

During the three months ended March 31, 2020, the Company began assessing the impact of the global
emergence of COVID-19 on its business. In response to the economic uncertainty engendered by the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic, the Company took steps to preserve cash and improve its liquidity position. The Company
reviewed its plans for foreign cash balances and, based on the increase in uncertainty and higher expected U.S. cash
needs associated with the pandemic, the Company removed its assertion that foreign earnings were indefinitely
reinvested, making these earnings available for repatriation as necessary. The Company has accrued $1.4 million
and $3.0 million of withholding tax liabilities on unremitted foreign earnings on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as
of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

**Carryforward Attributes. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had federal capital losses of $13.4 million which**
expire in 2024 and pre-apportioned state capital losses of $13.4 million which expire in 2024 through 2034. The
Company has $63.2 million of federal net operating losses, a portion of which begin to expire in 2033, and $42.8
million of post-apportioned state net operating losses, a portion of which begin to expire in 2023, both the federal
and state net operating losses were derived from fiscal 2021 acquisitions. The Company had no foreign net operating
loss carryforwards as of June 30, 2021.

The Company had U.S. federal foreign tax credits of $1.8 million which expire in 2031, U.S. federal research
and development credits of $0.3 million which begin to expire in 2037, and state tax credits of $0.2 million which
expire in 2023.


-----

**Valuation Allowances. The Company has recorded valuation allowances of $13.6 million and $5.7 million as**
of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, because the Company has concluded it is more likely than not that it will be
unable to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards and certain U.S. tax credits. As
of each reporting date, the Company’s management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, which
could impact management’s determination with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets.

During fiscal 2021, the valuation allowance balance increased $7.9 million, primarily related to $7.7 million
valuation allowance recorded on a deferred tax asset for the tax basis difference of an equity method investment that
is not expected to be realized.

During fiscal 2020, the valuation allowance balance decreased $4.6 million, which included a decrease of $18.4
million due to the expiration of a U.S. capital loss carryforward on June 30, 2020 and an increase of $14.8 million
related to a reversal of the fiscal year 2019 capital gain the Company previously expected to recognize in
conjunction with the sale of the assets of the Digital Marketing Business.

**Unrecognized Income Tax Benefits. As of June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company had unrecognized**
income tax benefits of $23.0 million, $24.8 million, and $8.2 million, respectively of which $3.9 million, $8.1
million, and $7.0 million, respectively, would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized. The remainder, if
recognized, would principally affect deferred taxes.

A roll-forward of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

**June 30,**

**2021** **2020** **2019**
Beginning balance ................................................................................ $ 22.6 $ 7.8 $ 6.2
Increase related to current year tax positions........................................ 0.5 1.1 1.6
Increase related to prior year tax positions ........................................... 0.9 15.8 0.8
Decrease related to prior year tax positions .......................................... (0.2) (1.0) —
Decrease related to settlements with tax authorities ............................. (0.3) — (0.1)
Decrease related to lapse of the statute of limitations .......................... (1.4) (1.0) (0.7)
Increase related to business combinations ............................................ 0.2 — —
Decrease related to divestiture .............................................................. (1.9) (0.1) —

Ending balance ..................................................................................... $ 20.4 $ 22.6 $ 7.8

The Company’s net unrecognized income tax benefits were impacted by a decrease of $2.2 million, an increase
of $14.8 million, and an increase of $1.6 million during fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Additionally,
fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were impacted by the sale of International Business. For all fiscal years, changes were
based on information which indicated the extent to which certain tax positions were more likely than not to be
sustained. Penalties and interest expense associated with uncertain income tax positions have been recorded in the
provision for income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Penalties and interest accrued during
fiscal 2021 were $0.8 million primarily related to changes in methodology related to transfer pricing. Penalties and
interest incurred in fiscal 2020, and 2019 were not significant. As of June 30, 2021, June 30, 2020, June 30, 2019,
respectively, the Company had $2.6 million, $2.2 million, and $0.4 million of penalties and interest associated with
uncertain tax positions, which was included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In addition, an offsetting long-term receivable of $17.7 million of tax and interest has been recorded as of June
30, 2021 as a result of the Company filing to obtain mutual agreement procedure consideration under applicable
U.S. and Canadian treaties for an update to transfer pricing policies. This long-term receivable is offset by $18.2
million of tax and interest recorded as uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2021.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state, local, and foreign
jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities. The tax
years currently under examination vary by jurisdiction. The Company regularly considers the likelihood of
assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations. The Company has established a liability for
unrecognized income tax benefits, which it believes to be adequate in relation to the potential assessments. Once
established, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted when there is more information available, when an


-----

event occurs necessitating a change, or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax
position has expired.

Income tax-related examinations currently in progress in which the Company has significant business
operations are as follows:

**Tax Jurisdictions** **Fiscal Years Ended**
Illinois 6/30/2017 thru 6/30/2018
Massachusetts 6/30/2018 thru 6/30/2020
New York 6/30/2017 thru 6/30/2019
India 3/31/2015 thru 3/31/2018
Canada 6/30/2012 and 6/30/2014

Based on the possible outcomes of the Company’s tax audits and expiration of the statute of limitations, it is
reasonably possible that the liability for uncertain tax positions will decrease in the next twelve months in the
potential amount of $19.1 million.

Although the final resolution of the Company’s tax disputes is uncertain, based on current information, the
resolution of tax matters is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
condition, liquidity, or results of operations. However, an unfavorable resolution could have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations in the periods in which the matters
are ultimately resolved.

**Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). On March 27, 2020, the**
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted into law. The primary impact
to the Company’s financial statements as a result of the CARES Act was the deferral of U.S. corporate income tax
payments from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 to the first quarter of fiscal 2021, as well as the deferral of
employer-related payroll tax payments from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, and first and second quarters of fiscal
2021, with 50% to be paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and the remaining 50% to be paid in the second
quarter of fiscal 2023.

**Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies**

**Legal Proceedings. From time to time, the Company is subject to various claims and is involved in various**
legal, regulatory, and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of its
business activities, including those noted in this section. Although management at present has no basis to conclude
that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will materially harm the
Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends, legal proceedings and related
government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur.
Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages. In addition, in matters for which injunctive
relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order
prohibiting the Company from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular
business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on
the Company’s business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. The Company might also
conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of its stockholders, employees, and customers,
and any such settlement could include substantial payments.

**Competition Matters. The Company is currently involved in, or where indicated, has settled, the following**
antitrust lawsuits that set forth allegations of anti-competitive agreements between the Company and The Reynolds
and Reynolds Company (“Reynolds”) relating to the manner in which the defendants control access to, and allow
integration with, their respective Dealer Management System (“DMS”), and that seek, among other things, treble
damages and injunctive relief. These lawsuits have been transferred to, or filed in, the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois for consolidated and coordinated pretrial proceedings as part of a multi-district litigation
proceeding (“MDL”).

**_Active MDL Lawsuits_**

 - Teterboro Automall, Inc. d/b/a Teterboro Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram (“Teterboro”) brought a putative class
action suit on behalf of itself and all similarly situated automobile dealerships against CDK Global, LLC
and Reynolds. Teterboro’s suit was originally filed on October 19, 2017, in the U.S. District Court for the
District of New Jersey. Since that time, several more putative class actions were filed in a number of
federal district courts, with substantively similar allegations; all of them have been consolidated with the
MDL proceeding. On June 4, 2018, a consolidated class action complaint was filed on behalf of a putative
class made up of all dealerships in the United States that directly purchased DMS and/or allegedly
indirectly purchased DMS or data integration services from CDK Global, LLC or Reynolds (“Putative
Dealership Class Plaintiffs”). CDK Global, LLC moved to dismiss the complaint, or in the alternative,
compel arbitration of certain of the cases while staying the remainder pending the outcome of those
arbitration proceedings; its motion to dismiss was granted in part and denied in part, while its motion to
compel arbitration was denied. On February 22, 2019, CDK Global, LLC filed an answer to the remaining
claims in Putative Dealership Class Plaintiffs’ complaint and asserted counterclaims against the Putative
Dealership Class Plaintiffs. The Putative Dealership Class Plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss CDK Global,
LLC’s counterclaims; that motion was granted in part and denied in part on September 3, 2019. On October
23, 2018, the Putative Dealership Class Plaintiffs and Reynolds filed a motion for preliminary approval of
settlement and for conditional certification of the proposed settlement class. The court finally approved that
settlement on January 22, 2019. The parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment and Daubert motions
were fully briefed as of September 28, 2020 and remain pending.

 - Loop LLC d/b/a AutoLoop (“AutoLoop”) brought suit against CDK Global, LLC on April 9, 2018, in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, but reserved its rights with respect to remand to the
U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin at the conclusion of the MDL proceedings. On
June 5, 2018, AutoLoop amended its complaint to sue on behalf of itself and a putative class of all other
automotive software vendors in the United States that purchased data integration services from CDK
Global, LLC or Reynolds. CDK Global, LLC moved to compel arbitration of AutoLoop’s claims, or in the
alternative, to dismiss those claims; that motion was denied on January 25, 2019. CDK Global, LLC filed
an answer to AutoLoop’s complaint and asserted counterclaims against AutoLoop on February 15, 2019.
AutoLoop filed an answer to CDK Global, LLC’s counterclaims on March 8, 2019. The parties’ crossmotions for summary judgment and Daubert motions were fully briefed as of September 28, 2020 and
remain pending.

**_Settled MDL Lawsuits_**

 - Authenticom, Inc. (“Authenticom”) brought a suit against CDK Global, LLC and Reynolds. Authenticom’s
suit was originally filed on May 1, 2017, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin.
On October 20, 2020, CDK Global, LLC and Authenticom entered into a settlement agreement that
resulted in a dismissal of all claims brought by Authenticom in the MDL, and CDK Global, LLC making a
one-time cash payment to Authenticom.

 - i3 Brands, Inc. and PartProtection LLC (“i3 Brands”) brought suit against CDK Global, LLC and Reynolds.
i3 Brands’ suit was originally filed on February 4, 2019, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of California; it was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois
and consolidated as part of the MDL. On March 4, 2020, CDK Global, LLC and i3 Brands entered into a
settlement agreement that resulted in a dismissal of all claims brought by i3 Brands against CDK in the
MDL, and CDK Global, LLC agreeing to a release of i3 Brands and an agreement to abandon all claims
against i3 Brands.

 - Motor Vehicle Software Corporation (“MVSC”) brought a suit against CDK Global, LLC (after initially
naming the Company), Reynolds, and CVR, a majority owned joint venture of the Company. MVSC’s suit
was originally filed on February 3, 2017, in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. On
October 10, 2019, CDK Global, LLC and MVSC entered into a settlement agreement that resulted in a
dismissal of all claims brought by MVSC in the MDL as against CDK Global, LLC and CVR, and CDK
Global, LLC making a one-time cash payment to MVSC.

  - Cox Automotive, along with multiple subsidiaries (“Cox”), brought suit against CDK Global, LLC. Cox’s
suit was originally filed on December 11, 2017, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Wisconsin. On July 10, 2019, CDK Global, LLC and Cox entered into a settlement agreement that resulted
in a dismissal of all claims brought by the affiliated parties in the MDL, and CDK Global, LLC making a
one-time cash payment to Cox.

The Company believes that the remaining unsettled cases are without merit and will continue to vigorously
contest all asserted claims. Nonetheless, in light of the Company’s settlements with Authenticom, i3 Brands, MVSC,
and Cox and its continued expenditure of legal costs to contest the remaining claims, the Company has determined
that a loss of some measure is probable and can be reasonably estimated. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the
Company initially recorded a litigation provision of $90.0 million and has continued to re-assess the liability in each
subsequent quarter. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company’s reassessment of its litigation liability resulted
in an increase of $12.0 million. As of June 30, 2021, and 2020, the litigation liability for the remaining unsettled
cases was $34.0 million and $57.0 million, respectively. This estimated loss is based upon currently available
information and represents the Company’s best estimate of such loss. Estimating the value of this estimated loss
involved significant judgment given the uncertainty that still exists with respect to the remaining unsettled cases due
to a variety of factors typical of complex, large scale litigation, including, among others: (i) formative issues,
including: (a) the causes of action the plaintiffs can pursue; (b) the definition of the class(es) of plaintiffs; (c) the
types of damages that can be recovered; and (d) whether plaintiffs can establish loss causation as a matter of law, all
of which have yet to be determined pending the outcome of dispositive motions (e.g., motions for class certification
and motions for summary judgment); (ii) significant factual issues remain to be resolved; (iii) expert perspectives
with respect to, among other things, alleged antitrust injury and damages is widely divergent and remains subject to
dispositive motions; (iv) the absence of productive settlement discussions to date with the remaining plaintiffs; and
(v) the novel or uncertain nature of the legal issues presented. For these same reasons, the Company cannot
reasonably estimate a maximum potential loss exposure at this time. In addition, the Company’s estimate does not
incorporate or reflect the potential value of the Company’s counterclaims against certain of the plaintiffs in the
ongoing cases. The legal proceedings underlying the estimated litigation liability will change from time to time and
actual results may vary significantly from the estimate. As noted above, an adverse result in any of the remaining
cases could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, or
liquidity.

On June 22, 2017, the Company received from the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) a Civil Investigative
Demand consisting of specifications calling for the production of documents relating to any agreements between the
Company and Reynolds. Parallel document requests have been received from certain states’ Attorneys General.
Since 2017, the Company has engaged in continuing communication with and received subsequent requests from the
FTC related to its investigation. The Company has responded to the requests and no proceedings have been
instituted. The Company believes there has not been any conduct by the Company or its current or former
employees that would be actionable under the antitrust laws in connection with the agreements between the
Company and Reynolds or otherwise. At this time, the Company does not have sufficient information to predict the
outcome of, or the cost of responding to or resolving, these investigations.

**Other Commitments and Contingencies. In the normal course of business, the Company may enter into**
contracts in which the Company makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the
Company’s services and products. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations
and warranties.

The Company has provided approximately $28.1 million of guarantees as of June 30, 2021 in the form of surety
bonds issued to support certain licenses and contracts which require a surety bond as a guarantee of performance of
contractual obligations. In general, the Company would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the
event the Company defaulted in performing the obligations under each contract, of which, the probability is remote.

The Company has a total of $45.4 million of outstanding purchase commitments and contracts with expiration
dates through 2025.

The Company had a total of $1.8 million in letters of credit outstanding as of June 30, 2021 primarily in
connection with insurance programs.

**Note 19. Share Repurchase Transactions**

In January 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of its common
stock as part of a return of capital plan. Under the authorization, the Company may purchase its common stock in
the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time as permitted by federal securities laws and
other legal requirements. The actual timing, number, and price of any shares to be repurchased is determined at
management’s discretion and depends on a number of factors, including the market price of the shares, general
market and economic conditions, and other potential uses for free cash flow including, but not limited to, potential
acquisitions.

In November 2018, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (“November 2018
ASR”) to purchase $260.0 million of the Company’s common stock. Under the terms of the November 2018 ASR,
the Company made a $260.0 million payment in November 2018 and received initial delivery of approximately 4.1
million of the Company’s common stock. In February 2019, the Company received an additional 1.1 million shares
of common stock in final settlement of the November 2018 ASR, for a total of 5.2 million shares. The value
reflected in treasury stock upon completion of the November 2018 ASR represents the value of the shares received
based on the closing price of the Company’s stock on the respective settlement dates, which is higher than the
$260.0 million cash paid by $13.0 million.

In 2019, the Company made open market repurchases of 4.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock
during fiscal 2019 for a total cost of $264.1 million.

Additionally, in June 2021, the Company made open market repurchases of 236 thousand shares of the
Company’s common stock for a total cost of $12.1 million.
